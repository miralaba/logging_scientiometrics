While ecological responses of vertebrate assemblages to habitat modification are variable, such understanding is critical to appropriate conservation planning of anthropogenic landscapes. We assessed the responses of medium/large-bodied mammal assemblages to the ecological impacts of reduced impact logging, secondary regrowth, and eucalyptus and oil palm plantations in Eastern Brazilian Amazonia. We used within-landscape paired baseline-treatment comparisons to examine the impact of different types of habitat modification in relation to adjacent primary forest. We examined assemblage-wide metrics including the total number of species, number of primary forest species retained in modified habitats, abundance, species composition, and community integrity. We ranked all types of habitat modification along a gradient of assemblage-wide impact intensity, with oil palm and eucalyptus plantations exerting the greatest impact, followed by secondary regrowth, and selectively logging. Selectively-logged and secondary forests did not experience discernible biodiversity loss, except for the total number of primary forest species retained. Secondary forests further experienced pronounced species turnover, with loss of community integrity. Considering the biodiversity retention capacity of anthropogenic habitats, this study reinforces the landscape-scale importance of setting aside large preserved areas. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"Mendes-Oliveira, A.C.; Instituto de Ciências Biológicas - LABEV, PA, Brazil; email: cris.mastozoologia@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123973581

In this case study, carried out in an ecotone forest in the northern Brazilian Amazon, we seek to demonstrate how forest management can became more sustainable through silvicultural prescriptions that reduce forest degradation and soil erosion. We evaluated the effects of the sustainable forest management (SFM) on tree diversity, timber volumes, and carbon stocks. A continuous forest inventory was carried out in nine 1-ha permanent plots (900 subplots of 100 m²), distributed in three treatments with three repetitions: T1 = control without selective logging, T2 = SFM, and T3 = SFM + silvicultural treatment of thinning release by tree girdling and poisoning. SFM was carried out with an average of three commercial timber trees harvested per hectare with DBH (diameter at breast height) ≥ 50 cm, corresponding to a timber volume of 20 ± 6 m3 ha-1, equivalent to the removal of 7 ± 2 Mg C ha-1 (5% of the original C). The formation of clearings (gaps) arising from the falling of exploited trees (0.12 ± 0.09 ha) resulted in greater impacts on the forest structure than the construction of 4 m skidder trails (0.06 ± 0.04 ha), with an average of 7 ± 4 damaged trees ha-1 and 5 ± 3 dead trees ha-1. Although six trees species became locally extinct, tree diversity was little altered, and timber volumes and forest carbon volume stocks remained essentially constant at this average logging intensity. Based on our results, sustainable forest management can become an efficient model for land use in the Amazon when harvesting is carried out using this average logging intensity. However, long-term monitoring studies using permanent plots in ecotone forests in the Brazilian Amazon will still be necessary. Quantifying, evaluating, and reporting impacts related to forest management will enable the formation of an empirical basis to support sustanaible forestry practices and for updating environmental legislation, contributing to local socioeconomic development, and maintaining the environmental services provided globally by tropical forests. © 2022","Forest carbon; Land use; Selective logging; Sustainable timber production; Tropical forest","Condé, T.M.; Universidade Estadual de Roraima (UERR), Av.

Improving the sustainability of logging will be crucial for meeting climate targets. Carbon-based payment for ecosystem service schemes, including REDD+, give economic value to standing forests and can protect them from degradation, but only if the revenue from carbon payments is greater than the opportunity cost of forgone or reduced logging. We currently lack understanding of whether carbon payments are feasible for protecting Amazonian forests from logging, despite the Amazon holding the largest unexploited timber reserves and an expanding logging sector. Using financial data and inventories of &gt;660,000 trees covering 52,000 ha of Brazilian forest concessions, we estimate the carbon price required to protect forests from logging. We estimate that a carbon price of $7.90 per tCO2 is sufficient to match the opportunity costs of all logging and fund protection of primary forest. Alternatively, improving the sustainability of logging operations by ensuring a greater proportion of trees are left uncut requires only slightly higher investments of $7.97–10.45 per tCO2. These prices fall well below the current compliance market rate and demonstrate a cost-effective opportunity to safeguard large tracts of the Amazon rainforest from further degradation. © 2022 The Authors","Amazon; Biodiversity; Carbon; Forest degradation; REDD+; Selective logging; Tropical forest","Bousfield, C.G.; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, United Kingdom; email: cbousfield1@sheffield.ac.uk

However, studies disentangling humipedon dynamics in tropical forests are scarce. The humipedon structure classification is important because it shows how forest ecosystems interact and react with (a)biotic factors. Here, we used the humus morpho-functional approach to investigate how soil texture and reduced impact-logging affect forest humipedon structure and dynamics in the eastern Amazon. We used a morpho-functional classification of humus forms as the foundation to visualize, classify, and code 133 soil profiles in two contrasting soil textures and different post-logging practices, to identify litter leaching, fragmentation, and humification processes coupled with soil aggregation and root dynamics. The classification of humus forms resulted in the identification of three humus systems: Mull, Moder and Amphi. Sandy and clayey textures differ statistically (χ2 = 51.83; p &lt; 0.001), with sandy texture predominating in Moder system, while clayey texture exhibits Amphi or Mull systems. Sandy textures presented a weak soil aggregation, but strong association with root (rhiOF) and humification (OH) horizons, leading to a clear transition between organic and mineral pools. In contrast, clayey textures show a strong carbon storage and soil aggregation. The humipedon horizons differ significantly (p = 0.009; stress = 0.1142 and R2 = 0.987) and their dynamics clearly evolve towards an opposite direction. The classification framework introduced here supports environmental management by promoting speed and viability in diagnosing forest ecosystem soils towards forest protection or use in the landscape, and specific climate mitigation goals both in local and regional planning. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon; Humus; Litter; Soil texture; Tropical soils","Vieira Cesário, F.; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Brazil; email: fernandovieiracesario@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127352303

Selective logging is a compromise that allows use of the land while leaving much of the forest canopy intact across a landscape. However, the ecological impacts of selective logging are unclear, with evidence of positive, negative, and negligible effects on forest structure and diversity. We examined the impact of selective logging on the structure and diversity of evergreen tropical forest in the Monts de Cristal region, a chain of mid-elevation hills in northwestern Gabon. For three size classes (seedling, sapling, and adult) of woody plant species, we tested whether forest structure (canopy openness, stem density, basal area, and relative liana abundances) and diversity were altered in forests that had been logged one year and ten years prior, compared to unlogged forest. In general, we found no large impact of selective logging treatment on the structure and diversity of adult woody plant communities, but the seedling and sapling communities were affected. Compared to unlogged forest, one-year post-logging forest had greater variation in canopy openness and lower sapling stem density. Ten-year post-logging forest had higher seedling and sapling species evenness, higher sapling species diversity, and higher relative abundance of sapling-sized lianas compared to unlogged forest. Our results show that key differences between intact and selectively logged forests persist in the understory at least a decade after logging. Overall, these results contribute an additional data point in the literature on selective logging, specifically representing the impacts of very low impact selective logging in Central African forests. Our study highlights the value of exploring selective logging impacts at multiple time periods of recovery, and makes an important contribution to the knowledge Central African managed forests. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Alpha diversity; Gabon; Liana increases; Selective logging; Tropical forest","Sullivan, M.K.195 Prospect Street, United States; email: sullivanmks@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127252984

In this study, we explored structure-function relationships across a variety of degradation levels in the southern Brazilian Amazon by 1) investigating how forest structural properties vary as a function of degradation history using airborne lidar data; 2) assessing the effects of degradation on solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) seasonality using TROPOMI data; and 3) quantifying the contribution of structural variables to SIF using multiple regression models with stepwise selection of lidar metrics. Forest degradation history was obtained through Landsat time-series classification. We found that fire, logging, and time since disturbance were major determinants of forest structure, and that forests affected by fires experienced larger variability in leaf area index (LAI), canopy height and vertical structure relative to logged and intact forests. Moreover, only recently burned forests showed significantly depressed SIF during the dry season compared to intact forests. Canopy height and the vertical distribution of foliage were the best predictors of SIF. Unexpectedly, we found that wet-season SIF was higher in active regenerating forests (~ 4 years after fires or logging) compared with intact forests, despite lower LAI.

Folivory has a major influence on tropical forests by affecting plant fitness and overall seedling performance. However, we do not know whether the predation of folivorous arthropods by birds, mammals, reptiles, and other arthropods is affected by anthropogenic disturbances such as selective logging and forest fires. We investigated the impacts of both pre-El Niño human disturbances and the 2015–2016 El Niño understorey fires on the predation of 4500 artificial caterpillars across 30 Amazonian forest plots. Plots were distributed in four pre-El Niño forest classes: undisturbed, logged, logged-and-burned, and secondary forests, of which 14 burned in 2015–16. We found a higher predation incidence in forests that burned during the El Niño in comparison with unburned ones. Moreover, logged-and-burned forests that burned again in 2015–16 were found to have significantly higher predation incidence by vertebrates than other forest classes. However, overall predation incidence in pre-El Niño forest disturbance classes was similar to undisturbed forests. Arthropods were the dominant predators of artificial caterpillars, accounting for 91.5% of total predation attempts. Our results highlight the resilience of predation incidence in human-modified forests, although the mechanisms underpinning this resilience remain unclear.

The greatest soil disturbance occurs in the logging infrastructure areas: skid trails, roads and log landings. Although landings generally occupy less of the site than skid trails and roads, they suffer severe compaction usually accompanied with complete topsoil removal to level the soil surface for log decking and loading. Few long-term studies have quantified if landing soil properties recover, with none in the humid tropical forests of Amazonia. The aim of this study was to determine if soil bulk density, penetration resistance and fine root biomass in 27-year-old abandoned log landings had returned to a similar state of the adjacent old-growth forest soils. The working hypothesis was that impacts on soil remained despite the regenerated stand of trees present on the landings. Results revealed that the soil physical properties in the log landings were still significantly higher than the controls. Furthermore, fine root biomass was still below the levels presented in the controls. Therefore, in log landings located on very clayey soils in Central Amazonia, soil compaction persists for at least 27 years. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bulk density; Fine root biomass; Forest management; Penetration resistance; Recovery; Seasonality","DeArmond, D.; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia - INPA, Av.

Soundscape analysis is a landscape-level approach to acoustic monitoring whereby acoustic indices are calculated as proxies for biodiversity based on all sounds occurring in a landscape, i.e. a soundscape. However, it is not fully understood what the influence is of environmental, anthropogenic and temporal heterogeneity on soundscapes and what soundscapes mean in terms of species diversity. Here, we use soundscape saturation, a proxy for acoustic diversity which calculates the degree of use of acoustic niches. We study how soundscape saturation responds to forest management and seasonality in the tropical forests of Gabon, while taking into account distance to rivers, human accessibility, signs of hunting, elevation and slope. To study the contribution of medium to large mammals to soundscape saturation, we relate soundscape saturation to the abundance of several animal guilds as estimated with camera trap data. Soundscape saturation was higher in a multi-use forest vs. logging concessions, in the rainy reason vs. the dry season, and in proximity of rivers and human access points. Elevation, slope, and hunting were less important covariates. We did not find strong evidence for a relationship between soundscape saturation and the abundance of several mammal guilds derived from camera traps. The lack of this relationship highlights the opportunity for a joint approach of eco-acoustics and camera trapping due to complementary species coverage. Our study provides the first soundscape saturation study in African tropical forests and the first to combine soundscape saturation with camera trap data. Soundscape saturation is considered a useful additional index for quantifying biodiversity across a range of land-use types. Future studies may aim to improve species inference and the site-specific interpretation of saturation levels by investigating species-specific contributions to, and spatiotemporal variation in, acoustic activity. © 2022 The Authors","Camera trapping; Central Africa; Eco-acoustics; Logging; Soundscapes; Tropical forest; Wildlife","Zwerts, J.A.; Ecology and Biodiversity, Padualaan 8, Netherlands; email: j.a.zwerts@uu.nl",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125455535

Surprisingly, logged forest (mean = 23.3 kg ha−1, SD = 48.9) produced more fruit litter than intact forest (mean = 16.7 kg ha−1, SD = 23.3), although the difference is not significant based on Student’s t test; t(66) = 0.702, p = 0.485. Pheno-phases could not be entirely explained by rainfall and temperature variables. Some evidence, however, indicates tree species composition, stand structure and sunlight exposure were likely determinants of flowering and fruit litter intensity. All things being equal, results imply selective logging if considerately practiced may increase food security for wildlife. The findings, however, should be interpreted with caution since tropical forest phenology and fruit productivity are also driven by a suite of small-scale edaphic attributes and large-scale spatio-temporal meteorological forcing. Although this research deals mainly with Borneo, the principles discussed and insights offered herein are valuable for furthering conversation around sustainable forestry in tropical Asia and elsewhere globally. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Society of Biometeorology.","Frugivore; Fruit; Insolation; Meteorology; Phenology","Wong, S.T.; Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre, PPM 219, Elopura, Sabah, Malaysia; email: wongsiew@hotmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123256292

However, they are disappearing rapidly due to forest clearing to extract timber illegally. Reduced-impact logging (RIL) is one of the main sustainability proposals for earning profits while still promoting biodiversity conservation. In the present study, we test the impacts of RIL on biodiversity and use the results to draw conclusions regarding the capacity of RIL to deliver conservation goals whilst also enabling minimal biodiversity impacts. We used a before-after-control-impact (BACI) study to assess the effects of RIL on a bat assemblage in Central Amazon. We sampled unlogged (control) and RIL areas before and after timber extraction. We also tested the relationship between forest canopy openness and bat assemblage before and after logging. For 64 nights, we captured 706 individuals of 33 Phyllostomidae species. Sampling time influenced total bat composition and phytophagous bat composition, both in logged and control sites. The time × site interaction influenced animalivorous bat composition and reduced the abundance and richness of animalivorous species in RIL sites. Sampling time, site, and the time × site interaction did not influence the number of species, total abundance, or phytophague abundance. The canopy was, on average, 3.4 times more open after the RIL and influenced animalivorous composition. Our results indicate that species sensitive to environmental changes, such as animalivorous bats, respond rapidly to forest logging. In more opportunistic guilds, such as phytophagues, the temporal change in the species composition in control and logged sites indicate that other temporal factors, besides logging, may have influenced bat assemblages. We suggest that RIL timber certification stimulates the protection of primary forest without logging within the area under exploration, which is not the case in the area we studied. We also recommend the application of BACI designs and monitoring environmental metrics in RIL impact studies. © 2021 The Zoological Society of London.","Amazon; BACI design; forest disturbance; reduced-impact logging; tropical forest; vegetation structure","Castro, A.B.; Laboratório de Ecologia e Conservação, Pará, Brazil; email: arlisonbio@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114244151

This study examined the effects of landscape and habitat characteristics on the lesser mouse-deer, Tragulus kanchil, populations in Peninsular Malaysia. We conducted camera-trap survey at 315 sampling points located within 8 forest reserves. An assessment of site-level and landscape variables was conducted at each sampling point. Our study provides critical ecological information for managing and conserving understudied populations of T. kanchil. We found that the detection of T. kanchil was attributed to forest fragmentation in which forest patches had four times greater detection of T. kanchil than continuous forest. The detection of T. kanchil was nearly three times higher in peat swamp forest compared to lowland dipterocarp forests. Surprisingly, the detection of T. kanchil was higher in logged forests (logging ceased at least 30 years ago) than unlogged forests. The detection of T. kanchil increased with the presence of trees, particularly those with DBH of 5 cm to 45 cm, canopy cover, number of saplings and palms, number of dead fallen trees, and distance from nearest roads. However, detection decreased with a greater number of trees with DBH greater than 45 cm and higher elevations, and greater detections where creeping bamboo was abundant. We recommend that conservation stakeholders take the necessary steps (e.g., eradicating poaching, habitat degradation, and further deforestation) to support the conservation of mouse-deer species and its natural habitats. © 2022 The Authors.

Our study evaluated forest regrowth after different logging and thinning techniques applied to 60 one-hectare forest subplots in East Kalimantan that were logged using selective conventional and reduced-impact techniques. We used seven functional traits to compare the short-term (∼1-year) and longer-term (∼10-year) changes in functional diversity and composition of the forest. Both conventional and reduced impact logging resulted in higher functional diversity after 10 years, but forest functional traits shifted away from those observed in unlogged (control) subplots. Reduced-impact logging led to smaller deviations in functional composition compared to unlogged forest. We found that low-intensity reduced-impact logging, i.e., &lt;3 m2 ha−1 (equivalent to 5 trees ha−1 or approximately 42 m3 ha−1), maintained functional diversity equivalent to unlogged forest measured in 12 one-hectare control plots. Selectively logged forest subplots with liberation thinnings increased functional diversity while leaving the trait composition unchanged. Thinned subplots exhibited higher functional diversity than the un-thinned subplots and greater similarity to unlogged forest. However, high-intensity thinning, i.e., &gt;10 m2 ha−1, resulted in large functional traits shifts away from unlogged forest. Our study suggests that preserving the original forest functionality, i.e., by applying low intensity, reduced-impact logging and thinning operations, represents a sustainable strategy for long-term tropical forest management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Forest functioning; Forest succession; Functional traits; Liberation thinning intervention; Logging intensity; Reduced-impact logging","Mahayani, N.P.D.; Faculty of Forestry, Jalan Agro No. 1 Bulaksumur, Indonesia",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121922918

The present study is aimed to investigate the diversity of medicinal plants exposed to different levels of anthropogenic disturbance in TDFs. For this study, we selected six forest regions, covering a radius of 25 km, and exposed to variable intensity of disturbances, in the form of illegal logging, cattle grazing and fire. Based on the intensity of three disturbances, we categorized the study sites as low (LDS) and high (HDS) disturbed sites, and analyzed differences in soil properties and vegetation parameters in the two disturbance categories. We recorded tree density, tree species richness and herbaceous species richness in 100 m2 quadrats at the selected regions. Results exhibited significantly greater soil organic C (LDS, 4.6%; HDS, 0.9%; P &lt; 0.001), water holding capacity (LDS, 47.4%; HDS, 33.6%; P &lt; 0.001), and sand content (LDS, 53.7%; HDS, 48.3%; P &lt; 0.001) across LDS, whereas significantly higher bulk density (LDS, 1.30 gcm–3; HDS, 1.34 gcm–3; P &lt; 0.05) and gravel content (LDS, 14.6%; HDS, 20.0%; P &lt; 0.001) across HDS. We found considerable shift in relationships between vegetation parameters under the two disturbance regimes. The results indicated that many of the important medicinal plants (e.g., Adina cordifolia, Bauhinia vahlii, Holarrhena antidysenterica, Asparagus racemosus, Curculigo orchioides, Hemidesmus indicus, etc.) which are potential constituents of several ayurvedic preparations as well as of traditional medical systems are lacking from the HDS, either due to direct impact of disturbances or indirectly due to disturbance induced changes in soil properties. For instance, the high grazing pressure increased soil compaction, leading to increase in bulk density and decline in water holding capacity of soil. We suggest that forest managers take into consideration the presence of anthropogenic disturbances in their management and conservation efforts of medicinal plants in TDFs.

Lianas compete intensely with trees, reducing nearly all aspects of tree performance. However, the negative effects of lianas on trees have never been combined and quantified for multiple tropical forests. Here, we present the first comprehensive standardized quantification of the effect of lianas on trees across tropical forests worldwide. We used data from 50 liana removal experiments and quantified the effect size of lianas on tree growth, biomass accretion, reproduction, mortality, leaf water potential, sap flow velocity, and leaf area index (LAI) across different forest types. Using a three-level mixed-effect meta-analysis, we found unequivocal evidence that lianas significantly reduce tree growth and biomass accretion in ecological, logging, and silvicultural studies. Lianas also significantly reduce tree reproduction, recruitment, and physiological performance. The relative detrimental effect of lianas on trees does not increase in drier forests, where lianas tend to be more abundant. Our results highlight the substantial liana-induced reduction in tree performance and biomass accumulation, and they provide quantitative data on the effects of lianas on trees that are essential for large-scale plant demographic and ecosystem models that predict forest change and carbon dynamics.

The near real-time (NRT) change detection of forest cover loss enables forest landowners, government agencies and local communities to monitor natural and anthropogenic disturbances in a much timelier fashion than the thematic maps that are released every year. NRT deforestation alerts enable the establishment of more up-to-date forest inventories and rapid responses to unlicensed logging. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites provide operational Earth observation (EO) data from multi-spectral optical/near-infrared wavelengths every five days at a global scale and at 10 m resolution. The amount of acquired data requires cloud computing or high-performance computing for ongoing monitoring systems and an automated system for processing, analyzing and delivering the information promptly. Here, we present a Sentinel-2-based NRT change detection system, assess its performance over two study sites, Manantlán in Mexico and Cartagena del Chairá in Colombia, and evaluate the forest changes that occurred in 2018. An independent validation with very high-reso-lution PlanetScope (~3 m) and RapidEye (~5 m) data suggests that the proposed NRT change detection system can accurately detect forest cover loss (> 87%), other vegetation loss (> 76%) and other vegetation gain (> 71%). Furthermore, the proposed NRT change detection system is designed to be attuned using in situ data.

We made new species-specific estimates of diameter increments and mortality rates, and investigated how tree growth varied with tree size and logging history. We compared our results with the legal values of diameter increments, mortality rates, and minimum cutting diameters used to build forest management plans in Cameroon. Diameter increment was found to vary with tree size for most of the species studied. The relationships between diameter increment and tree size were mostly humpback-shaped. The trees with diameters close to or lower than the reference minimum cutting diameter generally grew faster than the average. We also found that tree growth could slow for 1–2 years after timber exploitation and was then spurred for at least 5 years. The tree growth response to logging was nevertheless species-specific.

As deadwood can make up large portions of the total aboveground biomass, it plays an important role in the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle. Nevertheless, in tropical ecosystems and especially in Africa, quantitative studies on this topic remain scarce. We conducted an aboveground deadwood inventory along two environmental gradients—elevation and land use— at Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. We used a huge elevation gradient (3690 m) along the southern slope of the mountain to investigate how deadwood is accumulated across different climate and vegetation zones. We also compared habitats that differed from natural forsts in land-use intensity and disturbance history to assess anthropogenic influence on deadwood accumulation. In our inventory we distinguished coarse woody debris (CWD) from fine woody debris (FWD). Furthermore, we calculated the C and nitrogen (N) content of deadwood and how the C/N ratio varied with decomposition stages and elevation. Total amounts of aboveground deadwood ranged from 0.07 ± 0.04 to 73.78 ± 36.26 Mg ha–1 (Mean ± 1 SE). Across the elevation gradient, total deadwood accumulation was highest at mid-elevations and reached a near-zero minimum at very low and very high altitudes. This unimodal pattern was mainly driven by the corresponding amount of live aboveground biomass and the combined effects of decomposer communities and climate. Land-use conversion from natural forests into traditional homegardens and commercial plantations, in addition to frequent burning, significantly reduced deadwood biomass, but not past selective logging after 30 years of recovery time. Furthermore, we found that deadwood C content increased with altitude. Our study shows that environmental gradients, especially temperature and precipitation, as well as different anthropogenic disturbances can have considerable effects on both the quantity and composition of deadwood in tropical forests.

Data from different remote sensing platforms such as digital aerial photographs generated from unmanned aerial vehicle and satellite images (Planetscope and Worldview) were used to extract forest attributes associated with the logging process. Based on the findings, the major sources of emission were found to be from the construction of logging infrastructure, followed by timber extraction and incidental damage. The estimated emission factor was 1.305 Mg C m-3 when the logging area was logged.

However, the spatial resolution (30 m) of Landsat images has often been considered too coarse to accurately detect the extent and impacts of selective logging. The Sentinel-2 satellite launched in 2015 has been providing images at spatial resolutions of 10 to 20 m and those images have shown an improved potential for detecting forest disturbances in tropical regions. We compared Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery for detecting selective logging in a rain forest site in the Brazilian Amazon. The aerosol-free modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI_af) was retrieved from the satellite images acquired in August 2020 immediately following logging. A robust reference dataset of very-high-resolution imagery (0.5 m) acquired using a complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensor (visible bands) onboard of an unmanned aerial vehicle was used to image the area of interest and a map derived from it was used to assess the classification accuracies made using satellite-derived data. The overall accuracy of the classified Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images varied between 54% and 83%, depending on the applied classification parameters for distinguishing undisturbed from disturbed forest canopy. Images acquired using the UAV allowed us to detect subtle impacts of canopy openings by selective logging activities. Images acquired using the UAV allowed the detection of small canopy openings, but not Sentinel-2 or Landsat-8. Sentinel-2 provided more details of canopy disturbances than Landsat image. Our classification approach is fully implementable on the Google Earth Engine platform and is a promising technique to monitor selective logging impacts in tropical forests. © 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","forest degradation; Landsat-8; selective logging; Sentinel-2; unmanned aerial vehicle","Matricardi, E.A.T.; University of Brasilia, Campus Darcy Ribeiro, Brazil; email: ematricardi@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128243654

Tree diversity in secondary forests may be high, but based on newcomer species of low wood density and long-distance, abiotic dispersal modes. We compiled and analyzed three pairs of case studies (totaling 815 plots and 11.8 ​ha) of secondary forests recovering from logging, fire and conversion to agroforest in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesia) on mineral soils. Data on tree species diversity, wood density frequency distribution (indicative of successional status) and dispersal modes were compared with those of less disturbed comparator forests in the same landscapes. Relatively undisturbed lowland dipterocarp forest in Kalimantan had close to 200 species of trees (>10 ​cm diameter) at a 1-ha sample scale (and 450 ​at a 10-ha scale). After repeated fires a sample area of 2 ​ha was needed to reach the same species richness. Regulation-based logging had little impact on tree species richness. In rubber agroforest with low-intensity management beyond rubber planting, 50 tree species were found at a 1-ha scale and close to 100 species in 3 ​ha. The Kalimantan forest after repeated fires had a markedly higher fraction of low-wood-density trees (40%), but otherwise, all forests sampled were similar in overall wood density profiles. Selectively logged forest managed by a local community (village forest) and rubber agroforest in Sumatra contained larger fractions of heavy-wood-density trees. The majority of trees (50%–70%) had birds, bats and primates as dispersal agents in all sites. Selectively logged forests had higher fractions of autochorous species (15%) compared to other sites. Anemochorous (wind-dispersed) species, especially Macaranga lowii, were most common (20%) in lowland dipterocarp forest. Comparison between secondary forests and agroforests showed the influence of farmer selection regarding what is allowed to grow beyond the pole stage. Wood density and seed dispersal profiles can be used as degradation indicators of species assemblages across various disturbance levels and types, as they reflect the habitat quality of the surrounding landscape mosaics. © 2022 Beijing Forestry University.","Agroforestry; Dipterocarp; Dispersal modes; Kalimantan; Landscape restoration; Natural regeneration; Sumatra; Wood density","van Noordwijk, M.; World Agroforestry (ICRAF)Indonesia; email: m.vannoordwijk@cgiar.org",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127487379

Primary forest set-asides along riparian zones are mandated in many countries and a key question is whether these riparian reserves provide biodiversity conservation benefits. We characterise butterfly communities in fixed-width riparian reserves of 30 m on each bank along narrow streams (<10 m) paired with interior logged forest transects, and in primary forests within a selective logging concession in the south-western Brazilian Amazon. We found that primary forest species richness was more similar to riparian reserves than to paired interior logged forest points, whereas abundance remained higher in both riparian reserves and interior logged points, likely due to the intrusion of canopy-dwelling species in disturbed habitats, as previously reported in the literature. Butterfly assemblages within riparian reserves were more similar to unlogged primary forests than interior logged points, and canopy height in riparian reserves was associated with increased assemblage similarity to primary forest points. Changes in abundance relative to primary forest were of a larger magnitude in interior logged points than in riparian reserves within logged forests, highlighting the role of riparian reserves in maintaining primary forest-like communities. We found no particular primary forest butterfly clades to be more sensitive to changes in abundance than other clades. Synthesis and applications. Mandatory conservation set-asides around streams or rivers (riparian buffers) have an important role in protecting the abundance and composition of primary forest butterfly assemblages within selective logging concessions in tropical rainforests.

Under this hypothesis, seedlings of monodominant species should have limited ability to respond to drastic increases in understory light, like those resulting from logging. Therefore, monodominant species should lose their seedling dominance after logging-induced canopy opening. To test this hypothesis, the current study measured seedling survival and growth of the monodominant species, Prioria copaifera, and its main competitor, Pentaclethra macroloba, in two forest stands that differ in logging history and in an unlogged stand in southeastern Costa Rica. Although, growth rates and survival of previously established seedlings were similar for both species across the three stands, seedling survival and growth decreased as light increased, with the effect being more pronounced for Prioria than for Pentaclethra. The study also investigated the ability of Prioria to respond to changing light environments by transplanting seedlings into logging-induced canopy gaps. Contrary to prediction, Prioria seedlings survived and grew better in gap centers than in gap edges or under a closed canopy. This result contrasts with established seedlings that cannot acclimate to changes in light conditions. Therefore, we conclude that continued Prioria dominance in selectively logged forests depends more on seedling production after canopy disturbance than on the established seedling present before disturbances. © 2022 Forest Research Institute Malaysia.

By sequestering more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem — ~1 Pg C yr−1 — tropical forests provide crucial natural climate solutions and opportunities in the evolving voluntary carbon market. Methods: Here, we argue that some issues with the current sustainable management of tropical forests can be addressed using carbon-focused sustainable forest management (SFM + C) to leverage financial resources for tropical forest carbon storage and sequestration. We suggest an extended harvest cycle in SFM + C and calculate an associated potential increase in aboveground carbon stocks of commercial timber of 1.26 Mg C ha−1 after each cycle in the Brazilian Amazon. Results: The additional carbon storage due to a longer harvest cycle can generate carbon credits worth 152.6 (SD 9.2) US dollars per hectare in 40 years. Considering an average cost of 180 BRL per m3 of commercial timber delivered to the sawmill, an SFM + C plan with a 40-year cycle could generate 28.7% (SD 2.5) more profit than 35-year cycles by combining timber and carbon revenues. Conclusion: A robust carbon price could incentivize the further extension of harvest cycles, providing a monetary return that offsets the opportunity cost intrinsic to harvesting under longer cycles. Finally, we highlight research needs to support tropical SFM + C, which can be part of a global collective effort to limit global warming to below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Amazon forests; Climate change; Forest carbon stock; Natural climate solutions; Reduced-impact logging","Bomfim, B.; Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division, United States; email: bbomfim@lbl.gov",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122961418

Yet, rapidly growing populations are driving continued degradation of tropical forests to supply wood products. The United Nations (UN) has developed the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) programme to mitigate climate impacts and biodiversity losses through improved forest management. Consistent and reliable systems are still needed to monitor tropical forests at large scales, however, degradation has largely been left out of most REDD+ reporting given the lack of effective monitoring and countries mainly focus on deforestation. Recent advances in combining optical data and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have shown promise for improved ability to monitor forest losses, but it remains unclear if similar improvements could be made in detecting and mapping forest degradation. We used detailed selective logging records from three lowland tropical forest regions in the Brazilian Amazon to test the effectiveness of combining Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 for selective logging detection. We built Random Forest models to classify pixelbased differences in logged and unlogged regions to understand if combining optical and SAR improved the detection capabilities over optical data alone. We found that the classification accuracy of models utilizing optical data from Landsat 8 alone were slightly higher than models that combined Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8. In general, detection of selective logging was high with both optical only and optical-SAR combined models, but our results show that the optical data was dominating the predictive performance and adding SAR data introduced noise, lowering the detection of selective logging. While we have shown limited capabilities with C-band SAR, the anticipated opening of the ALOS-PALSAR archives and the anticipated launch of NISAR and BIOMASS in 2023 should stimulate research investigating similar methods to understand if longer wavelength SAR might improve classification of areas affected by selective logging when combined with optical data. © 2021 by the authors.","Brazil; Degradation; Forest disturbance; Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM); Optical; Random forest; Reduced-impact logging; Satellite; Synthetic aperture radar; Tropical forest","Hethcoat, M.G.; Environmental Dynamics Group, United Kingdom; email: m.hethcoat@sheffield.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122814001

Tropical forests are one of the most at-risk habitats and many tropical species have become extinct recently due to human activity. It is imperative to monitor habitat in protected areas and without in order to identify strategies and legislative policies that optimize conservation outcomes. To this end, I quantified habitat fragmentation for the great hornbill (Buceros bicornis) in Om Koi Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, pre- and post-establishment, within and outside the protected area, from 1973, 1985, and 1992, to assess the effectiveness of the protected area status, established in 1978, and a national logging ban, established in 1989, in preserving and restoring hornbill habitat. The results demonstrate that the establishment of Om Koi Wildlife Sanctuary did not decrease the rate of hornbill habitat fragmentation relative to areas outside the protected area. While the protected area had less fragmentation to begin with, protection status did not affect the rate of loss. Fragmentation increased significantly both inside and outside the protected area between the first and second time points (p < 0.05), after the protected area was first established. However, the national logging ban policy implemented in 1985 seems to have successfully halted the fragmentation of habitat within the protected area and surrounding unprotected areas, with all areas showing no significant change (p > 0.05). While not significant, the rate of fragmentation outside the protected area was greater. This suggests that the establishment of a protected area alone may not be sufficient to stop or reverse anthropogenic damage to endangered habitat and the species that utilize these environments. The incorporation of multiple strategies for management is likely needed to increase the ability of protected areas to preserve tropical forest species and habitats. The assessment of protected areas via satellite and ground-level data is an essential tool for evaluating the effectiveness of conservation strategies and improving outcomes. © The Author(s), 2022.

We sampled 33 one-ha forest plots scattered in a protected area, in a logging concession and in community forests. Within each plot, we inventoried the seed bank in the litter and in four successive soil layers of 5 cm depth interval, and the standing vegetation. Seed density significantly varied with sampling depth but not between land use types. A total of 181 morphospecies were identified. Trees species accounted for 46% of seeds with pioneer species dispersed by animals dominating the seed bank. Species diversity and composition strongly varied with the sampling depth; the litter seed bank was more similar in composition to the soil seed bank than to the seedling bank, sapling, and forest stands. We highlighted the presence of a dense and diverse seed bank in each land use type. We also showed the differentiation of each sampling depth in terms of species composition, thus revealing their complementarity in the dynamics of natural regeneration.

The activation of an immune response to fight off infections requires energy and other resources such as antioxidants which may be redirected from growth and reproduction. A key question is how selective logging—the most common form of tropical forest degradation—impacts the prevalence of avian haemosporidian infection and its correlated physiological responses (nutritional and oxidative status markers). We investigated the prevalence of Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, and Leucocytozoon parasites in 14 understorey bird species in lowland, logged and unlogged, old-growth forests of Borneo. Prevalences of infections were similar between selectively logged and unlogged forests. To explore nutritional and oxidative status effects of haemosporidian infections, we examined associations between infections and plasma proteins, plasma triglycerides, and multiple blood-based markers of oxidative status, testing for an impact of selective logging on those markers. Birds infected with Plasmodium showed higher levels of plasma proteins and non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity, and lower levels of plasma triglycerides and glutathione, compared with haemosporidian-free individuals. Conversely, birds infected with Haemoproteus showed no changes in nutritional or physiological markers compared with uninfected individuals. These results indicate higher metabolic and physiological costs of controlling Plasmodium infection, compared with Haemoproteus, possibly due to higher pathogenicity of Plasmodium. Selectively logged forests had no effect on the responses of birds to infection, suggesting that the environmental conditions of degraded forests do not appear to induce any appreciable physiological demands in parasitised birds. © 2021 Australian Society for Parasitology","Avian haemosporidian; Blood parasite; Forest disturbance; Nutrition; Oxidative status; Selective logging","Messina, S.; Behavioural Ecology & Ecophysiology Group, Universiteitsplein 1, Belgium; email: simone.messina@uantwerpen.be",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114483012

This study therefore aims to explore how varying site conditions, resulting from the creation of different disturbance types (skid trails and felling gaps) following selective logging at two logging intensities influenced long-term floristic composition eighteen years after logging. The study was conducted in the permanent sample plots located in a 134-ha compartment in the Pra-Anum Forest Reserve. Data collection was conducted on 160 recording plots distributed on three disturbance sites and an unlogged area, within two blocks of logging intensity of 26.32 m3/ha and 52.63 m3/ha (representing the volume of trees harvested per hectare). Results showed that the main skid trail had significantly lower species abundance and richness than the other disturbance types and the unlogged area. There was also a significant difference in species spatial distribution across all the four sites. These distribution patterns revealed differences in plant dominance at disturbance gradients, which indicate their success at competing for available resources within their niche space. Furthermore, the number of species belonging to particular ecological guilds classified from the different skid trails and unlogged areas as well logging intensities showed no significant variation. However, most of the species sampled across the disturbance regimes and unlogged area were observed to be shade tolerant. Logging disturbance and logging intensity did not influence the distribution of trees of national conservation importance (based on tree distribution, ecology, local abundance, interaction with ecosystem parameters and economic importance which have been used as basis conservation prioritization). However, disturbance type and higher logging intensities favoured tree species of minimal timber and national conservation importance, relative to the unlogged area. Given the increasing demand for timber products for both domestic and international markets, which is driving higher harvesting intensities legally and illegally, this study will inform forest management decision making on the long term dynamics of tree species recovery following logging. © 2021 The Author(s)","Forest management; Logging; Logging impact; Regeneration; Tropical forest","Antobre, O.O.; Faculty of Renewable Natural Resources, Private Mail Bag UPO, Ghana; email: ooantobre.canr@knust.edu.gh",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122626427

Degradation, in particular those caused by selective logging, result in features whose detection is a challenge to remote sensing, due to its size, space configuration, and geographical distribution. From the available remote sensing technologies, SAR data allow monitoring even during adverse atmospheric conditions. The aim of this study was to test different pre-trained models of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for change detection associated with forest degradation in bitemporal products obtained from a pair of SAR COSMO-SkyMed images acquired before and after logging in the Jamari National Forest. This area contains areas of legal and illegal logging, and to test the influence of the speckle effect on the result of this classification by applying the classification methodology on previously filtered and unfiltered images, comparing the results. A method of cluster detections was also presented, based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), which would make it possible, for example, to guide inspection actions and allow the calculation of the intensity of exploitation (IEX). Although the differences between the tested models were in the order of less than 5%, the tests on the RGB composition (where R = coefficient of variation; G = minimum values; and B = gradient) presented a slightly better performance compared to the others in terms of the number of correct classifications for selective logging, in particular using the model Painters (accuracy = 92%) even in the generalization tests, which presented an overall accuracy of 87%, and in the test on RGB from the unfiltered image pair (accuracy of 90%). These results indicate that multitemporal X-band SAR data have the potential for monitoring selective logging in tropical forests, especially in combination with CNN techniques. © 2021 by the authors.

The same applies to managed areas of the Amazon forest. We explore a method of sustainable forest management (SFM) which anticipates the result of processes of natural mortality of large, mature trees that could fall and damage their neighbors. Collecting all the information required for planning logging in the Brazilian Amazon is, currently, a hard, time-consuming and expensive task. (2) Methods: This information can be obtained more quickly, accurately and objectively by including airborne laser scanning (ALS) products in the operational plan. We used ALS point clouds to isolate emergent crowns from the canopy height model. Then, we performed field work to validate the existence of these trees, and to understand how many commercial trees (tree diameter ≥ 50 cm) we identified by orienting the trees search through the emergent canopy model. (3) Results: We were able to detect 184 (54.4%) trees from 338 field-recorded individuals in 20 plots (totaling 8 ha). Of the detected trees, 66 individuals were classified as having potential for commerce. Furthermore, 58 individuals presented the best stem quality for logging, which represents more than seven high quality commercial trees per hectare. The logistic regression showed that the effects that positively influence the emergent crown formation are strongly presented in the commercial species. (4) Conclusions: Using airborne laser scanning can improve the SFM planning in a structurally complex, dense and mixed composition tropical forest by reducing field work in the initial stages of management. Therefore, we propose that ALS operational planning can be used to more efficiently direct field surveys without the need for a full census. © 2021 by the authors.

The discrimination of tree species for economic, ecological, and technical reasons is usually necessary for achieving promising results in tree species mapping. Most of the data used in tree species mapping normally have some degree of imbalance. This study aimed to assess the effects of imbalanced data in identifying and mapping trees species under threat in a selectively logged sub‐montane heterogeneous tropical forest using random forest (RF) and support vector machine with radial basis function (RBF‐SVM) kernel classifiers and WorldView‐2 multispectral imagery. For comparison purposes, the original imbalanced dataset was standardized using three data sampling techniques: oversampling, undersampling, and combined oversampling and undersampling techniques in R. The combined oversampling and undersampling technique produced the best results: F1‐scores of 68.56 ± 2.6% for RF and 64.64 ± 3.4% for SVM. The balanced dataset recorded improved classification accuracy compared to the original imbalanced dataset. This research observed that more separable classes recorded higher F1‐scores. Among the species, Syzygium guineense and Zanthoxylum gilletii were the most accurately mapped whereas Newtonia buchananii was the least accurately mapped. The most important spectral bands with the ability to detect and distinguish between tree species as measured by random forest classifier, were the Red, Red Edge, Near Infrared 1, and Near Infrared 2. © 2021 by the authors.

Movement is a vital mechanistic process underpinning demographic, ecological, and evolutionary processes that likely determine species responses to logging. We assessed how tropical selective logging impacts local movements of 71 understory avian species in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, and determined whether movement patterns relate to species' conservation status, functional traits, sensitivity to logging and trophic position. We used a capture-mark-recapture methodology and a hierarchical Bayesian framework to model maximum observed local movement distances, accounting for spatial sampling heterogeneity. Across the avian community, we found a higher probability of moving shorter distances (up to 200 m) in logged forests, and higher movement probability at longer distances (above 200 m) in unlogged forests. Altered movement patterns after logging may reflect increased understory density, changed resource distribution and/or predation risks, and suggest smaller home-range sizes. Species' conservation status, body mass, foraging guild, logging sensitivity and trophic position were unrelated to the magnitude of movement change. The continued persistence of understory species in our sample after selective logging may depend on flexibility in movement behaviour, conferring resilience to habitat degradation and the retention of high conservation values. This lends further support for the protection of these logged forests for biodiversity conservation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Birds; Joint species modelling; Movement ecology; Production forest; Southeast Asia; Sustainable forest management","Cosset, C.C.P.; Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, United Kingdom; email: ccpcosset@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118509373

About 90% of the piedmont forest in the Southern Andean Yungas has been converted to other land-use types and the remaining forests fragments are being intensively logged without management plans. Bird species, especially understory birds, are good indicators of forest diversity and integrity. The aim of this study was to identify understory bird species associated with changes in the forest structure caused by selective logging and to explore whether it is possible to use these species as a monitoring tool. We observed that Sittasomus griseicapillus, Turdus rufiventris, Lepidocolaptes angustirostris, Casiornis rufus, Thraupis sayaca, and Tolmomyias sulphurescens were associated to unlogged sites with higher density of timber-yielding and standing dead trees. Thamnophilus caerulescens, Leptotila megalura, Synallaxis scutata, Poecilotriccus plumbeiceps, and Catharus ustulatus were favoured by logging activities and associated with understory visual obstruction. Mean cut-off abundance thresholds were 2.74 ind/ha for the avian guild associated with unlogged forest and 1.79 ind/ha for the guild associated with logged forest. Sustainable forest management schemes need to retain the understory visual obstruction at values similar to those of unlogged forest (43.75%), together with an adequate density (≥10 ind/ha) of standing dead trees with at least 19.5 cm in DBH, and a minimum of 210 ind/ha of timber tree species.

This study analyzes the responses of the EMF community in managed tropical montane forests in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas. EMF community composition and diversity were evaluated over a 2-year period along a gradient of structural and microclimatic conditions of the forest associated with the stages of a cycle of silvicultural practices (R = release cutting, T = thinning, and F = final regeneration cutting), as well as in a mid-successional unmanaged forest (UF) as a reference system. The silvicultural practices involve varying intensities of tree harvesting (≈ 20% in T to ≈ 80% in F). It is hypothesized that: (1) diversity and composition of EMF communities are influenced by changes in forest conditions, principally as a result of canopy cover alteration due to forest management, and (2) late forest successional conditions are associated to more diverse EMF communities, while more intensive silvicultural practices reduce their diversity. A total of 75 EMF species were recorded. Diversity analysis using Hill numbers showed a close relationship between diversity and forest conditions: total species richness, 0D = 5.7 ± 0.6 in F up to 11.7 ± 1.3 in UF; richness of abundant species, 1D = 4.1 ± 0.4 in F up to 7.5 ± 0.4 in UF; richness of very abundant species 2D = 3.3 ± 0.3 in R up to 5.5 ± 0.3 in UF. Canopy cover (9.8 ± 4% in F and 80.6 ± 5% in UF) was the main factor affecting EMF diversity, mainly due to its influence on herbaceous cover, tree species richness (path analysis, R2 = 0.32; p &lt; 0.05), and microclimatic variables. Turnover of the most abundant EMF species from the most intensive management practice towards the later successional forest conditions was observed. Late successional conditions allow for maintenance of more diverse EMF communities, while more intensive practices reduce their diversity (p &lt; 0.05, in both cases). Rare fungal species appear to be more vulnerable to highly intensive management, and account for most of the EMF diversity in UF. The results indicate the importance of preserving relatively undisturbed species-rich forest stands near intensively managed stands in order to maintain biological integrity of the EMF community and ecosystem functioning in tropical montane forests. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropogenic disturbance; Canopy cover; Cloud forests; Fungal community diversity; Timber harvesting","González-Espinosa, M.; Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, Carretera Panamericana y Periférico Sur s/n, Barrio de María Auxiliadora, Mexico; email: mgonzale@ecosur.mx",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114736548

Land-use change has an impact on downstream aquatic processes, but those impacts have mainly been studied in temperate climate regions. The present article reviews the impacts of various tropical land-use changes caused by human activities on downstream riverine and estuarine water properties and biogeochemical cycles, focusing especially on the behaviors of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Logging of tropical primary forests, subsequent establishment of pasture lands, and occasional wildfire or intentional burning have decreased terrestrial N fixation and increased the discharge of P combined with soils, which has lowered the N:P ratio of dissolved inorganic nutrients in the adjacent stream waters and downstream rivers. Agricultural fertilizers and aquacultural practices basically cause nutrient enrichment in downstream riverine and estuarine waters, changing the N:P ratio depending on the source. Finally, urbanization causes eutrophication in many tropical estuaries, where a halocline forms easily because of a warm temperature throughout the year and the water at the bottom of the estuary tends to become hypoxic or anoxic. Overall, the impact of land-use change on aquatic processes may be more serious in tropical regions than in temperate or cold climate regions because of (1) a higher biomass and nutrient stock in original tropical forests; (2) higher precipitation, more frequent episodic flooding, and warmer temperatures in tropical regions; and (3) certain practices that are rapidly expanding in tropical regions such as land-based aquaculture. Various land-use changes are causing downstream nutrient enrichment or disturbance of the nutrient balance at tropical land-sea interfaces, and the overall N:P ratios in the aquatic ecosystem seem to be declining. Nonetheless, if proper management is conducted and the discharge of nutrients and soils ceases, tropical aquatic systems may have the potential to recover faster than those in other climate regions because of their abundant precipitation and warm temperature. Long-term monitoring and more attention to elemental stoichiometry are important areas for future research. © 2021, The Author(s).","Aquatic conservation; Deforestation; Environmental monitoring; Eutrophication; Hypoxia; Land-use change; Water quality; Water resources","Tanaka, Y.; Environmental and Life Sciences, Jalan Tungku Link, Brunei Darussalam; email: yasuaki.tanaka@ubd.edu.bn",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107395227

Floristic inventory could provide essential information for forest conservation but species identification as a part of inventory creating could be challenging in some cases. Barcode DNA coupled with High Resolution Melting analysis (Bar-HRM) was used here in aiding species identification of plant in Dipterocarpaceae (Dipterocarpus alatus, D. costatu, D. intricatus, D. obtusifolius, Hopea ferrea, H. odorata, Shorea guiso, S. obtuse, S. roxburghii, and S. siamensis) and Fagaceae (Castanopsis echinocarpa, C. inermis, Lithocarpus wallichianus, Quercus aliena and Q. oidocarpa) families. Two main experiments were conducted including: (1) a comparing method for primer design and (2) testing the robustness of the Bar-HRM by trying to identify tree samples that did not have sequences in the GenBank. In experiment 1, the manual design primer pair was found to be the best fit for the work. Of key importance is finding the primers which give the most nucleotide variations within the generated amplicon; this is a parameter that cannot be set in any web-based tools. Next, in experiment 2, Bar-HRM using primers of ITS1 and ITS2 regions were able to discriminate all 10 tested tree species without any problem, even when there were no sequences of the samples to be analysed before performing the HRM. Here, Bar-HRM poses potential to be a game-changer in tropical forest conservation, as it will be useful for species identification. © 2021 by the authors.

Two competing harvest management strategies have been proposed: Land sharing via low-intensity logging throughout a concession; and high-intensity land-sparing logging across a smaller area, protecting part of the concession as primary forest. Empirical research points to land sparing being more optimal for maintaining biodiversity and carbon, especially under secure land tenure, but a key question for forest-based economies is how each strategy affects the profitability of logging. We combine detailed financial data with harvest simulations to assess the profitability of land-sharing and land-sparing logging in the Brazilian Amazon. Under business-as-usual, land-sharing is significantly more profitable than land-sparing logging, whether sparing is conducted in a single block or targeting the highest-density timber stocks, highlighting a conflict between economic and conservation priorities. Land-sharing logging is also more profitable than hybrid strategies whereby a mix of land-sharing and land-sparing logging is employed. Conservation-based restrictions that apply quotas on species in different size classes reduces the opportunity cost of land sparing, but even under tight restrictions land sharing remains more profitable and land sparing often returns a loss. Additional financial incentives, including timber certification schemes and carbon-based payment for ecosystem services, are needed to bridge the opportunity cost of land-sparing logging and minimise ecological damage to tropical rainforests. © 2021 The Author(s).

The maintenance of these forests standing and the recovery of their productivity play an important role in the conservation of biodiversity, storage and carbon sequestration. However, the management techniques currently employed are designed for natural forests in the first harvest cycle or lightly explored and do not apply adequately to forests that have gone through several harvest cycles. Therefore, adaptations and the establishment of new management criteria that take into account other characteristics of these types of forests are necessary to ensure their sustainability. The objective of this study was to propose a silvicultural management system that has the potential to recover and perpetuate the productivity of an intensively logged tropical forest. A forest census was carried out on 535.6 ha for trees with dbh ≥ 25 cm. With these data, the following two treatments were designed: (1) criteria: the BDq method was applied from B = 9.8 m2 ha−1, D = 100 cm and q = 2. The criteria for standing wood commercialization were, in this order, first, Health; second, Tree Stem; third, Tree Density and fourth, dbh ≥ 105 cm. (2) Control: the planning was in accordance with Brazilian regulations. For the cost–benefit and sensitivity analysis, the Net Present Value (NPV) was used and a projection of ±20% was made in the commercial price of standing wood. In the criteria treatment, a higher number of trees and species destined for the commercialization of standing wood was verified in relation to the control treatment, showing a greater diversity of species. In the criteria treatment, NPV was positive and superior to the control treatment in all scenarios. The proposed silvicultural management system with an object of an explored and enriched forest, with criteria for harvesting trees with a minimum cut diameter of 25 cm, proved to be viable to generate economic returns and with conservationist potential for the continuous supply of forest products and maintaining biodiversity. © 2021 by the authors.

Much research has addressed the impact of degradation on species diversity; however, little is known about how ecological interactions are altered, including those that constitute important ecosystem functions such as consumption of herbivores. To examine how rainforest degradation alters trophic interaction networks, we applied DNA metabarcoding to construct interaction networks linking forest-dwelling insectivorous bat species and their prey, comparing old-growth forest and forest degraded by logging in Sabah, Borneo. Individual bats in logged rainforest consumed a lower richness of prey than those in old-growth forest. As a result, interaction networks in logged forests had a less nested structure. These network structures were associated with reduced network redundancy and thus increased vulnerability to perturbations in logged forests. Our results show how ecological interactions change between old-growth and logged forests, with potentially negative implications for ecosystem function and network stability. © 2021 The Authors.

Multiple disturbances often occur simultaneously in forests. Hunting and logging, for example, are within-forest disturbances that impact vast areas of seemingly intact rainforests. Despite recent work on the individual effects of these disturbances, our understanding of how they interact to influence tree communities is still limited. In northern Republic of Congo, we explored the effects of hunting and logging on tree communities. Over an 8-year period, we monitored 12,552 tree stems (≥10 cm diameter-at-breast height) spread over 30 1-ha plots along a gradient of human disturbance to compare the tree diversity between hunted and logged forest, once-logged forest, and protected forest free of both disturbances. Tree density, species richness, and community composition were affected by both hunting and logging. Forest close to human settlements was richer, more heterogenous, and more dynamic in species composition across censuses. In hunted and logged forest, fast-growing secondary species with low shade tolerance replaced old growth species. Comparatively, the once-logged forest had the greatest stem density and intermediate species richness with an increased density of shade-bearing species over time. Both tree species spatial turnover and tree recruitment were greatly affected by proximity to human settlements. A shift towards abiotically dispersed trees and increasing seed predation by rodents near villages can partly explain the differences in tree recruitment across the forest types. The combination of hunting and logging seems to have a greater impact on tree communities than either single disturbance, especially with nearness to villages. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Afrotropical rainforests; Anthropogenic disturbances; Defaunation; Forest dynamic; Tree assemblages; Tree recruitment","Poulsen, J.R.; Nicholas School of the Environment, P.O.

These forests are rated amidst the most productive natural ecosystems on the earth, and are ecologically and socioeconomically important because of their crucial roles in coastal ecosystem protection. However, these forests are declining at an alarming rate, which is possibly more rapid than that of inland tropical forests. This serious loss has prompted a worldwide movement to protect and promote the sustainable use of mangrove forests. Recently, many governments adopted the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs present an opportunity for nations to set realistic targets for achieving sustainable use of natural resources and environmental capital. Relevant to mangrove conservation, a range of targets were established for implementation by the year 2020, including Targets 6.6, 14.2, 14.5, and 15.2. To date, mangrove forests have been protected and restored for decades in China. However, little is known about achievements of China's SDGs implementation on mangrove forests. The issue highlighted the need for a long-term holistic view of China's mangrove forests dynamics. Although there have been multiple national datasets of China's mangrove forests, few studies focused specifically on mangrove forests and their surrounding land covers. Thus, the objectives of this study are: (1) to apply a systematic remote sensing method across the entire coast of China, and build a new dataset of long-term China's mangrove forests and surrounding land covers in 1973, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015 (the first year of SDGs), and 2020 (the complete year of mangrove related SDGs); (2) to quantify the spatial-temporal changes of mangrove forests and conversion between mangrove forests and other coastal land covers; and (3) to discuss the achievements of China's SDGs implementation on mangrove forests. In this study, we applied a hybrid object-based and hierarchical classification method to Landsat series imagery and achieved a high accuracy dataset of China's mangrove forests and surrounding land covers. Results showed that: (1) on national scale, area of mangrove forests declined from 48801 to 18602 ha between 1973 and 2000, then partially recovered to 28010 ha in 2020; (2) the lost mangrove forests were mainly changed to croplands and aquaculture ponds, while the restored mangrove forests were mainly converted from tidal flats; and (3) during 2015-2020, China government restored 25% of national mangrove forests. To Sep. 2020, the area of mangrove nature reserves accounted for 16% of mangrove growth zone, and 77% of China's mangrove forests grew inside these nature reserves. A batch of relevant laws and regulations has been formulated to prohibit mangrove forests destruction. The protection and restoration of mangrove forests in China have already met Targets 6.6, 14.2, 14.5, and 15.2. However, since illegal logging is strictly prohibited and the awareness of protecting mangrove ecosystem has been increased continuously, losses of mangrove forests in some areas were mainly caused by natural disasters, such as extremely low temperature, hurricane, biological invasions, and insect outbreaks. For example, according to the Guangxi Mangrove Research Center, in March 2008 numbers of Avicennia plants along the coasts of Guangxi were killed by extremely low temperature, and in Guangxi Shankou Mangrove Nature Reserve, more than 167 ha of Spartina alterniflora (an invasive species) were discovered in 2005. The classification method and datasets of this study can support the evaluation of SDG 6.6 implementation, and provide important information for SDGs 13, 14, and 15 evaluation. In addition, the results of this study can serve as an important scientific basis and fundamental data for formulating China's mangrove protection and restoration strategies. © 2021, Science Press.

Furthermore, whether and how the microbial shifts affect vegetation composition and diversity during recovery of post-logged forests remain elusive. Using a spatial grid experiment design in a primary tropical forest intermixed with post-logged patches naturally recovered for half century in Hainan Island, China, we characterized and explained the distance–decay relationships of soil microbial similarities in primary, selectively logged and clear-cut forests. Selectively logged sites showed a lower spatial turnover rate of bacterial assemblages based on phylogenetic and taxonomic β-diversity, but a higher spatial turnover rate of fungal assemblages based on phylogenetic β-diversity, suggesting a higher level of phylogenetic variability in fungal composition. Clear-cut sites showed lower spatial turnover for both bacterial and fungal assemblages based on the two β-diversity, indicating community homogenization. Main drivers of microbial assemblages shifted from soil properties in primary forest to tree composition in selectively logged sites, whereas microbial–tree associations declined in clear-cut sites, leading to stochastically organized microbial assemblages. Synthesis and applications. The increased fungal phylogenetic turnover with tree turnover following selective logging promotes unassisted recovery of plant diversity. In contrast, the decoupling of tree and microbial turnover following clear-cutting suggests restoration approaches based on tree planting, and tree species that have strong associations with bulk soil microbial community should be considered. Our findings advance the understanding of spatial patterns, processes and drivers of soil microbial assemblages in parallel with tree community recovery during regeneration of post-logged tropical forests, and highlight the importance of coupling assemblage patterns between tree and soil fungal communities for conserving tropical forest biodiversity. © 2021 British Ecological Society","biodiversity conservation; community assembly process; forest management; microbial–tree association; soil microbiome; tropical forest; β-diversity","Xu, H.; Research Institute of Tropical Forestry, China; email: hanxu81@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111151630

Improved practices, such as reduced-impact logging (RIL), and alternative timber production strategies (e.g. plantations) can drastically change the overall carbon impact of the wood production sector. Assessing the carbon balance of timber production is crucial but highly dependent on methodological approaches, especially regarding system boundaries and temporality. We developed a temporally-explicit and territory scale model of carbon balance calibrated with long-term local data using Bayesian inference. The model accounts for carbon fluxes from selective logging in natural forest, timber plantation, first transformation and avoided emissions through energy substitution. We used it to compare prospective scenarios of development for the wood sector in French Guiana. Results show that intensification of practices, through increased logging intensity conducted with RIL and establishment of timber plantations, are promising development strategies to reduce the carbon emissions of the French-Guianese wood sector, as well as the area needed for wood production and hence the pressure on natural forests. By reducing logging damage by nearly 50%, RIL allows increasing logging intensity in natural forest from 20 m3 ha−1 to 30 m3 ha−1 without affecting the carbon balance. The use of logging byproducts as fuelwood also improved the carbon balance of selective logging, when substituted to fossil fuel. Allocating less than 30 000 ha to plantation would allow producing 200 000 m3 of timber annually, while the same production in natural forest would imply logging more than 400 000 ha over 60 years. Timber plantation should be preferentially established on non-forested lands, as converting natural forests to plantation leads to high carbon emission peak over the first three decades. We recommend a mixed-strategy combining selective logging in natural forests and plantations as a way to improve long-term carbon balance while reducing short-term emissions. This strategy can reduce the pressure on natural forests while mitigating the risks of changing practices and allowing a diversified source of timber for a diversity of uses. It requires adaptation of the wood sector and development of technical guidelines. Research and monitoring efforts are also needed to assess the impacts of changing practices on other ecosystem services, especially biodiversity conservation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian modelling; French Guiana; Land-sparing strategy; Reduced-impact logging; Selective logging; Timber plantation","Derroire, G.; Cirad, Campus Agronomique, French Guiana; email: geraldine.derroire@cirad.fr",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110594638

Their mitigation potential is, however, affected by significant greenhouse gas emissions through tropical deforestation or forest degradation. Mitigating degradation caused by conventional logging is therefore an important challenge for silvicultural management, and various reduced impact logging techniques seek to reduce biomass loss and other logging impacts during forest logging activities. Little knowledge exists about the potential of sustainable management for maintaining and restoring the climate change mitigation capacity of tropical forests. Our research contributes to knowledge about this potential, as our aim is to evaluate the above-ground biomass (AGB) stock of tropical forests managed for sustainable timber production and compare it with that of intact primary forests. We also determine the environmental and spatial factors that influence AGB. We estimated the AGB of 141 permanent sampling plots in Costa Rican tropical forests (71 plots set up in areas managed for timber production forests and 70 plots set up in areas with intact primary forests) using data for the 2000–2015 period. We compared the AGB of timber production forests with that of primary forest using linear mixed models and examined the relationship between forest AGB and climate, soil fertility and spatial variables (PCNM eigenvalues) using variation partitioning (VARPART) and multiple linear regression in the mixed model framework. Mean AGB was higher in forest plots set up in areas managed for timber production than in plots set up in areas with intact primary forests. In VARPART, spatial variables had the strongest effect on AGB with a small but significant effect of soil fertility. Regression showed potassium levels in the soil to be positively related to AGB. There was no significant effect of climate, probably because of the short temperature and precipitation gradients. Sustainable forest management in these Costa Rican forests managed for timber production has enabled them to store as much carbon in biomass as primary forests, due to the low intensity logging and sustainability criteria stipulated by the country's forestry legislation. As a result, sustainable forest management, in addition to providing a sustainable timber ecosystem service, is also a natural climate solution, maintaining the mitigation potential of Costa Rica's tropical forests in the current climate context. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change mitigation; Permanent sampling plots; Plot spatial distribution; Primary forests; Sustainable forest management; Variation partitioning","Ngo Bieng, M.A.; CATIE – Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y EnseñanzaCosta Rica; email: marie-ange.ngo_bieng@cirad.fr",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109157058

This study assessed carbon emission reductions through the improved forest management and the substitution of fossil fuels with wood biomasses under the conventional (CVL) and reduced impact logging (RIL) systems in Southeast Asia between 2000 and 2060. During this period, carbon emissions from logging and deforestation in the region were approximately 10% of carbon emissions from tropical deforestation. By adopting the RIL, 96.6 Tg CO2 of emissions can be reduced, while producing 35.1 million m3 year−1 of wood products.

However, the pathways through which diffuse disturbance is acting on the forest are little understood. This information is especially demanded in the case of vanishing Neotropical seasonally dry forests such as the Tumbesian ones. We proposed a conceptual model to analyze the factors behind the loss of woody species richness along a forest disturbance gradient, explicitly considering the existence of direct and indirect causal pathways of biodiversity loss. We hypothesized that the chronic disturbance can act on the woody species richness directly, either by selective extraction of resources or by browsing of palatable species for livestock, or indirectly, by modifying characteristics of the forest structure and productivity. To test our model, we sampled forest remnants in a very extensive area submitted to long standing chronic pressure. Our forests cells (200 × 200 m) were characterized both in terms of woody species composition, structure, and human pressure. Our structural equation models (SEMs) showed that chronic disturbance is driving a loss of species richness. This was done mainly by indirect effects through the reduction of large trees density. We assume that changes in tree density modify the environmental conditions, thus increasing the stress and finally filtering some specific species. The analysis of both, direct and indirect, allows us to gain a better understanding of the processes behind plant species loss in this SDTF. © Copyright © 2021 Jara-Guerrero, González-Sánchez, Escudero and Espinosa.","chronic disturbance; disturbance gradient; forest degradation; seasonally dry tropical forest; selective logging; structural complexity; Tumbesian region; woody species richness","Espinosa, C.I.; Departamento de Ciencias Biológicas, Ecuador; email: ciespinosa@utpl.edu.ec",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117138611

Such legislation provides for a cutting cycle that can vary from 25 to 35 years and a minimum cutting diameter of 50 cm. In view of the above, the present research aimed to evaluate the accuracy of regression models for the projection of growth in diameter and to calculate the t by diametric class for trees of the species C. guianensis and T. altíssima. Four models with fixed effects were tested and best model was selected as the base model for the incorporation of random effects. The best fixed-effect model was Pienaar and Schiver. Thus, structures of variance and autocorrelation were added to this model to correct heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. Finally, the time of passage for each species studied was calculated. The average annual increment in diameter estimated with the Pienaar and Schiver model with fixed effect was 0.38 cm.year−1 for C. guianensis and 0.46 cm.year−1 for T. altissima. Using the Pienaar and Schiver model with a random effect, the average annual diameter increase varied from 0.31 to 0.58 cm.year−1 for C. guianensis and from 0.37 to 0.65 mm.year−1 for T. altissima. Results showed that the estimated cutting cycle varied from 24 to 45 years for the species C. guianensis and from 21 to 38 years for the species T. altissima. Thus, using the cutting time of 25 to 35 years and a minimum cutting diameter of 50 cm for these species, can lead to incorrect decisions about the intensity of logging or the appropriate length of the cutting cycle. The growth and production models depict a synthesis of the growth dynamics of the forest, allowing to providing fundamental information for the definition of planning strategies, such as the establishment of a cutting cycle and an exploration intensity more compatible with the growth rate of the forest and for each species. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Forest management; Regression models; Sustainability; Tropical forest","Silva, J.P.M.; Federal University of Espirito Santo/UFES, Avenue Governor Lindemberg; 316, Brazil; email: jefersonsb09@hotmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111562522

The IFMS has promoted selective logging for timber harvesting and intensive line planting to enrich the standing stock. The implementation of the IFMS has reduced the forest canopy cover, disturbed the surface soil, changed the soil hydraulic properties, and increased direct runoff and soil erosion. Investigation of the IFMS impact on soil hydraulic properties and the generation of surface runoff using a saturated hydraulic conductivity model is needed. Soil hydraulic properties were investigated on 11 plots, including one virgin forest plot and 10 plots at different operational periods of the IFMS. A two-dimensional saturated soil water flow simulation was applied to generate surface runoff from different periods of the IFMS. The main parameters of canopy cover, net rainfall, and saturated hydraulic conductivity were used in the simulations. A simulation scenario of a surface runoff hydrograph in different forest operations was used to analyze the river buffer effectiveness. The results showed that fundamental IFMS activities associated with mechanized selective logging and intensive line planting have reduced the soil hydraulic conductivity within the near-surface profile. The recovery time for near-surface Ks on non-skidder tracks was between 10 and 15 years, whereas on the skidder tracks it was more than 20 years. Forest disturbances have altered the typical surface hydrological pathways, thereby creating the conditions for more surface runoff on disturbed surfaces than on undisturbed surfaces. Maintaining the buffer area is an effective means to reduce the peak discharge and surface runoff in the stream channel. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, it is important to examine how logging affects biodiversity on a landscape scale to plan responsible management of a tropical forest. Although a number of plot-based studies have shown the effect of logging on local tree species richness (alpha diversity), the effect on species turnover along environmental gradients (beta diversity) remains largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated how logging disturbance affects alpha and beta diversity along an elevational gradient on the eastern slope of Mount Trus Madi in Borneo. We further investigated how pioneer and late-successional tree species differed in the habitat range to clarify the mechanism underlying the beta diversity pattern. We selected 90 plots, each with a radius of 20 m, with a range of disturbance intensity (five classes from highly degraded forests to pristine forests) in lower (285–600 m asl) and higher elevation areas (600–1105 m asl). The remaining above-ground biomass, which is an indicator of past disturbance intensity, strongly varied across the plots (5.4–570.6 and 3.1–771.6 Mg ha−1 in lower and higher elevation areas, respectively). Diameter at breast height (DBH) and species name were recorded for all trees with a DBH larger than 10 cm. We calculated the species number per 20 individual trees for each plot to represent alpha diversity. Beta diversity along the elevational gradient was calculated as the slope of the relationship between standardized compositional dissimilarity (beta deviation) and the elevational difference. Alpha diversity decreased in higher (17.3–12.3 species per 20 trees) and lower areas (16.8–11.3 species per 20 trees) with increasing logging intensity. Beta diversity along the elevational gradient also decreased to almost zero in highly disturbed areas. Pioneer tree species had a wider elevational range than late-successional species. These results suggest that the shift in dominant tree species after logging (from late-successional to pioneer species) was the main driver of the decline in beta diversity along the elevational gradient. We conclude that preserving and restoring beta diversity are important to sustain tropical production forests. © 2021","Elevational gradient; Forest degradation; Habitat range; Indicator species analysis; Niche width; Tropical forest conservation","Aoyagi, R.; Laboratory of Forest Ecology, Kitashirakawa Oiwake-cho, Japan; email: aoyagi.ryota@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111880573

An experiment on enrichment planting was established in 46 logging gaps in 2009 and measurements of planted individuals were done in 2011, 2014, and 2017. A cost-benefit analysis using net present value (NPV) and a sensitivity analysis were carried out on different interest rates for the production of roundwood and sawnwood. Eight years after planting, individuals of Swietenia and Handroanthus presented a diameter at breast height of 7.88 ± 1.41 cm and 5.20 ± 1.00 cm, and a Periodic Annual Increment (PAI) of 0.98 ± 0.38 cm year−1 and 0.65 ± 0.22 cm year−1, respectively.

In Sabah, Borneo, we compared an old-growth forest stand and stands that had received reduced-impact logging (RIL) or conventional logging (CL) about 20–30 years ago, in terms of Si concentration of recently abscised dead leaves, Si flux via litterfall, and water extractable Si from upper soil horizons. The Si concentration of dead leaves produced by dominant tree species in Dipterocarpaceae differed widely among genera and species (1.2–29.7 mg Si g-dry-mass−1). Some pioneer trees (e.g., Macaranga spp.) and bamboo species that dominate the RIL and CL stands exhibited high Si concentration in their dead leaves. Litterfall Si flux was higher in the RIL stand (392 kg ha−1 year−1) where bamboo was abundant, than in the CL and old-growth stands (187 and 153 kg ha−1 year−1, respectively). Water extractable Si from the soil was also the highest in the RIL stand, followed by the CL and old-growth stands. In conclusion, our study suggests that bamboos and pioneer trees with high dead-leaf Si concentrations increase Si flux in post-logging stands, in a manner to compensate for the loss of Si flux associated with decreased abundance of Si accumulating Dipterocarpaceae trees. The correlation between litterfall Si flux and water extractable soil Si among the three stands also suggests a feedback loop of Si via plants in this lowland tropical forest that received contrasting types of logging. © 2021 The Ecological Society of Japan.","Dipterocarpaceae; pioneer trees; plant silica; reduced impact logging; selective logging","Nakamura, R.; Graduate School of Asian and African Area Studies, Japan; email: rnakamura3825@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109069805

Bamboo abundance was expressed by variables collected both by field sampling and from high-resolution images using a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). Disturbance in these forests was associated with a significant reduction in the number of crowns of emergent trees and palms and an increase in the canopy fraction occupied by bamboo. A significant negative relationship was observed between the canopy area occupied by bamboo and the number of tree and palm species, regardless of the level of disturbance. Bamboo density (culms m−2) and canopy area occupied by bamboo had significant effects on community composition, indicating that bamboo abundance is a key driver affecting the floristic composition of the forest.

The number and relative abundance of species in different types of ecological strategies actually forms an ecological strategy spectrum in a community. Logging is a widespread driver of forest degradation, severely influencing the composition of communities and the ecological strategy spectra in forest ecosystems. Understanding effects of logging on the ecological strategy composition of communities is vital to biodiversity conservation and efficient restoration of degraded forest ecosystems. Yet, the knowledge of how ecological strategies of different communities respond to varying types and intensities of disturbances in tropical forests are largely unknown. Here, by establishing forest dynamics plots (FDPs) in communities experienced increasing logging intensities (no logging (old-growth (OG)), selective logging (SL), and clear-cutting (CL) and measuring plant functional traits in a tropical montane rain forest, we compared the changes in ecological strategies of these stands by using Grime's competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal (CSR) scheme and by “StrateFy” ordination method based on measurements of three plant functional traits (Leaf area (LA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), and specific leaf area (SLA)). Results showed that strategy number increased and ecological strategy spectra of communities changed significantly with increasing logging intensity: the proportion of S-selected strategies decreased while those of C- and R-selected strategies increased with increasing logging intensity.

Among these, selective logging may represent a less damaging alternative, although it may alter species compositions of animals and plants in forest ecosystems. Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) are used as bioindicators as they respond quickly to environmental changes. Thus, in this study, we tested the effects of time after logging and seasonality on species richness, number of individuals, and assemblage structure of dung beetles in central Brazilian Amazon Forest. We also identified indicator species of logged and unlogged sites. We used a total of 240 flight interception traps (20 per area) in 11 logged sites (between one and 15 years after logging) and one unlogged site. We collected 28,508 dung beetles from 85 species. Most individuals (24,349, 85.41%) were collected during the dry period. Four species were good indicators of the unlogged site, while 21 species were indicators of logged sites. Time after logging and seasonality significantly affected species richness, the number of individuals collected, and assemblage structure. These effects were more significant from the second to the fifth year after logging. Logged sites represented 77% to 95% of species richness in the unlogged site. From the sixth year after logging, dung beetle assemblages were significantly recovered. Our results show that low-impact selective logging practices in sustainable forest sites may not cause irreversible impacts on dung beetle diversity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bioindicators; Environmental impacts; Seasonality; Sustainable forest management; Tropical forest","de Moura, R.S.; Laboratório de Biodiversidade, Brazil; email: robertamourah@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105472390

Although the Amazon nut is the most important non-timber forest product (NTFP) in the Amazon basin, the species is under serious threat due to deforestation and may also be affected by overharvesting. However, selective logging of other tree species coexisting with Bertholletia may positively affect Bertholletia populations, thus enabling a special case for MFM. For this research, we investigated the impact of the intensity of Amazon nut harvesting and timber logging on Bertholletia populations in the Bolivian Amazon. We used demographic data from 72 two-hectare transects located within 24 community-based household forests varying in the intensity of nut collection (0–100%) and timber logging (0–15% of logging-disturbed forest area). Simulated Bertholletia population size increased with logging intensity but decreased with Amazon nut harvesting intensity. Bertholletia populations were projected to grow at the average MFM harvesting scenario tested: 57.4% of nut harvesting, 5.3% of logging-disturbed area (λ100 = 1.011). Our simulations also revealed that up to 89% of Amazon nut seeds can be harvested while sustaining Bertholletia populations, under 15% of logging-disturbed area, and applying liana cutting. Modest levels of timber logging and application of liana cutting may compensate for the negative effect of Amazon nut collection on Bertholletia populations for the next century. Our study demonstrates that Amazon nut and timber production could be combined in a sustainable MFM scheme, thus increasing the economic value of managed tropical forests and its promotion to reduce the increasing pressure by deforestation. © 2021 by the authors.

Several open access Earth Observation (EO) products are increasingly being used for deforestation analysis in support of national and international initiatives and policymaking on forest conservation and management. Using a combination of annual forest loss and near-real time forest disturbance products, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the deforestation events in three forest frontiers of the Philippines. A space-time pattern mining approach was used to map quarterly deforestation hotspots at 1 km pixel size (100 hectares), where hotspots are classified according to the spatial and temporal variability of the 2000–2020 deforestation in the study area. Our results revealed that 79–81% of the hotspots overlap with primary forests and 27–29% are inside the state-declared protected areas. The intra-annual analysis of deforestation in 2020 revealed an alarming trend, where most deforestation occurred between the 1st and 2nd quarter (92–94% in hotspot forests; 87–89% in non-hotspot forests), highly overlapping within the slash-and-burn farming season. We also found “new” hotspots (2020) formed mostly from landslide scars and partly from selective logging, the latter is believed to be underestimated. Our study paves the way for rapid and regular assessment of the country’s deforestation, useful for the respective environmental institutions who convene several times a year. Moreover, our findings assert the imperative of alternative livelihoods to upland farmers, efficient forest protection activities, and even the mitigation of landslide risks. © 2021 by the authors.

Quantifying these structural changes is fundamental to understanding the impact of degradation, but is challenging in dense, structurally complex forest canopies. We exploited discrete-return airborne LiDAR surveys across a gradient of logging intensity in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, and assessed how selective logging had affected canopy structure (Plant Area Index, PAI, and its vertical distribution within the canopy). LiDAR products compared well to independent, analogue models of canopy structure produced from detailed ground-based inventories undertaken in forest plots, demonstrating the potential for airborne LiDAR to quantify the structural impacts of forest degradation at landscape scale, even in some of the world's tallest and most structurally complex tropical forests. Plant Area Index estimates across the plot network exhibited a strong linear relationship with stem basal area (R2 = 0.95). After at least 11–14 years of recovery, PAI was ~28% lower in moderately logged plots and ~52% lower in heavily logged plots than that in old-growth forest plots. These reductions in PAI were associated with near-complete lack of trees &gt;30-m tall, which had not been fully compensated for by increasing plant area lower in the canopy. This structural change drives a marked reduction in the diversity of canopy environments, with the deep, dark understorey conditions characteristic of old-growth forests far less prevalent in logged sites. Full canopy recovery is likely to take decades. Synthesis and applications. Effective management and restoration of tropical forests requires detailed monitoring of the forest and its environment. We demonstrate that airborne LiDAR can effectively map the canopy architecture of the complex tropical forests of Borneo, capturing the three-dimensional impact of degradation on canopy structure at landscape scales, therefore facilitating efforts to restore and conserve these ecosystems. © 2021 British Ecological Society","Borneo; canopy structure; degradation; leaf area index; LiDAR; logging; tropical rainforest","Milodowski, D.T.; School of GeoSciences, United Kingdom; email: d.t.milodowski@ed.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107294788

If done well, selective logging can be an important way of supporting local economies while minimally impacting wildlife. However, most studies on how selective logging affects wildlife come from sites that have been logged some time ago, often a decade or more. Here we assess how logging affects species assemblages in the very short term, immediately after the cessation of timber operations. We estimated overall mammal species richness in unlogged forest, previously logged forest, and an active logging concession in Indonesian Borneo using rarefaction-extrapolation-based diversity estimators. We found that estimated species richness did not differ significantly between unlogged forest (15.5 ± 2.82 species), previously logged forest (14.5 ± 2.10), or recently logged sites (14.2 ± 1.45) sites.

Despite the widespread presence of secondary forests of various ages in Ivorian landscapes, little is known about recovery trajectories of timber resources and the environmental factors that influence recovery rates. We set up 96 0.2 ha forest plots, along a chronosequence of 1 to 40 years and including 7 controls, on which all commercial trees larger than 2.5 cm in diameter at breast height were inventoried. We modelled the recovery trajectories of four complementary indicators of timber resources (basal area, tree density, size of big trees, bole volume) in a Bayesian framework. Our results show that the four indicators recover at different rates, with tree density recovering in less than 15 years while bole volumes need more than a hundred years to recover. Among the local, landscape, and historical factors studied, the number of remnants and proximity to old-growth forests have a positive impact on recovery rates, with, under good environmental conditions, the density, basal area and size of big trees being almost completely recovered in less than 25 years. Our results demonstrate the very high resilience of the timber resource, but also suggest that the landscape management of these post-forest areas must be differentiated according to the landscape context and the presence of isolated trees, which are the last vestiges of the former forest. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian modelling; Ivory Coast; Resource recovery; Secondary forests; Timber wood; Tropical forests","Hérault, B.; Institut National Polytechnique Félix Houphouët-BoignyCote d'Ivoire; email: bruno.herault@cirad.fr",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105501366

The long-term collection of data from the Landsat missions provides some of the most valuable information for understanding the processes of global tropical forest disturbance. However, there are substantial uncertainties in the estimation of non-mechanized, small-scale (i.e., small area) clearings in tropical forests with Landsat series images. Because the appearance of small-scale openings in a tropical tree canopy are often ephemeral due to fast-growing vegetation, and because clouds are frequent in tropical regions, it is challenging for Landsat images to capture the logging signal. Moreover, the spatial resolution of Landsat images is typically too coarse to represent spatial details about small-scale clearings. In this paper, by fusing all available Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, we proposed a method to improve the tracking of small-scale tropical forest disturbance history with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. First, yearly composited Landsat and Sentinel-2 self-referenced normalized burn ratio (rNBR) vegetation index images were calculated from all available Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2 scenes during 2016–2019. Second, a deep-learning based downscaling method was used to predict fine resolution (10 m) rNBR images from the annual coarse resolution (30 m) Landsat rNBR images. Third, given the baseline Landsat forest map in 2015, the generated fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and original Sentinel-2 rNBR images were fused to produce the 10 m forest disturbance map for the period 2016–2019. From data comparison and evaluation, it was demonstrated that the deep-learning based downscaling method can produce fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and forest disturbance maps that contain substantial spatial detail. In addition, by fusing downscaled fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and original Sentinel-2 rNBR images, it was possible to produce state-of-the-art forest disturbance maps with OA values more than 87% and 96% for the small and large study areas, and detected 11% to 21% more disturbed areas than either the Sentinel-2 or Landsat-7/8 time-series alone. We found that 1.42% of the disturbed areas indentified during 2016–2019 experienced multiple forest disturbances. The method has great potential to enhance work undertaken in relation to major policies such as the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) programmes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Deep learning; Downscaling; Forest disturbance; Landsat and Sentinel-2; Small-scale clearing","Ling, F.; Key Laboratory of Monitoring and Estimate for Environment and Disaster of Hubei province, China; email: lingf@whigg.ac.cn",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105065462

SFs account for swathes of tropical forest landscapes that have lost their capacity to provide a high level of goods and services. They are also located in highly dynamic and human-pressured landscapes and are vulnerable to natural and human-induced catastrophic events, such as hurricanes or fires. Without appropriate silvicultural management to increase their economic value and restore their ecological functions, they often become degraded and are sometimes cleared for more short-term economically productive activities. Given the increasing demand for tropical timber in recent decades that will continue in the near future, we suggest that active restoration geared towards wood production is an opportunity for SF conservation. Promoting sustainable wood production -i.e. associated with other environmental services- in these disturbed forest ecosystems is also a way to reduce logging pressure on the remaining intact primary tropical forests, indeed, this may be the most important reason to enhance active restoration aimed at wood production in tropical SFs worldwide.

Across the Amazon Basin, forest-dwelling non-volant mammals play crucial roles in maintaining the integrity of forest functionality, yet have been poorly studied in fluvial island forests. Mammal assemblages may be affected by edaphic characteristics that operate indirectly via food nutritional quality, by patch attributes, and/or can be modulated by anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we conducted systematic and quantitative mammal surveys across fluvial islands of an Amazonian archipelago, to assess the influence of edaphic factors (soil fertility), island attributes (island area and degree of isolation) and anthropogenic characteristics (distance from human settlement and logging) on the patterns of mammal species composition and richness. On 28 islands, we conducted spoor surveys and deployed 49 camera traps (total effort of 2940 camera trap-days). Subsequently, we performed multiple regression analysis to investigate the influence of environmental and anthropogenic predictors on mammal species richness, while dbRDA (distance-based redundancy analysis) was used for species composition. We found that mammal species richness was positively correlated with soil fertility, and in combination with anthropogenic characteristics, both variables affected the species assemblage composition. In particular, smaller species were found across a variety of levels of soil fertility and anthropogenic disturbances, while larger mammals were mostly recorded at sites with higher soil fertility and low levels of anthropogenic disturbances. Understanding the contribution of environmental and anthropogenic characteristics to the observed mammalian species richness and assemblage composition patterns will help optimise management and conservation efforts on Amazonian fluvial islands. In particular, we suggest enforcing hunting and logging restrictions within fluvial islands through surveillance activities, especially in more fertile islands. © 2021 Ecological Society of Australia","Amazonian archipelago; anthropogenic characteristics; edaphic characteristics; non-volant mammals","Ferreira Neto, G.D.S.; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ecologia/INPA-V8 INPA, Av.

However, little work has been conducted to determine how logging road development impacts the soil microbial communities and associated C and N cycle activities in tropical forests. This study was conducted within an upland tropical forest in the Northern Zone of Costa Rica that had a 2-year abandoned logging road system (used for harvesting trees felled during a tornado) to determine how development of logging roads affected soil C and N cycle activities, efficiency of organic C use, and bacterial and fungal community compositions. Soil samples from a set of logging roads, the road edges, and adjacent primary forests were analyzed for C, N metrics, the Microbial Quotients, and DNA-based microbial taxonomic community compositions; which were tested for differences using multivariate statistical analyses. The logging road soils had significantly greater bulk density and clay, and lower levels of sand, TN, NO3−, NO3−/NH4+, TOC, C Biomass, and Microbial Quotients compared to the road edge and forest soils. The composition of the total bacterial genera of the road edge and forest soils were similar to one another and different from that of the logging road soils, and the composition of the total fungal genera was unique within each of the three areas sampled. The relative abundance of DNA sequences of N-cycle bacteria were greater, and lignin degrading bacteria and wood rot/lignin degrading fungi were less in the logging roads compared to the edge and forest soils. These results suggest that the rate of recovery of both the C and N cycle activities and associated microbial groups in the soils from the road edges is occurring more rapidly than in the abandoned logging road soils. Thus, we suggest that a new tropical forest management practice should include the movement of the slash and debris from the road edge regions onto the logging roads after abandonment, as it would enhance the rate of recovery of both the C and N cycle activities in the soils, and perhaps begin to address the concern that logging roads add an additional 10–15 years to tropical forest recovery following deforestation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Microbial diversity; Microbial structure; Soil bacteria; Soil fungi; Soil microbial ecology","Eaton, W.D.; Pace University Biology Department, One Pace Plaza, United States; email: weaton@pace.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101334149

However, the duration of these effects is poorly understood, and it is unclear whether impacts are amplified in forests with a history of previous human disturbance. Here, we focus on the Amazonian epicenter of the 2015–16 El Niño, a region that encompasses 1.2% of the Brazilian Amazon. We quantify, at high temporal resolution, the impacts of an extreme El Niño (EN) drought and extensive forest fires on plant mortality and carbon loss in undisturbed and human-modified forests. Mortality remained higher than pre-El Niño levels for 36 mo in EN-drought–affected forests and for 30 mo in EN-fire–affected forests. In EN-fire–affected forests, human disturbance significantly increased plant mortality. Our investigation of the ecological and physiological predictors of tree mortality showed that trees with lower wood density, bark thickness and leaf nitrogen content, as well as those that experienced greater fire intensity, were more vulnerable. Across the region, the 2015–16 El Niño led to the death of an estimated 2.5 ± 0.3 billion stems, resulting in emissions of 495 ± 94 Tg CO2. Three years after the El Niño, plant growth and recruitment had offset only 37% of emissions. Our results show that limiting forest disturbance will not only help maintain carbon stocks, but will also maximize the resistance of Amazonian forests if fires do occur.* © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF), which are disjointly distributed throughout the Neotropics, are especially susceptible to human activities. The Caatinga Dry Forest, located in the semi-arid interior of northeastern Brazil, represents not only the largest and most biologically diverse nucleus of SDTF, but also the world’s most densely populated semi-arid region, with ever-growing pressure on its natural resources. To prevent illegal logging, conservation agencies looked at forest management, where an area is divided in smaller stands which are gradually logged and allowed to regrow for a period of time, when a new cutting cycle should reinitiate. The impacts of these management schemes on biodiversity, however, remain largely untested. We conducted standardized avian surveys to evaluate the effects of forest management on the avian community at a 1,670 ha privately owned property located on the Chapada do Araripe, northeastern Brazil. This area was divided in 22 forest stands, half of which had already been logged at the time of our sampling, creating a gradient of logged and natural forests and an 11-yr chrono-sequence of forest regeneration. Our results show that logged areas present fewer individuals, fewer species, and different avian assemblages than unlogged forests. Such differences are mostly driven by forest-dependent species, which were overwhelmingly affected by forest management. Our results show that although logged forests tend to recover its height after a decade, they do not recover the originally forest cover, measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Likewise, decade-long recovering stands continue to show lower species richness, lower bird abundance, and different avian composition than unlogged forests. We identified a set of bird species that are more affected by forest management (ecological losers) and a group of birds that apparently benefit from the referred changes in land use (ecological winners). We conclude that completely managing an entire area may cause the extirpation of several forest-dependent species. We therefore suggest keeping logged and unlogged plots intermingled, to avoid local extinctions and the complete modification of the original avifauna. © Copyright © 2021 Ribeiro, Las-Casas, Lima, Silva and Naka.","anthropogenic disturbance; avian communities; Caatinga; ecological loser; landscape fragmentation","Naka, L.N.; Laboratory of Avian Ecology and Evolution, Brazil; email: luciano.naka@ufpe.br",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111614997

To maintain the ecosystem functions of carbon sequestration and timber supply in tropical production forests over a long term, forest management must be sustainable under changing climate conditions. Individual-based forest models are useful tools to enhance our understanding about the long-term effects of harvest and climate change on forest dynamics because they link empirical field data with simulations of ecological processes. The objective of this study is to analyze the combined effects of selective logging and climate change on biomass stocks and timber harvest in a tropical forest in French Guiana. By applying a forest model, we simulated natural forest dynamics under the baseline scenario of current climate conditions and compared the results with scenarios of selective logging under climate change. The analyses revealed how substantially forest dynamics are altered under different scenarios of climate change. (1) Repeated logging within recovery times decreased biomass and timber harvest, irrespective of the intensity of climate change. (2) With moderate climate change as envisaged by the 5th IPCC Assessment Report (representative concentration pathway 2.6), the average biomass remained the same as in the baseline scenario (−1%), but with intensive climate change (RCP 8.5), the average biomass decreased by 12%. (3) The combination of selective logging and climate change increased the likelihood of changes in forest dynamics, driven mainly by rising temperatures. Under RCP 8.5, the average timber harvest was almost halved, regardless of the logging cycle applied. An application-oriented use of forest models will help to identify opportunities to reduce the effects of unwanted ecosystem changes in a changing environment. To ensure that ecosystem functions in production forests are maintained under climate change conditions, appropriate management strategies will help to maintain biomass and harvest in production forests. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Aboveground biomass; Climate change mitigation; Forest degradation; Forest management; French Guiana; Individual-based forest modeling; Paracou; Timber harvest; Tropical forestry","Hiltner, U.; Department of Ecological Modelling, Germany; email: ulrike.hiltner@usys.ethz.ch",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104466535

We investigated selective logging along a chronosequence (mature, late secondary and early secondary forests) in a State Park in Pernambuco, Brazil, and hypothesised that it is driven by variables of supply (forest age, density, richness and biomass of living trees) and access (nearest edge and declivity). Selective logging was described by richness, density and biomass of logged trees. We predicted the relationship of logging to be positive with supply and negative with the distance of access. Logged trees comprised 267 stumps, 55 species and 5.11 Mg.ha-1 in one year, corresponding to 2.8%, 20.8% and 0.37% of living trees density, richness and biomass. Selective logging was the highest in richness in mature forest, influenced by access and forest age. Access influenced higher species removal in the early-secondary forest, despite its lower richness, while the lowest logging values were recorded in the late-secondary forest, regardless of its higher supply than early-secondary forest. Logging occurs in more accessible areas, where tree species exploitation will depend on the available supply. In this scenario, integrated actions for biodiversity and ecosystem services conservation should account for socioeconomic demands, vigilance and control. © 2021 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação","Conservation; Ecosystem service trade-off; Extraction; Park management; Tropical forest; Wood provision","Lins-e-Silva, A.C.B.; Laboratório de Ecologia Vegetal, Brazil; email: ana.blsilva@ufrpe.br",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108958730

However, the knowledge of insect community compositions in regenerating logged forests is still limited, especially in the Afrotropics. Here, we evaluated the recovery patterns of fruit-feeding butterfly communities in four different-aged secondary forest compartments and one primary forest compartment in the Budongo Central Forest Reserve, Uganda. In each compartment, butterflies were sampled monthly for five consecutive months in 2017 using traps baited with fermented bananas. A total of 3,778 individuals, representing 82 species (78 identified at the species level and four morphogroups) were recorded. The fruit-feeding butterfly community composition differed among forest compartments and study months. Fruit-feeding butterfly communities of the oldest 72-year-old secondary forest compartment were similar to the primary forest compartment. In the younger secondary forest compartments the seasonal variation was large; especially the communities of the “core” rainy season months were distinct from the communities in primary and oldest secondary forest. The majority of individuals captured from both primary and secondary forests represented forest-dependent species. Primary forests are irreplaceable for preserving the diversity of tropical forests in the long-term.

While effects of deforestation on aboveground interactions have been well studied, the responses of interactions among plant, soil bacterial and fungal communities to deforestation are pooly understood and their effects on vegetation restoration remain unknown. We sequenced soil 16S rRNA and ITS genes from the primary forest without logging history and secondary forests that had been clear cut or selective cut and left to recover for up to 50 years in the typical tropical rainforest in Hainan Island. Soil bacterial-fungal, plant-bacterial and plant-fungal associations were illustrated via ecological network analysis, and their correlations with plant composition, soil and litter properties were examined to explore the links to ecosystem functions. A higher negative proportion of bacterial-fungal interactions was found in selective cut sites while a higher positive proportion presented in clear cut sites. The changes after selective cut was related to tree composition and reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus content from soil and litter, indicating increased competition for nutrients, decoupling of communities and niche differentiation. The bacterial-fungal interaction changes after clear cut was associated with decrease in tree biomass and soil carbon content while increase in litter carbon content, implying increased co-operation in nutrient strategies and community homogenization. This ecological implications of bacterial-fungal interaction after clear cut was also applicable to plant-microbial interaction showing modular structure and strong across-module associations and significant correlations with litter carbon and soil nitrogen availability, which was indicative of a particular collection of microbial members under given plant species driving by changes in carbon and nitrogen content. Overall, the responses of bacterial-fungal and plant–microbe interactions to selective cut may in term promote the recovery of plant diversity during forest restoration, whereas these responses to clear cut may hinder the recovery of plant community diversity, and more costly restoration approaches based on different tree species planting will be required. This study suggested that the interkingdom interactions in below-aboveground metacommunity are indicative of changes in tree composition and soil fertility during the restoration of logged forest, and changes in such interkingdom interactions could in turn influence plant diversity and soil nutrients transformation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial-fungal interactions; Forest management regimes; Interdomain ecological network; Plant-microbe associations; Rhizosphere processes; Tropical rainforest","Xu, H.; Research Institute of Tropical Forestry, Longdong, China; email: hanxu81@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103675591

While the preceding decade has seen a tremendous improvement in the ability to monitor forest disturbances from space, large-scale (spatial and temporal) forest monitoring systems have almost universally relied on optical satellite data from the Landsat program, whose effectiveness is limited in tropical regions with frequent cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can penetrate clouds and have been utilized in forest mapping applications since the early 1990s, but only recently has SAR data been widely available on a scale sufficient to facilitate pan-tropical selective logging detection systems. Here, a detailed selective logging dataset from three lowland tropical forest regions in the Brazilian Amazon was used to assess the effectiveness of SAR data from Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2, and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) for monitoring tropical selective logging. We built Random Forests models aimed at classifying pixel-based differences between logged and unlogged areas. In addition, we used the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm to assess if a dense time series of Sentinel-1 imagery displayed recognizable shifts in pixel values after selective logging. In general, Random Forests classification with SAR data (Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2, and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) performed poorly, having high commission and omission errors for logged observations. This suggests little to no difference in pixel-based metrics between logged and unlogged areas for these sensors, particularly at lower logging intensities. In contrast, the Sentinel-1 time series analyses indicated that areas under higher intensity selective logging (&gt; 20 m3 ha−1) show a distinct spike in the number of pixels that included a breakpoint during the logging season. BFAST detected breakpoints in 50% of logged pixels and exhibited a false alarm rate of approximately &lt;5% in unlogged forest. Overall our results suggest that SAR data can be used in time series analyses to detect tropical selective logging at high intensity logging locations (&gt; 20 m3 ha−1) within the Amazon. © 2021 The Author(s)","ALOS-2; Brazil; Degradation; Forest disturbance; PALSAR-2; RADARSAT-2; Random Forest; Selective logging; Sentinel-1; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Tropical forest","Hethcoat, M.G.; School of Mathematics and Statistics, United Kingdom; email: HethcoatMG@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104993280

Despite significant enforcement efforts of these regulations, illegal logging continues to be a serious problem and impacts for the functioning of the forest ecosystem and global biodiversity in the tropics. Microscopic analysis of wood samples and the use of conventional plant DNA barcodes often do not allow to distinguish closely-related species. The use of novel molecular technologies could make an important contribution for the identification of tree species. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools to obtain the complete de-novo chloroplast genome of 62 commercial African timber species using the genome skimming method.

Since the use of wood resources disturbs ecosystems, overharvesting destroys local ecosystems, resulting in a decline in ecosystem services. Therefore, there is a need to balance the use of wood resources by people with the health of the ecosystem. In this study, we evaluated wood provisioning in newly established national parks in Okinawa Main Island, Japan, for future sustainable management. We clarified the spatial distribution between the forest stand volume obtained from LiDAR data, the logging sites before the national park designation, and national park zoning. We found that the buffer zone contains some forests with high stand volume that continue from the core area. There had not been much logging in recent years, but most logging sites were located in the buffer zone and within 200m from roads. Forests with aged stands and high stand volume are important as buffers to prevent isolation of the core area. Therefore, park managers need to consider not only the legal regulations for each zone but also the continuity with the surrounding natural environment to prevent isolation of the core area. Understanding the spatial distribution of wood resources and park zoning relationships at a fine-scale resolution will be useful for managing buffer zones where there is competition between conservation and resource use. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Annual allowable cut; Ecosystem services; Forested landscape; Park management; Sustainability; Yambaru National Park","Miyamoto, A.; Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, 1 Matsunosato, Japan; email: asakom@ffpri.affrc.go.jp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103035399

Sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum), the African mahogany, and Tali (Erythrophleum suaveolens) are food sources for these caterpillars; they are also among the most important timber species harvested from Congo Basin forests. This study quantified the yield of caterpillars from harvestable and precommercial sizes of trees of these two timber species to better understand the impact of logging on the availability of edible caterpillars to local people, and the implications for managing both timber and non-timber resources in industrial timber concessions. Caterpillars were collected and weighed beneath 50 Sapelli trees 23–190 cm DBH and 170 Tali trees 22–174 cm DBH on two timber concessions, from mid-August to mid-September, over two years. Caterpillars were found to descend from the trees during 5 days each year, and quantities varied between years. In both sample years, yields were significantly higher from harvestable trees larger than the minimum cutting diameter than from precommercial trees. Each harvestable Sapelli tree (≥ 80 cm DBH), yielded an average of 11.3 kg fresh weight of I. oyemensis year-1; smaller, precommercial trees yielded 5.4 kg tree−1year−1. Each harvestable Tali tree (≥ 60 cm DBH) yielded an average of 9.1 kg of C. forda year−1, as compared to 5.7 kg tree−1year−1 from precommercial trees. This means that industrial timber harvesting, which removes trees larger than the minimum cutting diameter, has a disproportionate effect on the availability of caterpillars. However, trees below the minimum cutting diameter also yield caterpillars, and may occur at higher densities. Guidelines that limit harvesting on steep slopes or near watercourses, or that call for retaining large trees as seed sources, also safeguard caterpillar yields. However, multiple resource management should consider proactive measures, which could include zoning areas near villages as sources of edible caterpillars, and protecting those trees from logging. © 2021","Concession; Entandrophragma cylindricum; Erythrophleum suaveolens; Forest management; NTFP; Wild foods","Snook, L.K.; Forest Management and Restoration, Via di San Domenico 1, Italy; email: l.snook@cgiar.org",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102632438

However, the impacts of logging and active restoration, by liberation cutting and enrichment planting, on tree community composition are poorly understood compared to trajectories of biomass recovery. Here, we assess the long-term impacts of selective logging and active restoration for biomass recovery on tree species diversity, community composition, and forest structure. We censused all stems ≥2 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) on 46 permanent plots in unlogged, primary forest in the Danum Valley Conservation Area (DVCA; 12 plots, totalling 0.6 ha) and in sites logged 23–35 years prior to the census in the Ulu Segama Forest Reserve adjacent to DVCA (34 plots, totalling 1.7 ha) in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Active restoration treatments, including enrichment planting and climber cutting, were implemented on 17 of the logged forest plots 12–24 years prior to the census. Total plot-level basal area and pole (5–10 cm DBH) stem density were lower in logged than unlogged forests, however no difference was found in stem density amongst saplings (2–5 cm DBH) or established trees (≥10 cm DBH). Neither basal area, nor plot-level stem density varied with time since logging at any size class, although sapling and pole stem densities were lower in actively restored than naturally regenerating logged forest. Sapling species diversity was lower in logged than unlogged forest, however there were no other significant effects of logging on tree species richness or diversity indices. Tree species composition, however, differed between logged and unlogged forests across all stem size classes (PERMANOVA), reflected by 23 significant indicator species that were only present in unlogged forest. PERMANOVA tests revealed no evidence that overall species composition changed with time since logging or with active restoration treatments at any size class. However, when naturally regenerating and actively restored communities were compared, two indicator species were identified in naturally regenerating forest and three in actively restored forests. Together our results suggest that selective logging has a lasting effect on tree community composition regardless of active restoration treatments and, even when species richness and diversity are stable, species composition remains distinct from unlogged forest for more than two decades post-harvest. Active restoration efforts should be targeted, monitored, and refined to try to ensure positive outcomes for multiple metrics of forest recovery. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Enrichment planting; Lowland rain forest; Selective logging; Silviculture; Species diversity; Tropical forest","Hayward, R.M.; Biological and Environmental Sciences, United Kingdom; email: robinmhayward@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101531867

While global tree cover is being mapped with increasing accuracy from space, much less is known about the quality of that tree cover. Here we present a field protocol for rapid assessments of forest condition. Using extensive field data from Tanzania, we show that a focus on remotely-sensed deforestation would not detect significant reductions in forest quality. Radar-based remote sensing of degradation had good agreement with the ground data, but the ground surveys provided more insights into the nature and drivers of degradation. We recommend the combined use of rapid field assessments and remote sensing to provide an early warning, and to allow timely and appropriately targeted conservation and policy responses. Summary: Tropical forest degradation is widely recognised as a driver of biodiversity loss and a major source of carbon emissions. However, in contrast to deforestation, more gradual changes from degradation are challenging to detect, quantify and monitor. Here, we present a field protocol for rapid, area-standardised quantifications of forest condition, which can also be implemented by non-specialists. Using the example of threatened high-biodiversity forests in Tanzania, we analyse and predict degradation based on this method. We also compare the field data to optical and radar remote-sensing datasets, thereby conducting a large-scale, independent test of the ability of these products to map degradation in East Africa from space. Our field data consist of 551 ‘degradation’ transects collected between 1996 and 2010, covering >600 ha across 86 forests in the Eastern Arc Mountains and coastal forests. Degradation was widespread, with over one-third of the study forests—mostly protected areas—having more than 10% of their trees cut. Commonly used optical remote-sensing maps of complete tree cover loss only detected severe impacts (≥25% of trees cut), that is, a focus on remotely-sensed deforestation would have significantly underestimated carbon emissions and declines in forest quality. Radar-based maps detected even low impacts (<5% of trees cut) in ~90% of cases. The field data additionally differentiated types and drivers of harvesting, with spatial patterns suggesting that logging and charcoal production were mainly driven by demand from major cities. Rapid degradation surveys and radar remote sensing can provide an early warning and guide appropriate conservation and policy responses. This is particularly important in areas where forest degradation is more widespread than deforestation, such as in eastern and southern Africa. © 2021 The Authors.

In this project, we demonstrated that critical differences in soil C and N metrics, organic C use efficiency, and DNA-identified bacterial community structures occurred along a land use disturbance gradient in a humid tropical primary forest (PF) Costa Rica following deforestation and conversion of the forest into logging roads (LR), grasslands that were grazed and then abandoned (GR), and regenerating secondary forests (SF). The mean proportion of DNA sequences, their richness and diversity for total bacterial genera and those linked to N-fixation, ammonium oxidation, and degradation of complex organic C compounds were generally greater in the PF than the SF soils, followed by the GR and then the LR soils. The specific land use-associated changes in soil NO3−/NH4+, TN, TOC, and biomass C/TOC best predicted these differences in bacterial communities. The SF soil ecosystems were on a better trajectory towards similarity with the PF soils, followed by the GR soils, with the LR soils still being the most negatively influenced. This study showed that the soil biotic and abiotic factors were clearly different along the disturbance gradient, with each soil ecosystem responding differently to the forest clearing, followed by development of logging roads, abandoned grasslands, and secondary forests. This work also showed that differences in C and N metrics, and the structure of total and functional group communities of bacteria, in particular, the genera Solibacter, Burkholderia, Bradyrhizobium, Comamonas, Geobacter, Azospirillum, Nitrospira, Nitrosovibrio, Rhodoplanes and Phenylobacterium can serve as future indicators of soil damage and recovery following different types of disturbances. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Ammonium oxidation; Deforestation; Nitrogen fixation; Organic carbon use; Soil microorganisms","Eaton, W.D.; Pace University Biology Department, One Pace Plaza, United States; email: weaton@pace.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103725149

Logged forests are a predominant feature of the tropical forest landscape, their area exceeding that of intact forest. We quantified both total and component (root, mycorrhiza, litter, and soil organic matter, SOM) soil respiration in logged (n = 5) and old-growth (n = 6) forest plots in Malaysian Borneo, a region which is a global hotspot for emission from forest degradation. We constructed a detailed below-ground carbon budget including organic carbon inputs into the system via litterfall and root turnover. Total soil respiration was significantly higher in logged forests than in old-growth forests (14.3 ± 0.23 and 12.7 ± 0.60 Mg C ha−1 year−1, respectively, p = 0.037). This was mainly due to the higher SOM respiration in logged forests (55 ± 3.1% of the total respiration in logged forests vs. 50 ± 3.0% in old-growth forests). In old-growth forests, annual SOM respiration was equal to the organic carbon inputs into the soil (difference between SOM respiration and inputs 0.18 Mg C ha−1 year−1, with 90% confidence intervals of −0.41 and 0.74 Mg C ha−1 year−1), indicating that the system is in equilibrium, while in logged forests SOM respiration exceeded the inputs by 4.2 Mg C ha−1 year−1 (90% CI of 3.6 and 4.9 Mg C ha−1 year−1), indicating that the soil is losing carbon. These results contribute towards understanding the impact of logging on below-ground carbon dynamics, which is one of the key uncertainties in estimating emissions from forest degradation. This study demonstrates how significant perturbation of the below-ground carbon balance, and consequent net soil carbon emissions, can persist for decades after a logging event in tropical forests. © 2021 The Authors.

It is widely believed that these emergent conditions are responsible for driving changes in communities of organisms found in modified tropical forests, although the empirical evidence base for this is lacking. Here we investigated how interactions between the physiological traits of genera and the environmental temperatures they experience lead to functional and compositional changes in communities of ants, a key organism in tropical forest ecosystems. We found that the abundance and activity of ant genera along a gradient of forest disturbance in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, was defined by an interaction between their thermal tolerance (CTmax) and environmental temperature. In more disturbed, warmer habitats, genera with high CTmax had increased relative abundance and functional activity, and those with low CTmax had decreased relative abundance and functional activity. This interaction determined abundance changes between primary and logged forest that differed in daily maximum temperature by a modest 1.1°C, and strengthened as the change in microclimate increased with disturbance. Between habitats that differed by 5.6°C (primary forest to oil palm) and 4.5°C (logged forest to oil palm), a 1°C difference in CTmax among genera led to a 23% and 16% change in relative abundance, and a 22% and 17% difference in functional activity. CTmax was negatively correlated with body size and trophic position, with ants becoming significantly smaller and less predatory as microclimate temperatures increased. Our results provide evidence to support the widely held, but never directly tested, assumption that physiological tolerances underpin the influence of disturbance-induced microclimate change on the abundance and function of invertebrates in tropical landscapes.

Consequently, it is necessary to identify the vulnerability of ecosystems in long term and quantify the losses that are generated at different scales, as a result of the intense events of rain and strong winds. Objective: Determining behavior and recovery status in a secondary forest directly affected by Hurricane Otto in Boca Tapada, Pital, San Carlos, Costa Rica. Methods: Ten 20 x 50 m sampling units were systematically distributed within a secondary forest affected by Hurricane Otto in Boca Tapada, San Carlos. The current condition of the forest was evaluated, the species that received the most damage due to high winds were identified, as well as those that have the capacity to recover through regrowths. An overflight was carried out with an unmanned aerial vehicle and an orthomosaic was constructed, subsequently digitized, and classified according to the state of the forest cover presented in three evaluated moments, initial condition, after logging and the condition at the time of sampling. Population density, diversity, and basal area, were compared to data obtained in an adjacent primary forest also affected by the passage of Hurricane Otto. Results: It was obtained that 69.5 % of individuals with d ≥ 5 cm are in good condition, 20.3 % were broken in the tree canopy and 12.7% inclined without exposure of the roots. The family that provided the greatest species richness is Fabaceae, which is the same with the greatest abundance of damaged individuals and the one with the highest number of species with the ability to resprouting. The species that suffered the most damage was Couma macrocarpa (Euphorbiaceae). The initial area of forest cover was reduced by 7.63 % due to logging and 44.25 % due to Hurricane Otto. It was determined that there are significant differences in species diversity (P = 0.0004; α = 0.05) and in the density of individuals (P = 0.0011; α = 0.05). The secondary forest has the highest average in both cases. There are no significant differences in the values of the basal area (P = 0.6951; α = 0.05). Conclusions: 30.5 % of the forest mass was affected by the passage of Hurricane Otto and the Fabaceae family plays an important role in forest recovery. In addition, forest harvesting in a forest can increase the risk of being affected by the passage of hurricanes and the secondary forest has a greater diversity of species and a higher density of individuals than the primary forest. © 2021, Universidad de Costa Rica.

This study contributes to this effort by estimating the aboveground volume and carbon present in commercial tree species in a managed forest in the forest harvest stage in Brazil’s state of Acre. A total of 12,794 trees of commercial species were measured. Trees were categorized and quantified as: “harvested trees” (“harvest or cut”), which were felled in the harvest stage, and “remaining trees” (“future cutting,” “trees in permanent protection areas or APPs,” “seed trees,” “rare trees” and “trees protected by law”) that remained standing in the forest post-harvest. Aboveground volume and carbon stocks of the 81 commercial species (diameter at breast height [DBH] ≥ 10 cm) totaled 79.19 m3 ha−1 and 21.54 MgC ha−1, respectively. The category “harvested trees” represents 44.48% and “remaining trees” 55.49% of the aboveground volume stocks. In the managed area, the category “harvested trees” is felled; this is composed of the commercial bole that is removed (19.25 m3 ha−1 and 5.32 MgC ha−1) and the stump and crown that remain in the forest as decomposing organic material (15.97 m3 ha−1 and 4.41 MgC ha−1). We can infer that the 21.54 MgC ha−1 carbon stock of standing commercial trees (DBH ≥ 10 cm) represents 13.20% of the total aboveground carbon in the managed area. The commercial boles removed directly from the forest represent 3.26% of the total aboveground carbon, and the stumps and crowns of the harvested trees represent the loss of an additional 2.70%. For sustainability of the management system in terms of carbon balance, growth in the 35-year management cycle must be sufficient to replace not only these amounts (0.27 MgC ha−1 year−1) but also losses to collateral damage and to additional logging-related effects from increased vulnerability to forest fires. Financial viability of future management cycles will depend on replenishment of commercial trees of harvestable size (DBH ≥ 50 cm). © 2021 by the authors.

Supporting precise GHG estimations and counteract-ing illegal fire usages in the tropics require timely and thematically detailed large-scale information on fire-related forest disturbances. Multi-sensor optical and radar detection and ranging (radar) remote sensing data combined with active fire alerts shows the potential for a more in-depth characterization of fire-related forest disturbances. We utilized dense optical (Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) time series to individually map forest disturbances in the province of Riau (Indonesia) for 2018–2019. We combined the sensor-specific optical and radar forest disturbance maps with daily active fire alerts and classified their temporal relationship (predating, coinciding, postdating) into seven so-called archetypes of fire-related forest disturbances. The archetypes reflect sensor-specific sensitives of optical (e.g., changes in tree foliage) and radar (e.g., changes in tree structure) data to detect varying types of forest disturbances, ranging from either a loss of tree foliage and/or structure predating, coinciding or postdating fires. These can be related to different magni-tudes of fire-related forest disturbances and burn severities and can be associated with specific land management practices, such as slash-and-burn agriculture and salvage logging. This can support policy development, local and regional forest management and law enforcement to reduce illegal fire usage in the tropics. Results suggest that a delayed or opposing forest disturbance detection in the optical and radar signal is not only caused by environmental influences or different observation densities but, in some cases, such as fire-related forest disturbances, can be related to their different sensitives to detect changes in tree foliage and structure. Multi-sensor-based forest monitoring approaches should, therefore, not simply combine optical and radar time series on a data level, as it bears the risk of introducing artefacts. © 2021 by the authors.

The services that forests provide enable the forest-dependent people and communities to meet their livelihood needs and well-being. Nevertheless, the world’s forests face a twin environmental problem of deforestation and forest degradation (D&FD), resulting in ubiquitous depletion of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services and eventual loss of forest cover. Ghana, like any tropical forest developing country, is not immune to these human-caused D&FD. This paper reviews Ghana’s D&FD driven by a plethora of pressures, despite many forest policies and interventions to ensure sustainable management and forest use. The review is important as Ghana is experiencing an annual D&FD rate of 2%, equivalent to 135,000 hectares loss of forest cover. Although some studies have focused on the causes of D&FD on Ghana’ forests, they failed to show the chain of causal links of drivers that cause D&FD. This review fills the knowledge and practice gap by adopting the Driver-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses (DPSIR) analytical framework to analyse the literature-based sources of causes D&FD in Ghana. Specifically, the analysis identified agriculture expansion, cocoa farming expansion, illegal logging, illegal mining, population growth and policy failures and lapses as the key drivers of Ghana’s D&FD. The study uses the DPSIR analytical framework to show the chain of causal links that lead to the country’s D&FD and highlights the numerous interventions required to reverse and halt the ubiquitous perpetual trend of D&FD in Ghana. Similar tropical forest countries experiencing D&FD will find the review most useful to curtail the menace. © 2021 by the authors.

Body size and body condition are important metrics of fitness that may be affected by habitat degradation. We conducted a four-year study to investigate how selective logging impacted the body size and body condition index (BCI) of 55 Bornean bird species and whether changes in body metrics were associated with shifts in relative population abundance. Frugivorous and omnivorous birds had reduced body size in selectively logged versus unlogged forest, but we found no evidence for selective removal of individuals driven by sex differences or post-fledging body size, indicating different developmental conditions for frugivores and omnivores in logged forest. Change in body size between forest types showed no clear patterns for insectivorous birds, and did not differ between IUCN categories. BCI of birds was affected by study year, suggesting an effect of climatic conditions on food availability, but not by logging. At the community level, post-logging change in population abundance was not associated with reduced body size, although between species variation suggests that adverse environmental conditions and different coping strategies underlie body size reductions in logged forest. Our study suggests that body size is a valuable metric to assess how logging impacts forest birds, pointing towards potential functional consequences related to seed dispersal within logged forests and need for improved silvicultural practices. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Body condition; Body size; Land-use change; Phenotypic plasticity; Selective logging; Tropical birds","Messina, S.; Behavioural Ecology & Ecophysiology Group, Universiteitsplein 1, Belgium; email: simone.messina@uantwerpen.be",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101859300

The lumber industry in the Brazilian Amazon region produces a significant volume of lumber, and as a consequence of frequent non-optimal procedures, considerable amounts of waste are generated. In order to optimize the timber production and to minimize the environmental damage associated with low yields of sawmills, two features are indispensable: the lumber yield and the quality of the logs. The aim of this research was to analyze the wood quality and lumber yield of logs of tree species harvested from natural stands in the Amazon rainforest. A total of 120 logs from 21 tree species were harvested from natural stands in the state of Pará, Brazil, and analyzed for wood quality. Out of these, 60 logs were evaluated for lumber yield. The most common defects found in the logs were flattening, surface cracks, and eccentricity of the pith. By means of the principal component analysis, the Mezilaurus itauba, Protium decandrum, and Caryocar villosum species stood out. The average lumber yield was 45%. The Bowdichia nitida and C. villosum species presented the highest yield values (average of 63%). There was a trend of correlation between the lumber yield and the quality of the logs. Based on the methodology used to analyze the quality of the logs, inferences can be made on the yield of the logging and, consequently, the sustainability of the timber industries in the Brazilian Amazon. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Crack; Planks; Primary log breakdown; Rainforest; Sawmill; Scouring","de Paula Protásio, T.; Federal Rural University of Amazonia-UFRA, Brazil; email: depaulaprotasio@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086111171

The effects of this process are little known, especially in areas subjected to forest management which show distinct growth dynamics when compared to unmanaged natural areas.

The data used originated from 18 permanent plots of 1 ha each, which were monitored for 12 years after Reduced Impact Logging (RIL). For the competition analysis, 23 indices were tested. CIs were evaluated based on graphical analyses and linear correlation coefficients(r)between each index and variables, basal area growth(ΔG), probability of mortality(Pm), and post-logging period (PLP).

In Central Amazon, topographic gradients and soil water levels drive differences in tree species distribution and in forest dynamics at local scales. Knowing this kind of information can be useful for a forest manager to plan harvesting operations considering the microhabitat preference of merchantable species to reduce the disturbances caused by logging activities. Thus, the spatial variation of tree species is an important information to be considered to support the planning process of forest logging. The present study aims to evaluate the spatial distribution pattern of six species and analyze the relationship between the topography and the population densities and stem size of those species. The study was carried out in a forest production compartment managed by a private company located in the municipality of Silves, state of Amazonas, Brazil. The spatial pattern of the six species was characterized by Ripley's K function. Spatial distribution of diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree density based on kernel incidence calculation were evaluated for topographic classes of slope, elevation, and distance from streams, which were mapped using geographic information systems (GIS). The means of DBH and density of each species were compared among topographic classes by ANOVA and Tukey's test. The results demonstrated the predominance of the aggregate distribution pattern for the six species up to 1105 m (p < 0.01). The tree species Minquartia guianensis Aubl., Protium puncticulatum J.F.Macbr, Manilkara elata (Allemão ex Miq.) Monach, and Caryocar glabrum Aubl. Pers showed an increase in the tree density as the distance from the streams and elevation increased, standing spatially incident on plateaus. Kernel densities of Dinizia excelsa Ducke and Goupia glabra Aubl. were higher closer to streams. The DBH averages followed similar trends of population density for M. guianensis, M. elata, and C. glabrum, and the opposite pattern for D. excelsa, which presented larger individuals in less densely populated areas. P. puncticulatum and G. glabra mean DBH distribution was not affected by the topographic variables analyzed. Topography-related variables showed effects on variations of density and tree size, suggesting that species may be spatially sensitive to the habitat variability available in the study area. In view of logging planning, spatial distribution must be considered in decisions related to cutting down trees and maintenance of remaining trees, especially because some species are more aggregated in smaller scales. Moreover, as topographic variations affect the spatial distribution of size and density, the timber yield will vary spatially in the area, bringing implications for planning logging intensities, roads, skid trails and forest operations. Finally, the procedures and information generated in this study can be reproduced and applied to other species and managed areas to support the planning toward minimizing impacts on the spatial structure of commercial species, as well as to increase the chances of future stock recovery of managed forests in the Amazon. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Forest management; Geographic information systems; Ripley's K function; Site quality; Tropical forest","Miron, A.C.; Graduate Program in Tropical Forest Science, André Araújo Avenue, 2936, Petrópolis, Brazil; email: carol.miron0@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098557468

Due to limited radiometric sensitivity to forest biomass variation at C-band, basic multitemporal change detection approach was supplemented by spatial texture analysis to separate disturbed forest from intact. The developed technique primarily uses multi-temporal aggregation of orthorectified synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery that are acquired before and after the logging operations. The actual change analysis is based on textural features of the log-ratio image calculated using two SAR temporal composites compiled of SAR scenes acquired before and after the logging operations. Multitemporal aggregation and filtering of SAR scenes decreased speckle and made the extracted textural features more prominent. The overall detection accuracy was around 80%, with some underestimation of the area of forest disturbance compared to reference based on optical data. The user’s accuracy for disturbed forest varied from 76.7% to 94.9% depending on the accuracy assessment approach.

Radar satellite signals can penetrate through clouds, allowing Sentinel-1 to provide gap-free observations for the tropics consistently every 6–12 days at 10 m spatial scale. In the densely cloud covered Congo Basin, this represents a major advantage for the rapid detection of small-scale forest disturbances such as subsistence agriculture and selective logging. Alerts were detected with latest available Sentinel-1 images and results are presented from January 2019 to July 2020. We mapped 4 million disturbance events during this period, totalling 1.4 million ha with nearly 80% of events smaller than 0.5 ha. Monthly distribution of alert totals varied widely across the Congo Basin countries and can be linked to regional differences in wet and dry season cycles, with more forest disturbances in the dry season. Results indicated high user’s and producer’s accuracies and the rapid confirmation of alerts within a few weeks. Our disturbance alerts provide confident detection of events larger than or equal to 0.2 ha but do not include smaller events, which suggests that disturbance rates in the Congo Basin are even higher than presented in this study.

Effective restoration requires information on the condition of degraded forests. This study aimed to understand the conditions of illegally logged stands that had also experienced inappropriately short rotations between legal logging cycles in natural production forests in Myanmar. Four rectangular plots (each 0.64 ha) were established in 2013. The plots included illegally logged stumps in three compartments where the latest legal logging was conducted in 2011 after very short rotations between legal logging cycles (up to five harvests between 1995 and 2011, compared with a recommended 30-year logging cycle). Using data from the field measurements in 2013 on the legal and illegal stumps and living trees, we reconstructed stand structure just before and after legal logging in 2011. Before the legal logging in 2011, there were variations in stand structure and the composition of commercial species among four plots. Illegal logging (14–31 trees ha−1 ) was much higher than legal logging (0–11 trees ha−1 ). Illegal logging targeted six to nine species that were suitable for high-quality charcoal from various sized trees, while legal logging targeted one or two timber species with a diameter at breast height (DBH) larger than 58 cm. The number of remaining trees in 2013 ranged from 33 to 181 trees ha−1 . There was a negative relationship with the number of bamboo clumps, which varied from 6 to 145 clumps ha−1 . Bamboo-dominated stands with a low remaining stock of commercial trees may need active restoration such as bamboo cutting and replanting of commercial species. Bamboo cutting could generate income for the local community. © 2021 by the authors.

Even though these forests are degraded to a variable degree, they are still important for tropical forest biodiversity. It is not yet known how biodiversity is impacted during and immediately after logging, and how fast it recovers. Here, we use ecoacoustics, and specifically the recording and analysis of soundscape dawn time series, to monitor the immediate impact and early recovery of biodiversity after selective logging. We describe the results of capturing a dawn time series of soundscapes in a Bornean tropical lowland forest before, during, and after selective logging. Soundscape saturation, which is correlated with the number of different calls that make up the soundscape, dropped significantly immediately after selective logging was carried out. The reduced saturation was mostly due to the loss of bird vocalizations, whereas insects did not seem to be impacted. In a space-for-time recording from the same area, soundscape saturation during the equivalent time of day recovered after one year, however began to drop again in years 2 and 3 after logging. Our results are suggestive of a strong effect of logging and seasonality on tropical forest soundscapes. Being able to track biodiversity changes and recovery over time in tropical forests managed for timber production can ultimately improve our odds of avoiding more species extinctions, by providing evidence-based recommendations on how much time forests need to recover biodiversity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation effectiveness; East Kalimantan; Ecoacoustics; False-colour spectrogram; Indonesia; Soundscape indices; Soundscape saturation; Timber management","Burivalova, Z.; Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology and The Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies, United States; email: burivalova@wisc.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099613000

In this study, we investigated the effects of chainsaw milling (logging) and artisanal mining on terrestrial small mammal communities in a tropical forest in Ghana. For this, we compared abundance, diversity measures and community composition of small mammals active at the forest floor in logged, mined and undisturbed forest sites. We found that abundance was higher in logged and undisturbed forest sites than in mined sites. Small mammal species richness, Shannon diversity and Pielou’s evenness did not differ significantly among the three forest disturbance categories. Community composition of small mammals varied between mined and undisturbed sites as well as between mined and logged sites, suggesting differential species responses to altered environments. This may be due to the presence of pits in mined forest sites, hence a reduction in exploitable ground habitat structures for shelter, nesting or food. Overall, our results suggest that artisanal mining has strong impacts on community composition of forest floor small mammals in tropical forests while the effect of logging by chainsaw milling activities is minimal, especially when practiced at low intensity. This effect was moderated by elevation and distance to streams that equally shaped small mammal communities.

While once-logged evergreen and deciduous forests were similar to their respective baselines for most attributes assessed, and twice-logged evergreen forests had 22–24% lower adult tree density and diversity, twice-logged deciduous forests had 17–50% lower canopy cover, pole density, adult species diversity and above-ground carbon stocks, and 12% higher deciduous fractions compared to the baselines.

These impacts can potentially be mitigated by reducing logging frequency and retaining unlogged patches in logged landscapes, but management must also incorporate heterogeneity in responses and recovery across different forest types. In the Andaman Islands, all forests may require more than 15–25 years between logging events, with deciduous forests potentially requiring more stringent extraction limits compared to evergreen forests. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Andaman Islands; Deciduousness; India; Repeat-logged forests; Selective logging; Tropical forest","Surendra, A.; Greeley Memorial Laboratory, 370 Prospect St, United States; email: akshaysurendra1@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096863784

Here we examine if logging –a prevalent activity in the tropics– drives a pattern of differential defaunation in a Neotropical forest managed by a community of indigenous people. Using a match-paired design, we conducted mammalian surveys during four consecutive years in three independent sites, each one including (1) areas for logging practiced by Maya communities of the Yucatan Peninsula (selective and interspaced harvesting), and (2) adjacent areas set aside as reserves. We found that in logged areas the abundance of medium and large mammals decreased (4.3-fold, overall), while the abundance of small mammals increased (2.5-fold, overall). We posit that these changes result from a combination of factors, including: (1) facilitated access for hunters of medium- and large-sized game, comprising both predators (potentially leading to small-prey release) and competitors of small-bodied species; (2) changes in vegetation (e.g., more shelter and food for rodents); and (3) contrasting animal life history traits (population growth rate, home range size). We conclude that although non-intensive logging interventions have negative consequences for the mammalian community (for at least ten years after harvesting), the indigenous practices of rotational harvesting and maintaining reserves help to prevent the landscape-wide mammalian declines known to occur under large-scale industrial logging. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Differential defaunation; Indirect effects of logging; Mammalian community shifts; Rodents; Tropical rainforest","Gutiérrez-Granados, G.; UMIEZ, Batalla 5 de mayo s/n esquina Fuerte de Loreto, Col.

The objective of this research is to assess deforestation in the department of Alibori using satellite imagery. Planimetric data from the 2005 and 2015 SPOT 5 and 7 images, provided by the spatial observation of tropical forests (OSFACO) project, were interpreted and analyzed. Digital processing of the satellite images was carried out using QGIS 2.18.2 software, in particular the Train Random Forest Image Classifier module contained in the Orfeo ToolBox. Ground control was carried out through 852 GPS points. The average accuracy of the land cover maps was approximately 96 %. The results revealed a decline in natural vegetation types in favor of mosaics of fields and fallow land. Gallery forests, dry forests, woodlands, and wooded and shrubby savannas were converted into mosaics of fields and fallow land, as well as settlements. Surrounding villages were more affected by deforestation than protected areas, which occupy nearly 45 % of the department's surface area. The rate of deforestation throughout the department was 1.83 %. The rate was 3.10 % in village areas and 0.70 % in protected areas. Thus, 14.96 % of the department's total surface area was affected by deforestation, including more than 20.45 % of village areas and only 7.40 % of protected areas. In addition, 2.66 % of the department was affected by degradation; 1.40 % was naturally restored, and only 0.35 % was improved.

Tropical forests are one of the most affected environments, mainly due to deforestation and poaching. Since high levels of anthropogenic pressure on forest ecosystems, including illegal logging and hunting, occur in southwest Myanmar (Rakhine State), we analyzed the effects of human disturbance on medium to large mammals in this region. We used camera-trapping data collected over three consecutive years to investigate occurrence probabilities of 10 species: five common species exploited for bushmeat consumption, and five threatened species targeted by the illegal wildlife trade. We used a hierarchical single-species multi-season occupancy model implemented in a Bayesian framework to evaluate the effects of human disturbances and persistent habitat characteristics, such as the proportion of remaining pristine evergreen forest and the elevation, on occurrence probabilities. We found that occupancy probabilities of three out of five target species for the illegal wildlife trade were positively linked to forest habitats, whereas among common species hunted for bushmeat consumption the Northern red muntjak and the Malayan porcupine were negatively affected by human presence. The effects of human and habitat covariates were varied for other species of both groups. We confirmed results from previous studies that human disturbance is a driver of occurrence probabilities for some species in tropical areas. Our findings suggest that as protection of rainforest habitat is fundamental to the conservation of tropical ecosystems, law enforcement, patrolling, and local engagement activities are also recommended to mitigate forest and species exploitation. Finally, camera trapping could be a first step to identify areas where human presence affects species occupancy and help local authorities to develop more fine-tuned conservation plans. © 2021 The Authors.

Increased access to previously remote tropical forest following logging and changes in land-use facilitates hunting of elusive wild cattle in Borneo, which preferentially select secluded habitat. We collated the first population parameters for the Endangered Bornean banteng Bos javanicus lowi and developed population models to simulate the effect of different hunting offtake rates on survival and the recovery of the population using reintroduced captive-bred individuals. Our findings suggest that the banteng population in Sabah is geographically divided into 4 management units based on connectivity: the Northeast, Sipitang (West), Central and Southeast, which all require active management to prevent further population decline and local extinction. With only 1% offtake, population growth ceased in the Northeast and Sipitang. In the Southeast and Central units, growth ceased at 2 and 4% offtake, respectively. Extinction was estimated at 21−39 yr when offtake was 5%, occurring first in Sipitang and last in the Central unit. Supplementing the population with captive-bred individuals suggested that inbreeding was likely to limit population growth if using ≤ 20 founder individuals. Translocating 2 individuals for a 10 yr period, starting after 20 yr of captive breeding resulted in a faster population recovery over 100 yr and a lower extinction probability. Our results suggest that shielding the population against further losses from hunting will be key to their survival in the wild, provided that active management in the form of captive breeding is developed in the interim. © 2021","Banteng; Borneo; Bos javanicus lowi; Hunting; Offtake; Population modelling; Tropical forest; Vortex","Goossens, B.; Danau Girang Field Centre, Malaysia; email: GoossensBR@cardiff.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112283356

Data on forest cover and carbon stocks were obtained from the most recent forest resources assessment report by the Food and Agriculture Organization. We performed a regression analysis to obtain parameters and initial values for predicting the forest cover change, where logging was assumed to take place in both natural and plantation forests. Between 2000 and 2020, Southeast Asia lost about 0.5%, or 1.1 million hectares, every year, whilst plantation forests gained 1.8%. Carbon stocks in natural forests declined to 15.7 petagrams of carbon (PgC) in 2030 from 19.7 PgC in 2000. On average, Southeast Asia emits about 468.6 teragrams of carbon dioxide per year (TgCO2 year−1) due to the loss of natural forests and logging, or about 23% of emissions, from tropical forests. Plantation forests gain about 25.9 TgCO2 year−1 between 2000 and 2030. Between 2020 and 2030, Southeast Asia is likely to emit about 442.7 TgCO2 year−1.

Whilst producing an average of 35.1 million cubic metres per year (m3 year−1) of wood products, the adoption of the RIL can result in emission reductions of 96.6 teragrams of carbon dioxide (TgCO2) over a 60-year period. Apart from deforestation, emissions from logging operations were the second-highest source of emissions, indicating that attention should be made to improve the efficiency of logging machinery whilst reducing deforestation and forest degradation.

Secondary forests still had a high number of species and individuals but were dominated by light demanding plants and a low number of uniquely found species. Logged forest and agricultural habitats showed only a low abundance of bird-consumed fruiting plants, being about 2-3 times lower than in primary forests.

However, little is known about the recovery status of these forests. We examined factors that influenced the recovery of forest structural attributes within 50 years after selective logging on Kolombangara Island in the western Solomon Islands. Twelve study sites—six logged and six unlogged—were identified across the Island, with two logged sites in each of three recovery-time classes: 10, 30, and 50 years after logging. Within each study site, 12 0.1-ha plots were randomly established, and a series of forest attributes measured in each plot. Our results revealed that local logging intensity and soil attributes have stronger influence on forest-structural recovery than do site attributes such as local topography or tree architecture. Furthermore, half a century of regeneration following logging is insufficient to permit full recovery of forest structure. We conclude that logged forests on Kolombangara and possibly across the Solomon Islands may not fully recover structurally before the next logging cycle, in the absence of a policy on re-entry harvesting. The development of such a policy coupled with robust forest-management measures is pivotal to facilitating sustainable logging while supporting biodiversity conservation in the Solomon Islands.

Advances in whole forest research, which includes the upper reaches and not just the forest floor, are providing critical information about carbon storage, biodiversity, water cycles, and other essential ecosystem services provided by trees. The methods to study forest canopies are relatively new and vastly underfunded, despite our growing recognition of the global importance of trees. In addition to advancing exploration of the treetops, the forest canopy toolkit is also proving instrumental to jumpstart innovative actions to conserve forest ecosystems. Summary: Forest canopies are home to an estimated 50% of terrestrial biodiversity but remain relatively unexplored until just four decades ago. As one of the first global arbornauts, I share an abbreviated history of canopy science, and how treetop access has inspired forest conservation, especially in the tropics where forests remain relatively unexplored. The arboreal toolkit of ropes and harnesses, canopy walkways, dirigible and inflatable rafts, construction cranes, drones, and LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) has revealed that forests provide many important ecosystem services, essential for life on earth. Yet despite millions of research dollars, extensive time, and extraordinary intellectual capital, the degradation of tropical rain forests is accelerating and does not correlate with the extent of scientific investments. A few case studies illustrate how canopy access methods can inspire innovative approaches to conservation, especially in tropical forests where deforestation is rampant: (a) Use treetop walkways for education and ecotourism, not just research, so that indigenous communities can earn sustainable income without logging; (b) Incorporate citizen scientists into forest field research through BioBlitzes or virtual technologies that are now relatively inexpensive and far-reaching; (c) Inspire girls, especially in low-income countries, to become stewards of their local forests; and (d) Seek diverse stakeholders in forest conservation actions, including religious and corporate leaders. I summarize how treetop exploration can inspire a renaissance in botany, engaging the public about the importance of trees, especially tropical forests and their biodiversity. © 2020 The Author, Plants, People, Planet © New Phytologist Trust","arbornauts; conservation; forest canopy; treetops; tropical rain forests; walkways","Lowman, M.email: canopymeg@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106288347

Time post-management was associated with changes in termite species composition, and wood-feeding termites were more abundant in recently logged areas. Nevertheless, most of the variation in termite species richness and composition can be attributed to the natural variation in soil clay content. Moreover, soil-dweller species, a vulnerable group strongly linked to soil decomposition, were present in all plots. These results suggest that the impact of selective logging on termite communities might be milder compared with other types of disturbance. It is likely that the decomposition process performed by termites, and consequently long-term ecosystem functioning, is preserved under selective logging. © The Author(s), 2021.

In 18 forest plots with different times since logging ended and 9 unlogged forest plots, assessments were conducted on indicators of forest structure and vegetation composition. These indicators were then modelled as a function of management type and plot age. Multivariate ordination was used to visualize forest structure and vegetation composition differences between plots. High vegetation cover in the tree layer was more related to the older RIL and the CL plots, while high vegetation cover in the sapling and seedling layer related more to the CMS and NAT plots. Canopy openness was more related to the NAT, the CMS and the younger RIL plots. Furthermore, the CMS plots, which were logged 30 years ago, still did not reach the basal area of commercially important primary forest species, compared to unlogged forest. Both RIL and CMS plots have a strong presence of secondary species. This study shows the importance of applying the RIL technique correctly and taking forest characteristics and ecological processes into account when developing forest management principles. Forest management systems should also be flexible enough to adapt to area-specific requirements, for example, increasing the rotation cycle if the timber volume is not on the desired level. In this way, both conservation and economic goals are reached. © 2021 The Japanese Forest Society.","Forest dynamics; forest structure; logging techniques; tropical rainforest; vegetation composition","Landburg, G.; National Zoological Collection of Suriname, Suriname; email: gwendolyn.landburg@uvs.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105126533

However, empirical means of estimating the growth characteristics of a removed tree, which will facilitate the conviction of illegal loggers in judicial proceedings, are lacking. This study aimed at developing a model that can predict individual tree slenderness coefficients (SC) from stump diameter (Ds) for Tectona grandis stands in Omo Forest Reserve, Nigeria, for timber valuation in case of illegal felling. Diameter at breast height (DBH; cm), Ds (cm) and total height Ht (m) were measured from all T. grandis stands with a DBH ≥ 5.0 cm, within 35 temporary sample plots (TSPs) randomly laid out in 6 age series (26, 23, 22, 16, 14 and 12 years). The least squares regression method was used to model tree SC from Ds. Six SC-Ds models were fitted and evaluated. The relationship was best described by the single logarithmic function which gave best-fit values for the adjusted coefficient of determination, the Furnival’s index and the standard error of the estimate. This study showed that tree SC estimations were possible even when the only information available was the Ds. The single logarithmic model was validated using independent data and was found to be suitable for estimating the SC of T. grandis stands in Omo Forest Reserve, south-western Nigeria. Future studies should consider developing models for predicting other tree growth variables from Ds. © 2021 NISC (Pty) Ltd.","linear and non-linear models; timber trespass; tree slenderness coefficient; tree stability index; tree stump","Chukwu, O.; Department of Forestry and Wildlife, Nigeria; email: onye20042000@yahoo.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104843911

Among the economic activities that depend on forest resources, timber production is the most important one. Nevertheless, these activities may negatively affect wildlife, the availability of natural resources, and ecosystem process. Here we analysed the effects of low-impact logging on understory bird species richness, number of individuals captured, species composition, and assemblage structure in central Brazilian Amazon. We compared logged and unlogged areas over a period of three years (from August 2014 to May 2017). We captured a total of 180 birds and 42 species (20 families) in the logged area and 226 birds and 49 species (20 families) in the unlogged area. Bird assemblage structure in the logged area changed more intensely over the three years of study and became more similar to the assemblage found in the unlogged area. The degree of similarity (Jaccard’s index) in species composition between logged and unlogged areas increased from 18% in the third year to 39% in the fifth year after logging. The results suggest that the minor effects of low-impact logging were reduced a few years after the disturbance, probably due to ecological succession. The proximity of logged and unlogged areas and the reduced impact in the study site may facilitate the recovery of the bird assemblage after the disturbance. © SISEF.","Biodiversity; Conservation; Environmental Disturbance; Forest Re-sources; Sustainable Development","Cerboncini, R.A.S.; Universidade do Es-tado do Amazonas, Brazil; email: ricardocerboncini@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102961852

However, the complexity of these landscapes makes it difficult to assess abundance and distribution of some species using ground-based surveys alone. Here, we deployed a combination of ground-transects and aerial surveys to determine drivers of the critically endangered Bornean Orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus morio) distribution across a large multiple-use landscape in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Ground-transects and aerial surveys using drones were conducted for orangutan nests and hemi-epiphytic strangler fig trees (Ficus spp.) (an important food resource) in 48 survey areas across 76 km2, within a study landscape of 261 km2 . Orangutan nest count data were fitted to models accounting for variation in land use, above-ground carbon density (ACD, a surrogate for forest quality), strangler fig density, and elevation (between 117 and 675 m). Orangutan nest counts were significantly higher in all land uses possessing natural forest cover, regardless of degradation status, than in monoculture plantations. Within these natural forests, nest counts increased with higher ACD and strangler fig density, but not with elevation. In logged forest (ACD 14–150 Mg ha−1), strangler fig density had a significant, positive relationship with orangutan nest counts, but this relationship disappeared in a forest with higher carbon content (ACD 150–209 Mg ha−1). Based on an area-to-area comparison, orangutan nest counts from ground transects were higher than from counts derived from aerial surveys, but this did not constitute a statistically significant difference. Although the difference in nest counts was not significantly different, this analysis indicates that both methods under-sample the total number of nests present within a given area. Aerial surveys are, therefore, a useful method for assessing the orangutan habitat use over large areas. However, the under-estimation of nest counts by both methods suggests that a small number of ground surveys should be retained in future surveys using this technique, particularly in areas with dense understory vegetation. This study shows that even highly degraded forests may be a suitable orangutan habitat as long as strangler fig trees remain intact after areas of forest are logged. Enrichment planting of strangler figs may, therefore, be a valuable tool for orangutan conservation in these landscapes. © 2021 by the authors.

These perturbations are expected to have strong impacts on ecological interactions and on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. To date, no clear picture of the effects of deforestation on vector-borne disease transmission has emerged. This is associated with the challenge of studying complex systems where many vertebrate hosts and vectors co-exist. To overcome this problem, we focused on an innately simplified system – a small oceanic island (São Tomé, Gulf of Guinea). We analyzed the impacts of human land-use on host-parasite interactions by sampling the bird community (1735 samples from 30 species) in natural and anthropogenic land use at different elevations, and screened individuals for haemosporidian parasites from three genera (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon). Overall, Plasmodium had the highest richness but the lowest prevalence, while Leucocytozoon diversity was the lowest despite having the highest prevalence. Interestingly, co-infections (i.e. intra-host diversity) involved primarily Leucocytozoon lineages (95%). We also found marked differences between bird species and habitats. Some bird species showed low prevalence but harbored high diversity of parasites, while others showed high prevalence but were infected with fewer lineages. These infection dynamics are most likely driven by host specificity of parasites and intrinsic characteristics of hosts. In addition, Plasmodium was more abundant in disturbed habitats and at lower elevations, while Leucocytozoon was more prevalent in forest areas and at higher elevations. These results likely reflect the ecological requirements of their vectors: mosquitoes and black flies, respectively. © 2020 Australian Society for Parasitology","Anthropogenic changes; Avian haemosporidian epizootiology; Deforestation; Landscape parasitology; Vector-borne disease","Loiseau, C.; CIBIO – Research Center in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources, Portugal; email: claire.loiseau@cibio.up.pt",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095588232

However, population growth, increas-ing demand for agricultural products and land use changes are affecting their sustainability. This thesis aimed to develop a multi-dimen-sional approach to assess forest degradation and how it is related to land use dynamics, in order to estimate forest vulnerability. The studies for this thesis were conducted in Paragomi-nas (Brazil) and Di Linh (Vietnam). In Parago-minas, forest degradation is directly linked to selective logging and forest fires, which alter the structure of forests. We used remote sensing tools and data on carbon stocks to map aerial forest biomass, and investigated the consequences of degradation on forest struc-ture. We observed that 58% of forest degradation was accounted for by changes in land use. The distribution of degraded forests is driven by their fragmentation due to the expansion of soya cultivation, but is also associated with recent deforestation and slash-and-burn prac-tices. In Di Linh, forest degradation is due to encroachment by coffee plantations. By com-bining an inventory of different types of land use with Sentinel-2 images, we were able to map current land cover. We then built up the trajectories of landscape dynamics to charac-terise the expansion of the agricultural frontier. We identified the degradation and fragmentation trajectories that produce effects of greater or lesser intensity on the forest cover. Taken together, these indicators bring out vulnerability hotspots. Thanks to the remote sensing approaches and indicators developed for forests on the landscape scale, we were able to provide a holistic diagnosis of forests within landscapes altered by humans. This thesis aims to open up avenues for appropriate and priority management of degraded forests on the scale of the landscape.

The specific objectives were to: i) determine the extent of land cover changes in the urban forest, and ii) ascertain the factors driving land cover changes in the urban forest. The study employed Landsat satellite images using ENVI to detect trends of land cover changes from 1991 to 2015. A questionnaire survey was used to solicit information on the socio-economic drivers of land cover changes from households in four fringe communities of the urban forest. The results showed that built up and bare areas recorded an increase between 1991 and 2015, with a decline in forests as well as shrubs and grasslands. The study showed that, forest decreased from 387.83 ha in 1991 to 341.28 ha in 2015, indicating a class change of 12.0%. Shrubs and grassland also decreased from 24.56 ha in 1991 to 11.77 ha in 2015, representing a class change of 52.1%. Built-up and bare areas changed from 36.278 ha in 1991 to 95.618 ha in 2015, representing class change of 163.57%. Overall, the study established that 59.34 ha of the Achimota Forest Reserve has been lost or converted to built-up and bare areas between 1991 and 2015. Study respondents identified urbanisation as the most important cause of land cover change. Other factors driving land cover changes reported included fuel wood harvesting and logging, agriculture, lack of forest guards, a lack of enforcement of laws on forest and annual fires. Based on these findings, the study concluded that human activities were driving considerable land cover changes in the urban forest. These changes could have significant implications for the long-term sustainability of the urban forest. Therefore, the study recommended that government takes steps to protect the urban forest from further land cover changes, as built up and bare areas have increased by more than double its size since 1991. © 2020 The Author(s)","Ghana; Land cover changes; Landsat; Socio-economic drivers; Urban forest; Urbanisation","Antwi-Agyei, P.; Department of Environmental Science, Private Mail Bag, University Post Office, Ghana; email: pantwi-agyei.sci@knust.edu.gh",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102581304

However, these studies did not account for detectability or habitat associations in sustainably managed forest reserves. Here, we determined detectability and species habitat relationships in stream amphibians within the Deramakot forest reserve, a reduced impact logging concession in the Malaysian state of Sabah, northern Borneo. We analyzed data for 10 stream species collected along 32 stream transects. An occupancy modeling framework was used to determine the climatological, temporal, and environmental covariates associated with detection and occupancy probabilities. We identified high variability in detection probability between species, including significant associations with moon phase (six species), time since sunset (five species), humidity (five species), rainfall (four species), and temperature (three species). Stream slope and volume provided by far the best predictors of occurrence, with significant positive or negative associations with the occupancy of six species each. These associations were more similar to those found in pristine compared with conventionally logged habitats. The highly variable detectability associations within our amphibian community suggest a level of temporal separation in regard to activity and breeding phenology in these species. This stresses the importance of accounting for detection probability via surveying sites across varying climatic/temporal conditions to obtain a representative sample of amphibian communities in pristine and disturbed tropical forests. © Copyright 2020 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.",,"Asad, S.; Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, Invalidenstraβe 43, Germany; email: sami.asad@mfn.berlin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098649621

We measured soil CO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes, and their soil controlling factors at two forests that had undergone conventional selective logging and reduced-impact logging in Cameroon. Each logging system had four replicate plots, each included the disturbed strata (road, logging deck, skidding trail, and felling gap) and an undisturbed reference area. Measurements were conducted monthly from September 2016 to October 2017. Annual GHG fluxes ranged from 4.9 to 18.6 Mg CO2–C, from 1.5 to 79 kg N2O–N, and from − 4.3 to 71.1 kg CH4–C ha−1 year−1. Compared to undisturbed areas, soil CO2 emissions were reduced and soil CH4 emissions increased in skidding trails, logging decks and roads (P &lt; 0.01) whereas soil N2O emissions increased in skidding trails (P = 0.03–0.05). The combined disturbed strata had 28% decrease in soil CO2 emissions, 83% increase in soil N2O emissions, and seven times higher soil CH4 emissions compared to undisturbed area (P ≤ 0.01). However, the disturbed strata represented only 4–5% of the area impacted in both logging systems, which reduced considerably the changes in soil GHG fluxes at the landscape level. Across all strata, soil GHG fluxes were regulated by soil bulk density and water-filled pore space, indicating the influence of soil aeration and gas diffusion, and by soil organic carbon and nitrogen, suggesting the control of substrate availability on microbial processes of these GHG. © 2020, The Author(s).","Ferralsols; Selective logging; Soil CH4 fluxes; Soil CO2 emissions; Soil N2O emissions; Tropical forest","Tchiofo Lontsi, R.; Soil Science of Tropical and Subtropical Ecosystems, Buesgenweg 2, Germany; email: rtchiof@gwdg.de",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094890242

We investigated the effects of selective logging on the phylogenetic and functional diversity (FD) of Amazonian forest avifauna. We sampled the overall and the understorey bird community using point counts and mist-netting, respectively, in logged and unlogged forests. The overall bird community showed significantly lower phylogenetic diversity (PD) and FD in logged than unlogged forests, but significantly higher standard effect size (ses) of PD, ses mean pairwise distance (MPD), mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD), ses functional MPD (sesfMPD) and functional MNTD (fMNTD) in logged sites. Evolutionary distinctiveness, sesMPD, sesFD, fMNTD and sesfMNTD of understorey birds were significantly higher in logged forests. Higher logging intensity affected some metrics negatively and others positively, although the relatively small changes in phylogenetic and FD suggest limited overall effects from logging at lower intensity. In combination, selective logging brings deleterious effects for some components of phylogenetic and FD of the overall Amazonian bird community. Nonetheless, selectively logged forests retain important avian diversity, underscoring their high conservation value. Relatively, low impacts of selective logging may be due to the reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques used, high connectivity with well-preserved unlogged forests or focus on short-term logging impacts. Because even low-intensity RIL causes some losses in evolutionary history and functional traits, an optimal approach for conserving phylogenetic and FD requires incorporating some land-sparing logging to protect more old-growth patches within the logged matrix. © 2020 The Zoological Society of London","Amazon forest birds; Amazonian bird communities; forestry; functional diversity; phylogenetic diversity; selective logging; sustainable forest management; tropical forests","Mestre, L.A.M.; Laboratório de Ornitologia, Brazil; email: luiz.mestre@ufpr.br",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085150954

Changes in forest cover affect forest structure, composition and functioning, but little is known about how such changes influence the belowground carbon content. In this study, we addressed this issue by evaluating whether fine-root production differed between forest-cover types and contrasting seasons after controlling arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) traits, and what the minimum time required to detect such differences is. We also determined whether AMF-related traits were affected by distinct forest cover and seasons after controlling fine-root production. The objects of study were four forests with distinct degradation histories in the Atlantic Forest: Old-growth, Post-selective logging, Post-clear-cut and Post-pasture forests. Data were collected in four 2500-m2 plots installed in each area and analyzed through multivariate statistics. Fine-root production differed significantly between forest covers, and marginally between seasons, as it was greater in the post-pasture area and in the rainy season. Some AMF traits also differed between forest covers and seasons, especially the abundance of viable spores in the dry season. We found that the shortest period necessary to identify differences in the production of fine roots was over three months. This study shows that forests with different degradation histories and annual climatic variations significantly affect fine-root production and AMF dynamics in Tropical Montane Forests. In particular, ecosystems that have been more perturbed tend to invest more in fine-root production (post-pasture).

We used a phylogenetic approach to capture changes on the evolutionary diversity, structure and composition of 72-one-hectare forest subplots in East Kalimantan that were logged using conventional (CL) and reduced-impact (RIL) techniques, including post-logging silvicultural interventions by reducing stem density (thinning), shortly after (on average 18 months) and 10 years after treatments. Both CL and RIL techniques initially decreased phylogenetic diversity, but after a decade of succession the phylogenetic diversity levels were no longer different from unlogged forests (Controls). Thinning through poison-notching non-commercial trees led to an increase in phylogenetic diversity after a decade of succession. Mean evolutionary relatedness, as measured by the Net Relatedness Index, initially decreased in logged forests, possibly because of harvest of closely related dipterocarp species, but returned to initial levels after a decade. Regardless of silvicultural interventions 10 years after logging had no effect on the mean evolutionary relatedness of the trees in the communities at both time intervals. Both CL and RIL techniques increased the phylogenetic composition dissimilarity with unlogged forest, with increasing logging intensity resulting in increasingly larger effects, although the changes were smaller for RIL. Phylogenetic composition only became dissimilar from unlogged forest after a decade of succession, when the logging intensity was above 4 m2 ha−1 for both CL and RIL, equivalent to 8 trees ha−1 or 68 m3 ha−1. Post-logging silvicultural interventions started to cause changes in phylogenetic composition when the basal area was reduced by thinning by more than 10 m2 ha−1. The rapid recovery of phylogenetic diversity, community structure and, to a lesser extent composition after logging and thinning confirms that tropical forests are resilient to a single logging cycle. With low-intensity logging of less than 4 m2 ha−1, RIL techniques appear to facilitate phylogenetic structure and compositional recovery to levels not different from unlogged forest after 10 years of succession, especially when combined with post-logging silvicultural intervention with a basal area reduction by thinning of less than 10 m2 ha−1. However, it remains to be seen whether forests will respond similarly to a second logging cycle. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Forest recovery; Logging effects; Phylogenetic composition; Phylogenetic diversity; Phylogenetic structure; Post-logging silvicultural interventions effects","Mahayani, N.P.D.; Faculty of Forestry, Jalan Agro No. 1 Bulaksumur, Indonesia; email: diana.mahayani@ugm.ac.id",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089105207

However, few studies have investigated the long-term impacts of thinning regimes on the growth responses of tropical timber species. In this study, we analysed data collected over a period of 46 years to assess the long-term growth responses and growth patterns of remnant trees of three key commercial species (Flindersia brayleyana F. Muell., Flindersia bourjotiana F. Muell. and Flindersia pimenteliana F. Muell.). We also examined how initial tree size, crown size and crown position within canopy, and neighbourhood competition affected growth rates of the three Flindersia species. Within these species, we assessed growth responses of trees above 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) in an Australian tropical rainforest, to different intensities of thinning i.e. logging only as a control and low-, medium- and high-intensity thinning (L, LT, MT and HT, respectively). Medium and high intensity treatments facilitated recruitment of all three Flindersia species into the >10 cm DBH class while medium intensity thinning resulted in the greatest average annual basal area increments (BAIs). The lower individual BAI of Flindersia species in HT was due to fewer large Flindersia trees remaining after thinning, combined with large numbers of recruits and slow growth of small remnant trees. BAI in HT increased initially, with a peak during 1981–1989 and then decreased. BAI was constant and varied little over time within the other treatments. High intensity thinning had prolonged impacts on the growth patterns of Flindersia trees over 46 years. Tree initial DBH, crown size and crown position within canopy explained most variation in individual BAIs of Flindersia trees. Both thinning intensity and measurement periods explained variation in individual BAIs of Flindersia trees. Larger remnant Flindersia trees with broad and dominant crowns tended to grow faster. BAIs of individual trees were negatively correlated with neighbourhood competition. If the goal of tropical native forest management is to improve productivity of target species, the results indicate that thinning should be sufficiently intense to reduce neighbourhood competition while maintaining large diameter commercially desirable trees with large and dominant crowns, which may consequently facilitate the timber volume and above-ground biomass recovery after selective logging. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Neighbourhood competition; Recruitment; Selective logging; Silviculture; Tree crown; Tree growth rate; Tree size; Tropical forest","Hu, J.; School of Agriculture and Food Sciences, Australia; email: jhu@usc.edu.au",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088913956

This has sparked scientific debate on how to achieve natural climate solutions. Central to this debate is whether sustainably managing forests and protected areas will deliver global climate mitigation benefits, while ensuring local peoples’ health and well-being. Here, we evaluate the 10-y impact of a human-centered solution to achieve natural climate mitigation through reductions in illegal logging in rural Borneo: an intervention aimed at expanding health care access and use for communities living near a national park, with clinic discounts offsetting costs historically met through illegal logging. Conservation, education, and alternative livelihood programs were also offered. We hypothesized that this would lead to improved health and well-being, while also alleviating illegal logging activity within the protected forest. We estimated that 27.4 km2 of deforestation was averted in the national park over a decade (∼70% reduction in deforestation compared to a synthetic control, permuted P = 0.038). Concurrently, the intervention provided health care access to more than 28,400 unique patients, with clinic usage and patient visitation frequency highest in communities participating in the intervention. Finally, we observed a dose–response in forest change rate to intervention engagement (person-contacts with intervention activities) across communities bordering the park: The greatest logging reductions were adjacent to the most highly engaged villages. Results suggest that this community-derived solution simultaneously improved health care access for local and indigenous communities and sustainably conserved carbon stocks in a protected tropical forest. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

We then compared some leaf and stem functional traits of 15-18-month-old resprouts and nearby conspecific saplings of the same height (0.5-3.5 m) but unknown age. Stumps of Dicorynia guianensis Amsh. (29-103 cm in diameter) produced the most sprouts (x = 9.2/stump), followed by the 50-71 cm diameter stumps of Eperua falcata Amsh. (10.6/stump), and the 30-78 cm diameter Qualea rosea Amsh. (5.9/stump); sprout density did not vary with stump diameter. Sprouts emerged from the lower, middle, and upper thirds of the stumps of all three species, but not from the vicinity of the exposed vascular cambium in Qualea. With increased resprout density, heights of the tallest sprout per stump tended to increase but height:diameter ratios increased only in Dicorynia. Compared to conspecific saplings, sprouts displayed higher height-diameter ratios, higher leaf-to-wood mass ratios (LWR), and lower wood densities, but did not differ in leaf mass per unit area (LMA) or leaf water contents. These acquisitive functional traits may reflect increased resprout access to water and nutrients via the extensive root system of the stump. That we did not encounter live stump sprouts from the previous round of selective logging, approximately 25 years before our study, suggests that stump sprouts in our study area grow rapidly but do not live long. © 2020 by the authors.","Allometry; Coppicing; Sprout biomass; Tree height:diameter ratios; Tropical forestry","Putz, F.E.; Department of Biology, P.O.

This raises the question of whether management for restoration represents an economically viable alternative. We reviewed restoration concessions (areas of degraded state forest land leased to enterprises on long-term [≥60-year] licenses for restoration-compatible business development) in Indonesia since their introduction in 2004 and found that, although many opportunities and actions are being explored, business models remain largely aspirational. Costs – including those associated with taxes and reporting, forest protection, community development, and restoration interventions – are high, while developing revenues at sufficient scale from carbon markets, non-timber forest products, and ecosystem services is challenging. Potential solutions include the development of restoration-compatible revenue streams and value-added processing to generate income, investment in communities to bring them in as partners in restoration enterprises, and creation of a supportive regulatory environment by reducing statutory costs and eliminating perverse regulations. Restoration concessions are a scalable policy option for promoting private investment in restoration that could be replicated internationally to help meet ambitious global restoration targets. © 2020 The Authors.

The only feasible data sources for near real-time monitoring over large area are remote sensing data, and historically the only sensors with repeat times sufficient for near-real time monitoring are from coarse-resolution sensors such as MODIS. The MODIS sensors onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites have provided near daily global observations in the red and NIR spectral bands at 250 m resolution since 1999. While their longevity is impressive, the sensors are nearing the end of their lifespan and the MODIS data record will be continued by the VIIRS sensor onboard Suomi NPP. But because of the spatial and spectral differences between MODIS and VIIRS, it is worth investigating whether VIIRS can replace MODIS as input data for near real-time monitoring. In this article, we compared the performance of the NRT-CCDC (Near Real-Time Continuous Change Detection and Classification) algorithm using the Terra/ and Aqua/MODIS composites at 250 m resolution, Terra/MODIS 250 m and 500 m surface reflectance, Aqua/MODIS 250 m and 500 m surface reflectance, and VIIRS 500 m surface reflectance. We found that the algorithm using composites from both MODIS sensors and Terra/MODIS data at 250 m resolution outperformed the results obtained when using VIIRS data. The results were similar when using 500 m data from Terra/MODIS alone compared to VIIRS data. We found that a morning overpass, like that of Terra, is preferable to an afternoon overpass, which is employed by VIIRS and Aqua.

A large body of literature shows changes in species abundance distributions (SADs) after disturbances in many systems and suggests that SADs are a useful tool for monitoring community recovery after impacts. We used Poisson lognormal distribution to described SAD, which has sigma and correlation parameters, for comparing species diversity before logging and over time. Sigma is a measure of alpha diversity and correlation expresses similarity between communities. Contrary to our expectations, we detected no changes for sigma, but correlation showed a decreasing trend, particularly after the first decade. Those changes were due to the increase in the abundance of pioneers and little recruitment of commercial species. Mortality was mainly attributed to the accidental death of non-targeted individuals. Because of the dominant role of random accidental tree deaths, the signature of logging operations was not detected immediately after logging using sigma. Forest management did not cause changes in the abundance structure of communities if we disregard species composition. However, considering species composition, and particularly, which species were common or rare, we did detect changes over time. The trends we have detected might be an early warning of a stronger long term tendency, which could affect abundance distributions. Due to the long lifecycle of trees and their slow growth rate, longer-term studies are needed to understand the impacts of logging on tropical forests. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Forest dynamics; Poisson lognormal; Similarity; Species abundance distribution","Naves, R.P.; Departamento de Ciências Florestais, Av.

Understanding regeneration in degraded landscapes is crucial to decision-making and predicting the outcome of passive or active restoration actions. We aimed to understand the effects of intensifying fire regimes on post-fire natural regeneration in sites degraded by logging and fire in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We studied five areas with different fire regimes (i.e., different fire frequencies and post-fire regeneration time), dominated by Moquiniastrum polymorphum (Asteraceae), a widely-distributed species with fire resistance traits. We analyzed differences in structure, diversity, the amplitude of the species' geographic distribution, and floristic composition. We recorded Leaf Area Index and grass cover to understand the effect of canopy closure on fire exclusion and analyzed functional traits related to succession and response to fire (specific leaf area, height, wood density, bark thickness, seed mass). Post-fire regeneration was slow and fire-prone and dominance by M. polymorphum decreased with less disturbance, as other species entered the communities. Structure, diversity, and functional composition recovered along the gradient but did not reach old-growth values. The taxonomic composition was strikingly different in burned areas and forests, irrespective of fire history. Natural regeneration followed a divergent trajectory, marked by the establishment of other widely-distributed species, which suggests a long-term floristic impoverishment. The establishment of M. polymorphum allows these pastures to exit grass-fire cycles. Longer post-fire recovery and fewer fire events allow for canopy closure, grass exclusion, and eventually fire suppression. This two-step dynamic breaks a crucial barrier for restoration from degraded pastures and represents a more desirable state than pastures. However, relying only upon natural regeneration results in impoverished secondary forests. Given the pervasive effects of deforestation and fire, natural regeneration observed in tropical landscapes may correspond to impoverished new secondary forests that fail to attain conservation targets for the biome. Preventing future fires and controlling grass cover in the understory is crucial to avoid their retrogression to pastures and to treat them as regeneration templates for active restoration. © Copyright © 2020 Sánchez-Tapia, Sansevero, Garbin, Braga, Figueiredo and Scarano.","Brazilian Atlantic Forest; dominance shifts; fire in tropical forests; monodominance; novel forests; savannization; tropical secondary forests","Sánchez-Tapia, A.; Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botânico do Rio de JaneiroBrazil; email: andreasancheztapia@jbrj.gov.br",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102296398

Such impacts are poorly quantified to date due to difficulties in accessing and maintaining observational infrastructures, as well as the lack of proper modeling tools for capturing the interactions among biophysical properties, ecosystem demography, canopy structure, and biogeochemical cycling in tropical forests. As a first step to address these limitations, we implemented a selective logging module into the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES) by mimicking the ecological, biophysical, and biogeochemical processes following a logging event. The model can specify the timing and aerial extent of logging events, splitting the logged forest patch into disturbed and intact patches; determine the survivorship of cohorts in the disturbed patch; and modifying the biomass and necromass (total mass of coarse woody debris and litter) pools following logging. We parameterized the logging module to reproduce a selective logging experiment at the Tapajós National Forest in Brazil and benchmarked model outputs against available field measurements. Our results suggest that the model permits the coexistence of early and late successional functional types and realistically characterizes the seasonality of water and carbon fluxes and stocks, the forest structure and composition, and the ecosystem succession following disturbance. However, the current version of FATES overestimates water stress in the dry season and therefore fails to capture seasonal variation in latent and sensible heat fluxes. Moreover, we observed a bias towards low stem density and leaf area when compared to observations, suggesting that improvements are needed in both carbon allocation and establishment of trees. The effects of logging were assessed by different logging scenarios to represent reduced impact and conventional logging practices, both with high and low logging intensities. The model simulations suggest that in comparison to old-growth forests the logged forests rapidly recover water and energy fluxes in 1 to 3 years. In contrast, the recovery times for carbon stocks, forest structure, and composition are more than 30 years depending on logging practices and intensity. This study lays the foundation to simulate land use change and forest degradation in FATES, which will be an effective tool to directly represent forest management practices and regeneration in the context of Earth system models. © 2020 Royal Society of Chemistry.

Scientific forest management (SciFM) is a popular management approach that is increasingly adopted in Sal (Shorea robusta) dominated forests of Nepal, aiming to accelerate timber production and to improve forest condition. Being based on specific management plan, SciFM practices involve application of various silvicultural practices to manipulate forest composition and stand structure referring to the whole rotation period of a particular forest stand. Of the various aspects of SciFM, we aim to quantify the effect of SciFM on species diversity and regeneration dynamics, and compare diversity indices and regeneration attributes between managed and unmanaged forest stand in lowlands of Nepal, through establishment of permanent sample plots and its measurement in 2014 and 2018. Data collection about plant species and regeneration attributes was carried out in 50 sample plots of size 10 m × 10 m, established by stratified random sampling using quadrat method. Data analysis was done by using various diversity indices and compared through paired t-test. We also carried out correlation and regression analysis of diversity indices with predictor variables; such as canopy cover, number of individuals ha−1, basal area ha−1 and site productivity index. Our study found that plant diversity is significantly decreased but the concentration of dominance is significantly increased in managed forest blocks. Diversity indices were found to have a higher degree of relationship with number of individuals ha−1 and canopy cover as compared to site productivity index and basal area ha−1. Similarly, seedling density and sapling density is found to be increased in managed blocks, ensuring the production and productivity of forest stand sustainably. Based on our analysis, we argue that opening of canopy through regeneration felling is important in promoting regeneration establishment and growth but further research is needed to balance the species diversity along with the practice of intensive management interventions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Diversity indices; Logging intensity; Regeneration growth; Shorea robusta; Silvicultural system","Aryal, K.; Ministry of Industry, Nepal; email: syangjali999@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087704449

However, most tropical forests, especially Borneo’s forests in Southeast Asia, are under intense pressure and threatened by human acti-vities such as logging, mining, agriculture and conversion to industrial plantations. Selective logging is known to reduce both above-and below-ground biomass by removing selected large trees, while increasing deadwood stocks through collateral logging damage and creating large gaps in the canopy. The extent of inciden-tal damage, canopy opening and the rate of C recovery were shown to be primarily related to logging intensity. This thesis assesses the long-term effects of logging intensity on five main C pools in Dipterocarp forests in northern Borneo (Malinau District, North Kalimantan) along a logging intensity gradient ranging from 0 to 57% of initial biomass removed in 1999/2000. Our results showed that total C stocks 16 years after logging ranged from 218-554 Mg C/ha with an average of 314 Mg C/ha. A difference of 95 Mg C/ha was found between low logging intensity (&lt; 2.1% of initial biomass lost) and high logging intensity (&gt; 19%). Most C (approx. 77%) was found in living trees, followed by soil (15%), deadwood (6%) and a small fraction in litter (1%). The imprint of logging intensity was still detectable 16 years after logging. Logging intensity was thus shown to be the main driver explaining the reduction of AGC&gt;20, BGC&gt;20, in deadwood and total C stocks and an increase in deadwood. Our results quantify the long-term effects of logging on forest C stocks, especially in AGC and deadwood. High logging intensity (50% reduction of initial biomass) reduced total C stocks by 27%. AGC recovery was lower in high logging intensity plots, suggesting lowered forest resilience to logging. Our study showed that keeping logging intensity below 20% of the initial biomass can limit the long-term effects of logging on AGC and deadwood stocks. © Cirad Date de publication: 1er novembre 2020.","Above-ground biomass; Below-ground biomass; Borneo; Deadwood; Dipterocarp forests; Litter; Soil organic carbon; Tropical logged forests","Rozak, A.H.; CIRAD, France; email: andes.hamuraby.rozak@lipi.go.id

Termites occurred in the heartwoods of 43% of the trees, with Coptotermes testaceus the most abundant species. Background and Objectives: Hollows and rotten cores in the stems of living trees have ecological and economic impacts in forests managed for timber. The decision on whether to cut or maintain hollow trees in such forests must account for the susceptibility of different tree species to decay. We investigated tree and wood characteristics of living trees of five commercial timber species in the eastern Amazon that influenced the likelihood of heartwood decay and the occurrence of termite nests inside the rotten cores. Materials and Methods: We used Pearson’s correlations and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to explore relationships among tree basal area and hollow area. We used principal components analysis (PCA) to analyze the variation of wood anatomical traits, followed by a linear regression to explore the relationships between PCA scores, and heartwood hollow area. We used a logistic model to investigate if the probability the occurrence of colonies of C. testaceus inside tree cores varied with tree and species characteristics. Results: Heartwood hollow areas increased with stem basal area. Larger hollows were more likely to occur in species with higher vessel and ray densities, and smaller diameter vessels. Termites occurred in the hollows of 43% of the trees sampled, with C. testaceus the most common (76%). The probability of encountering termite nests of C. testaceus varied among tree species and was positively related to wood density. Conclusions: This study shows that given the increased likelihood of stem hollows and rotten cores in large trees, tree selection criteria in managed tropical forests should include maximum cutting sizes that vary with the susceptibility of different tree species to stem decay. © 2020 by the authors.

Since forest change can relate to processes ranging from high-impact, large-scale conversion to low-impact, selective logging, and can occur in sites having variable topographic and environmental properties such as mountain slopes and wetlands, a single approach is insufficient. The system introduced here combines time-series analysis of small objects identified in S1 data, i.e., segments containing linear features and apparent small-scale disturbances. A physical model is introduced for quantifying the size of small (upper-) canopy gaps. Deforestation detection was evaluated for several forest landscapes in the Amazon and Borneo. Using the default system settings, the false alarm rate (FAR) is very low (less than 1%), and the missed detection rate (MDR) varies between 1.9% ± 1.1% and 18.6% ± 1.0% (90% confidence level). For peatland landscapes, short radar detection delays up to several weeks due to high levels of soil moisture may occur, while, in comparison, for optical systems, detection delays up to 10 months were found due to cloud cover. In peat swamp forests, narrow linear canopy gaps (road and canal systems) could be detected with an overall accuracy of 85.5%, including many gaps barely visible on hi-res SPOT-6/7 images, which were used for validation. Compared to optical data, subtle degradation signals are easier to detect and are not quickly lost over time due to fast re-vegetation. Although it is possible to estimate an effective forest-cover loss, for example, due to selective logging, and results are spatiotemporally consistent with Sentinel-2 and TerraSAR-X reference data, quantitative validation without extensive field data and/or large hi-res radar datasets, such as TerraSAR-X, remains a challenge. © 2020 by the authors.

In the Brazilian Amazon forest degradation from August 2006 to July 2016 reached 1,1 869 800 ha. The processes of forest degradation are still poorly understood, being a missing component in anthropogenic CO2 emission estimates in tropical forests. In this work, we analyzed temporal trajectories of forest degradation from August 2006 to July 2016 in the Brazilian Amazon and assessed their impact on the regional carbon balance. We combined the degradation process with deforestation-related processes (clear-cut deforestation and secondary vegetation dynamics), using the spatially-explicit INPE-EM carbon emission model. The trajectory analysis showed that 13% of the degraded area ended up being cleared and converted in the period and 61% of the total degraded area experienced only one event of degradation throughout the whole period. Net emissions added up to 5.4 GtCO2, considering the emissions from forest degradation and deforestation, absorption from degraded forest recovery, and secondary vegetation dynamics. The results show an increase in the contribution of forest degradation to net emissions towards the end of the period, related to the decrease in clear-cut deforestation rates, decoupled from the forest degradation rates. The analysis also indicates that the regeneration of degraded forests absorbed 1.8 GtCO2 from August 2006 and July 2016- A component typically overlooked in the regional carbon balance. © 2020 The Author(s).

With the rapid expansion of commercial land use into tropical forest regions, the urgency and importance to integrate equity issues in space and time in decisions and actions stand without doubt. However, data scarcity in these regions limits the understanding of factors that affect spatial and temporal aspects of equity. This again emphasizes the need of rapid and robust ways to address spatio-temporal patterns of equity that are especially suited for data-scarce regions. This study addresses this gap. We assess the factors that have an influence on spatial equity through an empirical study that compares two sub-regions in the Upper Suriname River Basin. In the first sub-region, some logging and road building occur; the other, however, is more remote and such interventions are not yet developed but merely planned. We collected spatial data for 1995 and 2015 using a participatory GIS survey (n = 493), registering provisioning service hotspots. We then explored spatial equity, according to clan and authority position, by analyzing variation over time and across regions in relation to access capabilities of these users. In the region with roads and logging, spatial equity concerns emerged over time regarding the provision of timber and fish. In the remote region, spatial inequity in access to fish provisioning hotspots of ecosystem services increased while it showed a decreasing trend for timber. In outlining spatial equity concerns, we argue that spatial equity analysis unveils an essential social dimension in the use of the space that is integral in spatial planning processes in data scarce forest regions under external pressures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Conflicted space; Ecosystem services; External pressures; Participatory GIS; Service-provisioning hotspots; Spatial equity","Ramirez-Gomez, S.O.I.; Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Vening Meineszgebouw A, Princetonlaan 8a, Netherlands; email: soi.sararamirez@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088383971

Here we determine the distribution, drivers and threats to large trees and high carbon forest. Location: Central Africa. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Trees. Methods: Using Gabon's new National Resource Inventory of 104 field sites, AGC was calculated from 67,466 trees from 578 species and 97 genera. Power and Michaelis–Menten models assessed the contribution of large trees to AGC. Environmental and anthropogenic drivers of AGC, large trees, and stand variables were modelled using Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) weights to calculate average regression coefficients for all p. ossible models. Results: Mean AGC for trees ≥ 10 cm DBH in Gabonese forestlands was 141.7 Mg C/ha, with averages of 166.6, 171.3 and 96.6 Mg C/ha in old growth, concession and secondary forest. High carbon forests occurred where large trees are most abundant: 31% of AGC was stored in large trees (2.3% of all stems). Human activities largely drove variation in AGC and large trees, but climate and edaphic conditions also determined stand variables (basal area, tree height, wood density, stem density). AGC and large trees increased with distance from human settlements; AGC was 40% lower in secondary than primary and concession forests and 33% higher in protected than non-managed areas. Main conclusions: AGC and large trees were negatively associated with human activities, highlighting the importance of forest management. Redefining large trees as ≥ 50 cm DBH (4.3% more stems) would account for 20% more AGC. This study demonstrates that protecting relatively undisturbed forests can be disproportionately effective in conserving carbon and suggests that including sustainable forestry in programs like reduced emissions for deforestation and forest degradation could maintain carbon dense forests in logging concessions that are a large proportion of remaining Central African forests. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aboveground biomass; carbon; Central Africa; climate change; Gabon; large trees; tree height; tropical forest; wood density","Poulsen, J.R.; Nicholas School of the Environment, United States; email: john.poulsen@duke.edu

A key unresolved question is understanding which physiological mechanisms underlie different responses of species and functional groups to selective logging. Regulation of oxidative status is thought to be one major physiological mechanism underlying the capability of species to cope with environmental changes. Using a correlational cross-sectional approach, we compared a number of oxidative status markers among 15 understorey bird species in unlogged and selectively logged forest in Borneo in relation to their feeding guild. We then tested how variation of markers between forest types was associated with that in population abundance. Birds living in logged forests had a higher activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase and a different regulation of the glutathione cycle compared to conspecific birds in unlogged forest. However, neither oxidative damage nor oxidized glutathione differed between forest types. We also found that omnivores and insectivores differed significantly in all markers related to the key cellular antioxidant glutathione irrespective of the forest type. Species with higher levels of certain antioxidant markers in a given type of forest were less abundant in that forest type compared to the other. Our results suggest that there was little long-term effect of logging (last logging rotation occurred ~15 years prior to the study) on the oxidative status of understorey bird species. However, it is unclear if this was owing to plasticity or evolutionary change. Our correlative results also point to a potential negative association between some antioxidants and population abundance irrespective of the forest type. © 2020 British Ecological Society","antioxidant; canalization; feeding ecology; forest degradation; land-use change; oxidative status; selective logging","Messina, S.; Behavioural Ecology & Ecophysiology Group, Belgium; email: simone.messina@uantwerpen.be",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087835276

However, there is a high degree of complexity due to the number of variables involved. Among these infrastructures, wood storage yards are of utmost importance as they directly influence the opening of forest roads and trails. The objective of this research was to evaluate the allocation of wood storage yards through exact solution and metaheuristics in a forest management area. The study area was a native forest under sustainable forest management regime located in the Brazilian Amazon. Three instances were formulated involving 5947 trees and 3172 wood storage yards facilities. We used a binary integer programming model solved by CPLEX and the metaheuristics Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), Tabu Search (TS), Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and Simulated Annealing (SA). GAP values increased as a function of instances. Although all metaheuristics obtained significant solutions with shorter processing times, only SA obtained feasible solutions in all executions for all three instances. In general, the metaheuristics were efficient in obtaining feasible solutions faster than CPLEX, which represents the feasibility of the planning of allocation storage large areas, and without significant losses of best-known solution. The SA presented the best performance in the three evaluated instances. Contribution of this study can be highlighted: evaluation of alternative computational methods for planning the allocation of wooden storage yards; evidence was obtained of effectiveness and efficiency of assessed metaheuristics and, the applicability of approximate methods in this problem was evaluated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Geographic information system; Metaheuristics; Optimized planning; Tropical forest","Aguiar, M.O.; Federal University of Espírito Santo/UFES, Avenue Governor Lindemberg; 316, Brazil; email: marcelo.aguiar@ufes.br",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086826870

Globally, the expanding conversion of natural tropical forest to plantations in recent decades, to meet economic demands, has markedly influenced the cycling of soil organic carbon (SOC) pools; however, the mechanisms underlying the changes in SOC dynamics are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the SOC dynamics and soil microbial communities at five adjacent tropical forest sites characterized by different logging and plantation practices over the past few decades on Hainan Island, China, by applying natural abundance radiocarbon (14C) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. At a &gt;35-year rubber plantation site and a &gt;50-year eucalyptus plantation site, an abnormal up-profile decrease in radiocarbon abundance was observed in the upper 30 cm soil layer. This could be indicative of continued soil organic matter decomposition long after forest–plantation conversion, and was consistent with the SOC inventories in the upper 30 cm soil layer at the two sites being significantly lower than those of NF. Both the SOC apparent radiocarbon ages and SOC inventory at a eucalyptus plantation site in which tillage was stopped 20 years ago were similar to those of NF, indicating that a recovery process had occurred. The soil microbial biomass was generally lower at the plantation sites than at the NF site. Both the radiocarbon abundance and SOC inventories in the upper 30 cm soil layer showed positive correlations with the soil microbial biomass, suggesting that microbes may have played a key role in the fate of SOC. This study provided evidence that forest–plantation conversion may facilitate the dissimilation of SOC, and also demonstrated that radiocarbon can serve as a powerful tool for assessing the potential changes of soil carbon dynamics resulting from forest-to-plantation conversion. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Forest-to-plantation conversion; Microbial communities; Radiocarbon analysis; Soil organic carbon dynamics","Luo, C.; State Key Laboratory of Geochemistry, China; email: clluo@gig.ac.cn",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086066233

In South-East Asia, the widespread of oil palm has boomed over the last two decades, resulting in the downfall of tropical forest land. This change has been particularly prevalent in Borneo with protected lands increasingly developed for palm oil and already deforested lands are being converted into industrial plantations. The primary concerns relating to this pattern of land use change are the short and long-term impacts of logging on our natural environments and ecosystems and how patterns of deforestation are contributing to global environment issues such as climate change. By detecting and mapping logging activities, forestry departments are better able to predict land cover changes in a particular region as a result of development and deforestation. In this study, land cover assessment based on remote sensing techniques was used to analyse changes in the Bintulu district, Borneo especially oil palm growth and its influence on the decline of forest areas between 2016 and 2018. High resolution satellite imageries (3 m spatial resolution) from PlanetScope were used due to the benefits in helping to differentiate several land cover classes over a higher spatial resolution. Results showed that a decline of primary forests in Bintulu is about 26.5% over the past 2 years. With that decline, comes a rise of oil palm growth by 17.6% just within 2 years. An increased in logged areas (36.1%) for conversion to other land-covers with a steady decline of other land cover classes by at least 20% each year was detected. The accuracy of results proved a reasonable accuracy with 90.0% confidence with satellite imagery. Thus, with the result a necessary step can be considered to monitor and prevent deforestation and various encroachment in the forest. With high-resolution satellite data, monitoring at local scales has become possible to resource managers as a way to create timely and reliable assessments. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ismail, M.H.; Faculty of Forestry, Malaysia; email: mhasmadi@upm.edu.my",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092409125

Among the disturbances in tropical forests, the mid- and long-term impacts of fire are still poorly known, especially how fire interacts with selective logging. In this study, we approached the two following questions in relation to dense ombrophilous forests with a history of selective logging: How does fire impact forest recovery? What is the relationship between pre-fire forest conditions and post-fire dynamics? We used data for trees with DBH ≥ 5 cm from 36 permanent plots of 0.25-ha (50 m × 50 m) in an area of dense ombrophilous forest monitored over 31 years in the Tapajós National Forest, in Brazil's eastern Amazon. The area is under forest management that includes logging, the application of post-harvesting silvicultural treatments and an accidental fire. To determine the effects of pre-fire disturbances (logging and thinning) on basal area (G), mortality rate (MR) and recruitment rate (RR), a repeated measures ANOVA was applied. The post-fire forest recovery was also assessed by looking at changes in G, MR and RR. These variables were evaluated through a Linear Mixed Effect Model. In the post-fire period, there was a combined effect of logging commercial species, thinning non-commercial species (F = 9.255; p-value < 0.01) and time (F = 20.210; p-value < 0.01) in G, with no fire effect (F = 0.710; p-value = 0.406). Our study found the dense ombrophilous forest to be resilient enough to recover from logging, thinning, and a superficial fire, and that logging intensity is a determinant factor in forest dynamics. The forest in our control area with no history of previous strong and frequent disturbances was more resistant to fire in terms of lower mortality rates than the logged and thinned areas. In the short-term, the fire affected mainly the dynamics of smaller trees (DBH < 20 cm). In the med-term (15 years after the fire), we observed no fire effects on the reduction of basal area in any of the treatments and the forest maintained a continuous recovery of its lost stocks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Logging; Silvicultural treatments; Tree mortality; Tree recruitment; Tropical forests","de Andrade, D.F.C.; Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation, Av, Tapajós, 2201, Laguinho, Brazil; email: darlison.andrade@icmbio.gov.br",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085994037

However, the survival and subsequent growth of enrichment plantings depend on how they respond to competition from neighbours. For successful forest restoration or commercial forest management, the challenge is to determine appropriate frequencies and intensities of silvicultural interventions, principally competition reduction. In this study, we use long-term data (49–60 years) from four enrichment planting experiments established after selective logging and girdling of non-commercial trees in a tropical rainforest in north Queensland, Australia, to assess the effects of competition on the survival and growth of enrichment plantings. We found that residual overwood development severely reduced the survival, diameter and volume growth of two widely planted rainforest species - Flindersia brayleyana (Rutaceae) and Agathis robusta (Araucariaceae). Both species responded well to overstory removal, either as an initial treatment or thereafter. Use of Hegyi's competition index confirmed the strong suppressive effect of neighbours. The most abundant competitor was the fast-growing, early-secondary species Acacia aulacocarpa, which only became apparent after cessation of silvicultural treatments, 7 years after planting. Our results reaffirm the importance of an initial or early-age removal of the competing overstory for the success of enrichment planting. Further silvicultural treatments may be required for extended periods to control excessively increased overwood basal area and to remove late emerging pioneer or early secondary species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Acacia aulacocarpa; Agathis robusta; Flindersia brayleyana; Hegyi's index; Logged tropical rainforest; Overwood competition; Underplanting","Quang, P.M.; Tropical Forests and People Research Centre, Sippy Downs, Australia; email: quang.phan@research.usc.edu.au",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084861905

We investigated the demographic mechanisms of above-ground biomass recovery over 48 years in an Australian tropical forest following four silvicultural treatments: selective logging only as a control and selective logging followed by low-, medium- and high-intensity thinning. Initial biomass recovery rates following thinning were poor predictors of the long-term changes. Initial biomass recovery from 1969 to 1973 was slow and was largely concentrated on an increase in the biomass of residual stems. From 1973 to 1997, above ground biomass (AGB) increased almost linearly, with a similar slope for all sites. From 1997 to 2015, the rate of biomass accumulation slowed, especially for the L treatment. All thinning treatments stimulated more recruitment and regrowth of non-harvested remaining trees compared to the untreated control. Biomass at both the low and medium intensity treatments has almost fully recovered to 98% and 97% of pre-logging biomass levels respectively. The predicted times of complete above-ground biomass recovery for the logging only and high intensity treatments are 55 and 77 years respectively. The slower biomass recovery at the logging only site was largely due to increased mortality in the last measurement period. The slower recovery of the high intensity site was due to a combination of a higher initial reduction in biomass from thinning and the increased mortality in the last measurement period. The high mortality rates in the most recent measurement period are likely due to the impacts of two cyclones that impacted the study site. Our results suggest that it will take at least around 50 years for this site to recover to its pre-harvest biomass, much longer than many of the cutting cycles currently used in tropical forest management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Growth; Logging; Long-term forest plots; Mortality; Recovery; Recruitment; Thinning","Hu, J.; School of Agriculture and Food Sciences, Australia; email: jhu@usc.edu.au",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084800762

However continued loss and degradation of forested landscapes, coupled with a rapidly rising global population, is placing incredible pressure on forests globally. The United Nations has developed the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD +) programme in response to the challenges facing tropical forests and in recognition of the role they can play in climate mitigation. REDD + requires consistent and reliable monitoring of forests, however, national-level methodologies for measuring degradation are often bespoke and, because of an inability to track degradation effectively, the majority of countries combine reporting for deforestation and forest degradation into a single value. Here, we extend a recent analysis that enabled the detection of selective logging at the scale of a logging concession to a regional-scale estimation of selective logging activities. We utilized logging records from across Brazil to train a supervised classification algorithm for detecting logged pixels in Landsat imagery then predicted the extent of logging over a 20 year period throughout Rondônia, Brazil. Approximately one-quarter of the forested lands in Rondônia were cleared between 2000 and 2019. We estimate that 11.0% of the forest area present in 2000 had been selectively logged by 2019, comprising >11 500 km2 of forest. In general, rates of selective logging were twice as high in the first decade relative to the last decade of the period. Our approach is a considerable advance in developing an operationalized selective logging monitoring system capable of detecting subtle forest disturbances over large spatial scales. © 2020 The Author(s).

These results were consistent among 15 Angiosperm lineages, even though families differed widely in their leaf and root traits. Context: How plant organ morphologies vary with environment is key for inferring plant functional strategies. Aims: We were interested in quantifying any changes in fine root and leaf morphology of saplings with local-scale environmental variation in tropical forest, and if any variation in organ morphologies differed with plant lineage. Methods: We measured functional traits of fine root systems and leaves of saplings from 15 families in historically logged and unlogged Chinese tropical forest, where soil fertility and texture slightly decreased with greater forest age. Results: Root morphological traits were more conservative, while leaf morphologies were more acquisitive in primary forest than in secondary forest. From secondary to primary forests, mean root system diameter increased 0.4 mm, mean specific root length decreased 3.5 m kg−1, and mean root system branching intensity decreased by 0.3 tips cm−1. Similarly, from secondary to primary forests, average leaf area increased 7 cm2 and specific leaf area decreased 0.8 m2 kg−1. Leaf thickness and root tissue density were not different. Among the selected plant families, root and leaf morphological differences between forest types were consistent.

However, binary maps may fall short regarding the optimum representation of this type of disturbance, as tree harvest in tropical forests can be highly heterogeneous. Objectives: The objective of this study is to map forest disturbance intensities in areas of selective logging located in the Brazilian Amazon. Methods: Selective logging activities were mapped in ten forest management units using Sentinel-2 data at 10 m resolution. A spatial pattern analysis was applied to the logging map, using a moving window approach with different window sizes. Two landscape metrics were used to derive a forest disturbance intensity map. This map was then compared with actual disturbances using field data and a post-harvest forest recovery analysis. Results: Disturbed areas were grouped into five distinct disturbance intensity classes, from very low to very high. Classes high and very high were found to be related to log landings and large felling gaps, while very low intensities were mainly related to isolated disturbance types. The post-harvest forest recovery analysis showed that the five classes can be clearly distinguished from one another, with the clearest differences in the year of logging and one year after it. Conclusions: The approach described represents an important step towards a better mapping of selectively logged areas, when compared to the use of binary maps. The disturbance intensity classes could be used as indicators for forest monitoring as well as for further evaluation of areas under forest management. © 2020, The Author(s).","Composition; Configuration; Disturbance profiles; Multi-scale analysis; Selective logging","Lima, T.A.; Department of Forest Resources Management, 2424 Main Mall, Canada; email: tha.almeida.lima@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089194517

Recently, there has been increasing interest in understanding which traits make bird species resilient or vulnerable to such changes. Physiological stress mediated by the steroid hormone corticosterone (CORT) might underlie changes in local abundance of species because it regulates a range of body functions and behaviours to maintain homeostasis in changing environments. We conducted a 3-year study to assess (a) the variation in CORT levels in feathers (where CORT is deposited during the moult) of 10 understorey bird species across both unlogged old-growth forest and selectively logged forest in Borneo, (b) how this variation is associated with within-year variation in population abundance between forest types and (c) whether the difference in feather CORT (fCORT) between co-specific populations living in unlogged and logged forests in 1 year is related with their difference in population abundance the following year. We used effect size estimates to measure standardized magnitude and direction of fCORT changes between unlogged and selectively logged forest. We found small to large effect sizes, indicating large among-species variation in physiological acclimatization to changes in forest conditions. In 2016 and 2018, species with relatively higher fCORT in unlogged forest were relatively more abundant in logged forest in the same year; in 2017, species with relatively higher fCORT in logged forest were relatively more abundant in logged forest. Importantly, we found that for a given species, the difference in fCORT at year (x) between unlogged and logged forests was negatively related with a difference in its local abundance between the two forest types in the following year (x + 1). Our results point to glucocorticoid hormones as potential mediators of carry-over effects on population abundance due to direct and indirect effects of silvicultural practices in tropical forests of Borneo, suggesting fCORT as a potential marker of population changes.

We report a long-term comparison of ACD recovery rates between naturally regenerating and actively restored logged tropical forests. Restoration enhanced decadal ACD recovery by more than 50%, from 2.9 to 4.4 megagrams per hectare per year. This magnitude of response, coupled with modal values of restoration costs globally, would require higher carbon prices to justify investment in restoration.

The most accurate assessment involved ground data collection, including its data processing. In certain condition, it is extremely challenging, due to the difficulties of accessing dense forest and variation of terrain, tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, due to these limitations, remote sensing might become a better approach in measuring this information. The focus of this study is to estimate the tree stump height for biomass estimation after selective logging practices. In this study, we utilize remotely sensed canopy height model (CHM) derived from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to quantify tree stump height after felling logs at a local scale. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of utilizing UAV imagery to derive a canopy height model (CHM) for preparing parameters in assessing timber tree biomass. CHM is the reference surface to derive statistics that will be used to estimate the forest variables. Data was obtained through UAV which flown at the logging compartment in Ulu Jelai Forest Reserve, Pahang, Malaysia. The estimated stump height obtained from this technique was compared with a measured stump on the ground. Based on scatterplot regression, it showed a significant relationship with a strong coefficient, R2 of 0.8368.

After being felled, burned and farmed for a short time, the forest coverage of Xishuangbanna in China has been gradually reduced and replaced by a large area of secondary forests in different succession states. However, the changes of carbon stock and carbon balance in secondary forests succession have been rarely studied. In order to further reveal the tropical forest succession for the influence of carbon accumulation in Southwest China, and to formulate a more scientific management measures for tropical forest management, taking tropical forest with compllicated structure, biodiversity and huge biomass as the research object, and using the measured data of three tropical secondary forest samples, the change of carbon reserve, net carbon accumulation, dead carbon loss, carbon sequestration, and other carbon dynamics of tropical secondary forest in different succession states were discussed. The results indicated that: *1) In the process of forest succession, the distribution frequency of forest diameter at breast height (D B H) gradually develops from the near-normal distribution to the skewness distribution of footpath, that i s, with the progress of forest succession, the proportion of footpath trees became higher and higher. (2) The tropical secondary forests played an important role in carbon sequestration. (3) Small disturbances affected the carbon dynamics of the forest. Large disturbances, such as fire and logging, would lead to secondary succession of forests, with irreversible changes in the carbon dynamics of forests. (4) Drought events were the causes that affected the seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of litters, and were also an important factor affecting the carbon balance on a short time scale. (5) Large trees should be well studied for its significant important role in forest carbon balance. © 2020 Science Press.

However, studies addressing the effects of forest degradation on carbon, water, and energy cycles are scarce. Here, we integrate field observations and high-resolution remote sensing from airborne lidar to provide realistic initial conditions to the Ecosystem Demography Model (ED-2.2) and investigate how disturbances from forest degradation affect gross primary production (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and sensible heat flux (H). We used forest structural information retrieved from airborne lidar samples (13,500 ha) and calibrated with 817 inventory plots (0.25 ha) across precipitation and degradation gradients in the eastern Amazon as initial conditions to ED-2.2 model. Our results show that the magnitude and seasonality of fluxes were modulated by changes in forest structure caused by degradation. During the dry season and under typical conditions, severely degraded forests (biomass loss ≥66%) experienced water stress with declines in ET (up to 34%) and GPP (up to 35%) and increases of H (up to 43%) and daily mean ground temperatures (up to 6.5°C) relative to intact forests. In contrast, the relative impact of forest degradation on energy, water, and carbon cycles markedly diminishes under extreme, multiyear droughts, as a consequence of severe stress experienced by intact forests. Our results highlight that the water and energy cycles in the Amazon are driven by not only climate and deforestation but also the past disturbance and changes of forest structure from degradation, suggesting a much broader influence of human land use activities on the tropical ecosystems. ©2020.

Accurate and precise detection of selectively logged sites in a forest is crucial for analyzing the spatial distribution of forest disturbances and degradation. Remote sensing can be used to monitor selective logging activities and associated forest fires over tropical forests, which otherwise requires labor-intensive and time-consuming field surveys, that are costly and difficult to undertake. The number of studies on remote sensing for selective logging has grown steadily over the years, thus, the need for their review so as to guide forest management practices and current research. A variety of peer reviewed articles are discussed so as to evaluate the applicability and accuracy of different methods in different circumstances.

This calls for a better understanding of the different forest cover states and cost-efficient techniques to quantify the impact of degradation on forest structure. Canopy texture analyses based on Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) optical imagery provide proxies to assess forest structures but the mechanisms linking them with degradation have rarely been investigated. To address this gap, we used a lightweight Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to map 739 ha of degraded forests and acquire both canopy VHSR images and height model. Thirty-three years of degradation history from Landsat archives allowed us to sample 40 plots in undisturbed, logged, over-logged and burned and regrowth forests in tropical forested landscapes (Paragominas, Pará, Brazil). Fourier (FOTO) and lacunarity textures were used to assess forest canopy structure and to build a typology linking degradation history and current states. Texture metrics capture canopy grain, heterogeneity and openness gradients and correlate with forest structure variability (R2 = 0.58). Similar structures share common degradation history and can be discriminated on the basis of canopy texture alone (accuracy = 55%). Over-logging causes a lowering in forest height, which brings homogeneous textures and of finer grain. We identified the major changes in structures due to fire following logging which changes heterogeneous and intermediate grain into coarse textures. Our findings highlight the potential of canopy texture metrics to characterize degraded forests and thus be used as indicators for forest management and degradation mitigation. Inexpensive and agile UAV open promising perspectives at the interface between field inventory and satellite characterization of forest structure using texture metrics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Canopy structure; Forest degradation; Remote sensing; Texture; Tropical forest; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Bourgoin, C.; Clément Bourgoin, Campus International de Baillarguet, TA C-105/D, France; email: bourgoin.clement2@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082822234

However, the extent to which these changes in biodiversity drive modifications of ecosystem process rates such as leaf litter decomposition is poorly understood. To determine the relative effects of changes to the chemical quality of litter and shifts in microbial decomposers on leaf litter decomposition rates, we performed a controlled, reciprocal transplant, litter decomposition experiment across a tropical land-use disturbance gradient. Litter mixtures and soils were collected from old growth forest, moderately logged forest, heavily logged forest, and oil palm plantation in Sabah, Malaysia, and combined in a fully crossed, factorial microcosm experiment maintained under controlled environmental conditions. We found that whilst litter quality was the most important predictor of litter mass loss, soil origin was also significant, explaining between 5.17 and 15.43% of total variation. Microbial decomposer communities from old growth forest had greater functional breadth relative to those from logged forests and oil palm plantation as all litter types decomposed faster when combined with old growth soil. The most chemically recalcitrant litter (lowest N, highest lignin, lignin:N, and C:N ratio) from moderate logged forest decomposed faster when combined with its “home” soil (Home-Field Advantage) whilst the most labile litter from oil palm decomposed slowest when combined with its “home” soil. This was correlated with lower total soil microbial biomass. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that whilst litter quality regulated rates of litter decomposition across the disturbance gradient, soil microbial decomposer communities were functionally dissimilar between land uses and explained a significant proportion of variation. The impact of disturbance on soil, including microbial community structure, should be considered alongside changes to plant communities when assessing effects on crucial ecosystem processes such as decomposition. © Copyright © 2020 Elias, Robinson, Both, Goodall, Majalap-Lee, Ostle and McNamara.","functional dissimilarity; leaf litter decomposition; logging; oil palm; soil microbial communities; tropical forests","Elias, D.M.O.; UK Centre for Ecology Hydrology, United Kingdom; email: dafias@ceh.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096367184

The predictive performance of three ML techniques, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN), was compared against result from the GLM technique, across 85 sample plots. Interestingly, the GLM retrieved the most accurate estimations of forest AGB (rho Spearman's coefficient = 0.87), compared with the ML techniques (RF = 0.77, SVM = 0.67, and ANN = 0.50).

Degradation of natural forests leads to loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, impacting the livelihoods of surrounding communities. Efforts to address ongoing loss of natural forests, through mechanisms such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+), require an understanding of the links between forest degradation and the livelihoods of local communities, which have rarely been studied in Vietnam. We combined information from livelihood surveys, remote sensing and forest inventories around a protected natural forest area in North Central Vietnam. For forest-adjacent communities, we found natural forests contributed an average of 28% of total household income with plantation forests contributing an additional 15%. Although officially prohibited, logging contributed more than half of the total income derived from natural forests. Analysis of Landsat images over the period 1990 to 2014 combined with forest inventory data, demonstrates selective logging was leading to ongoing degradation of natural forests resulting in loss of 3.3 ± 0.8 Mg biomass ha-1 yr-1 across the protected area. This is equivalent to 1.5% yr-1 of total forest biomass, with rates as high as 3% yr-1 in degraded and easily accessible parts of the protected area. We estimate that preventing illegal logging would incur local opportunity costs of USD $4.10 ± 0.90 per Mg CO2, similar to previous estimates for tropical forest protected areas and substantially less than the opportunity costs in timber or agricultural concessions. Our analysis suggests activities to reduce forest degradation in protected areas are likely to be financially viable through Vietnam's REDD+ program. © 2020 The Author(s).

In Southeast Asia, 35% of peatlands had been drained and converted to plantations by 2010, and much of the remaining forest had been logged, contributing significantly to global carbon emissions. Yet, tropical forests have the capacity to regain biomass quickly and forests on drained peatlands may grow faster in response to soil aeration, so the net effect of humans on forest biomass remains poorly understood. In this study, two lidar surveys (made in 2011 and 2014) are compared to map forest biomass dynamics across 96 km2 of PSF in Kalimantan, Indonesia. The peatland is now legally protected for conservation, but large expanses were logged under concessions until 1998 and illegal logging continues in accessible portions. It was hypothesized that historically logged areas would be recovering biomass while recently logged areas would be losing biomass. We found that historically logged forests were recovering biomass near old canals and railways used by the concessions. Lidar detected substantial illegal logging activity—579 km of logging canals were located beneath the canopy. Some patches close to these canals have been logged in the 2011–2104 period (i.e. substantial biomass loss) but, on aggregate, these illegally logged regions were also recovering. Unexpectedly, rapid growth was also observed in intact forest that had not been logged and was over a kilometre from the nearest known canal, perhaps in response to greater aeration of surface peat. Comparing these results with flux measurements taken at other nearby sites, we find that carbon sequestration in above-ground biomass may have offset roughly half the carbon efflux from peat oxidation. This study demonstrates the power of repeat lidar survey to map fine-scale forest dynamics in remote areas, revealing previously unrecognized impacts of anthropogenic global change. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","above-ground biomass; airborne laser scanning; biomass; carbon; forest dynamics; hydrology; illegal logging; peat swamp forest","Coomes, D.; Department of Plant Sciences, United Kingdom; email: dac18@cam.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085142935

Many studies have examined post-disturbance changes in animal traits related to mutualistic interactions with plants, but the effect of disturbance on plant traits in diverse forests has received much less attention. Focusing on two study regions in the eastern Brazilian Amazon, we used a trait-based approach to examine how seed dispersal functionality within tropical plant communities changes across a landscape-scale gradient of human modification, including both regenerating secondary forests and primary forests disturbed by burning and selective logging. Surveys of 230 forest plots recorded 26,533 live stems from 846 tree species. Using herbarium material and literature, we compiled trait information for each tree species, focusing on dispersal mode and seed size. Disturbance reduced tree diversity and increased the proportion of lower wood density and small-seeded tree species in study plots. Disturbance also increased the proportion of stems with seeds that are ingested by animals and reduced those dispersed by other mechanisms (e.g. wind). Older secondary forests had functionally similar plant communities to the most heavily disturbed primary forests. Mean seed size and wood density per plot were positively correlated for plant species with seeds ingested by animals. Synthesis. Anthropogenic disturbance has major effects on the seed traits of tree communities, with implications for mutualistic interactions with animals. The important role of animal-mediated seed dispersal in disturbed and recovering forests highlights the need to avoid defaunation or promote faunal recovery. The changes in mean seed width suggest larger vertebrates hold especially important functional roles in these human-modified forests. Monitoring fruit and seed traits can provide a valuable indicator of ecosystem condition, emphasizing the importance of developing a comprehensive plant traits database for the Amazon and other biomes. © 2020 British Ecological Society","forest degradation; forest fires; forest regeneration; frugivory; functional traits; secondary forest; seed size; selective logging","Hawes, J.E.; Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Natural Resource Management, Norway; email: joseph.hawes@nmbu.no",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079729243

Selective logging and forest conversion to oil palm plantation has major implications for biogeochemical cycling and carbon storage that are underpinned by plant-soil interactions. Soil fungi are key regulators of carbon and mineral nutrient flows between above- and below-ground organisms, yet understanding of fungal community-productivity relationships in hyper-diverse tropical forests is lacking. Recent studies suggest sensitivity of soil fungal communities to land-use change, although impacts on fungal productivity remain largely unresolved. To address this gap, we installed hyphal in-growth bags for 6 months in old-growth (OG) and selectively logged (SL) forest and oil palm plantation (OP) in Bornean lowland rainforest. Mycelial (actively foraging) fungal communities were characterized by ITS amplicon sequencing, and mycelial production estimated by measurement of fungal hyphae. Mycelial fungal community compositions were similar in OG and SL forest, whereas OP had significantly different communities of saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, and pathogenic fungi. In particular, total mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungal relative abundances, total mycorrhizal richness and mycelial production was reduced. However, due to restricted sampling replication in OP, effects associated with site could not be excluded. In forest plots (OG & SL), we further explored the broader drivers of mycelial fungal communities using tree community, structure and productivity data, and soil and environmental properties. Forest mycelial community dissimilarities were related to soil and vegetation characteristics, while mycelial production was broadly independent of these as well as fungal community attributes. An increase in arbuscular mycorrhizal relative abundance was also found with selective logging, which may have implications for carbon storage capacity in these forests, while an apparent retention of mycorrhizal mycelium in SL forest may act as a reservoir of inoculum that could aid forest restoration. Our results show that conversion of rainforest to oil palm plantation has significant consequences for fungal diversity-productivity relationships with implications for nutrient and carbon dynamics and restoration over large spatial scales. © Copyright © 2020 Robinson, Elias, Johnson, Both, Riutta, Goodall, Majalap, McNamara, Griffiths and Ostle.","arbuscular; ectomycorrhizal; hyphae; inorganic P; ITS; mycorrhiza; oil palm; selective logging","Robinson, S.J.B.; Lancaster Environment Centre, United Kingdom; email: sjbrobinson@hotmail.co.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100831667

In the Brazilian Amazon, most logging operations are illegal and highly damaging to forests. However, the effects of illegal logging on wildlife are poorly studied. Here we investigate the effects of illegal logging on the assemblage of medium- to large-bodied terrestrial vertebrates at the Gurupi Biological Reserve, a protected area in extreme eastern Amazonia that has been subjected to three decades of illegal logging. We used camera traps to survey the terrestrial vertebrate assemblage and visual interpretation of Landsat time series data (1984–2016) to assess the history of illegal logging (number of logging bouts and recovery time) for each camera trap site. Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) indicates that logging had a minor effect on both the assemblage composition and individual species abundance. At the local level, the study demonstrates that the reserve effectively safeguards a significant portion of the regional biodiversity even though it suffered degradation by illegal logging. At a wider scale, the results suggest that illegally logged forests can retain much of their conservation value, if they are protected from further anthropogenic impacts such as hunting, fragmentation and fires. However, our study represents a best-case scenario, unlikely to be met in most other illegally logged areas in the tropics, where logging is usually followed by secondary effects that amplify its impacts. © 2020","Amazonia; Forest vertebrates; Gurupi Biological Reserve; Tropical forests","Carvalho, E.A.R.; Centro Nacional de Pesquisa e Conservação de Mamíferos Carnívoros, Estrada Municipal Hisaichi Takebayashi 8600, Brazil; email: elildojr@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082708682

Nevertheless, deforestation and forest degradation are rampant in many parts of the world. In particular, the Amazonian rainforest faces the constant threats posed by logging, mining, and burning for agricultural expansion. In Brazil, the ""Sete de Setembro Indigenous Land"", a protected area located in a lowland tropical forest region at the border between the Mato Grosso and Rondonia states, is subject to illegal deforestation and therefore necessitates effective vegetation monitoring tools. Optical satellite imagery, while extensively used for landcover assessment and monitoring, is vulnerable to high cloud cover percentages, as these can preclude analysis and strongly limit the temporal resolution. We propose a cloud computing-based coupled detection strategy using (i) cloud and cloud shadow/vegetation detection systems with Sentinel-2 data analyzed on the Google Earth Engine with deep neural network classification models, with (ii) a classification error correction and vegetation loss and gain analysis tool that dynamically compares and updates the classification in a time series. The initial results demonstrate that such a detection system can constitute a powerful monitoring tool to assist in the prevention, early warning, and assessment of deforestation and forest degradation in cloudy tropical regions. Owing to the integrated cloud detection system, the temporal resolution is significantly improved. The limitations of the model in its present state include classification issues during the forest fire period, and a lack of distinction between natural vegetation loss and anthropogenic deforestation. Two possible solutions to the latter problem are proposed, namely, the mapping of known agricultural and bare areas and its subsequent removal from the analyzed data, or the inclusion of radar data, which would allow a large amount of finetuning of the detection processes. © 2020 by the authors.","Analysis-ready data; Cloud cover; Cloud shadow; Deep learning; Deforestation; Google earth engine; Landcover; Rainforest; Sentinel-2; Vegetation","Giuliani, G.; Institute for Environmental Sciences, Switzerland; email: gregory.giuliani@unige.ch",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086442347

However, while the direct impact of anthropogenic disturbance on animal communities has been well studied, the consequences of such defaunation for mutualistic interactions such as seed dispersal remains chiefly understood at the plant species level. We asked whether communities of endozoochorous tree species had altered seed removal in forests affected by hunting and logging and if this could be related to modifications of the frugivore community. At two contrasting forest sites in French Guiana, Nouragues (protected) and Montagne de Kaw (hunted and partly logged), we focused on four families of animal-dispersed trees (Sapotaceae, Myristicaceae, Burseraceae, and Fabaceae), which represent 88% of all endozoochorous trees that were fruiting at the time and location of the study. We assessed the abundance of the seed dispersers and predators of these four focal families by conducting diurnal distance sampling along line transects. Densities of several key seed dispersers such as large-bodied primates were greatly reduced at Montagne de Kaw, where the specialist frugivore Ateles paniscus is probably extinct. In parallel, we estimated seed removal rates from fruit and seed counts conducted in 1-m2 quadrats placed on the ground beneath fruiting trees. Seed removal rates dropped from 77% at Nouragues to 47 % at Montagne de Kaw, confirming that the loss of frugivores associated with human disturbance impacts seed removal at the community level. In contrast to Sapotaceae, whose seeds are dispersed by mammals only, weaker declines in seed removal for Burseraceae and Myristicaceae suggest that some compensation may occur for these bird- and mammal-dispersed families, possibly because of the high abundance of Toucans at the disturbed site. The defaunation process currently occurring across many tropical forests could dramatically reduce the diversity of entire communities of animal-dispersed trees through seed removal limitation. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America","French Guiana; frugivory; hunting; logging; seed dispersal; seed removal; tropical rain forest","Boissier, O.; UMR 7179 MNHN – CNRS, 1, avenue du Petit Château, France; email: olivier.boissier7@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084133960

To contribute to this discussion, we estimated the carbon balance from logging natural tropical forests in Costa Rica through a life cycle accounting approach. Our system included all major life cycle processes at a regional level during one rotation period (15 years). We used mass flow analysis to trace biogenic carbon. Data were gathered from all logging operations in the Costa Rican NW region (107 management plants), a sample of industries transforming wood into final products (20 sawmills), and national reports. We estimated a surplus of −3.06 Mg C ha−1 15 year−1 stored within the system. When accounting for uncertainty and variability in a Monte Carlo analysis, the average balance shifted to −2.19 Mg C ha−1 15 year−1 with a 95% CI of −5.26 to 1.86. This confidence interval reveals probabilities of a net increase in atmospheric carbon due to harvesting although these are smaller than those from a system that acts as a reservoir. Our results provide evidence for the carbon neutrality of bio-materials obtained from natural forests. We found that anthropogenic reservoirs play a determinant role in delaying carbon emissions and that these may explain differences with previous carbon balance studies on tropical forest management. Therefore, the climate mitigation potential of forest-derived products is not exclusive to forest management, but measures should be considered throughout the processes of wood transformation, use, and disposal. © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) for monitoring AGB stocks and change (ΔAGB) in a selectively logged tropical forest in eastern Amazonia. Specifically, we compare results from a suite of different modelling methods with extensive field data. The calibration AGB values were derived from 85 square field plots sized 50 ± 50 m field plots established in 2014 and which were estimated using airborne LiDAR data acquired in 2012, 2014, and 2017. LiDAR-derived metrics were selected based upon Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and used to estimate AGB stock and change. The statistical approaches were: ordinary least squares regression (OLS), and nine machine learning approaches: random forest (RF), several variations of k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to compare performance based upon root mean square error (RMSE) and mean difference (MD). The results show that OLS had the best performance with an RMSE of 46.94 Mg/ha (19.7%) and R2 = 0.70. RF, SVM, and ANN were adequate, and all approaches showed RMSE ≤54.48 Mg/ha (22.89%). Models derived from k-NN variations all showed RMSE ≥64.61 Mg/ha (27.09%). The OLS model was thus selected to map AGB across the time-series. The mean (±sd-standard deviation) predicted AGB stock at the landscape level was 229.10 (±232.13) Mg/ha in 2012, 258.18 (±106.53) in 2014, and 240.34 (sd ± 177.00) Mg/ha in 2017, showing the effect of forest growth in the first period and logging in the second period. In most cases, unlogged areas showed higher AGB stocks than logged areas. Our methods showed an increase in AGB in unlogged areas and detected small changes from reduced-impact logging (RIL) activities occurring after 2012. We also detected that the AGB increase in areas logged before 2012 was higher than in unlogged areas. Based on our findings, we expect our study could serve as a basis for programs such as REDD+ and assist in detecting and understanding AGB changes caused by selective logging activities in tropical forests. © 2020 by the authors.","Amazon; Forest structure; Mapping; Modelling; Remote sensing","Rex, F.E.; Department of Forest Engineering, Brazil; email: francielrexx@ufpr.br",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085982741

Here, we confront three hypotheses to explain this dominance: (a) these species have expanded their distribution because of widespread past slash-and-burn activities, as suggested by important charcoal amounts recorded in the soils of the region; (b) their abundance is rather explained by soil properties, as this guild establishes preferentially on favourable physico-chemical conditions for rapid growth; (c) soil properties have been substantially influenced by past human disturbances and those two effects cannot be disentangled. Location: Pallisco-CIFM logging concession, southeastern Cameroon (300,000 ha). Methods: We quantified soil charcoal abundance and measured ten soil variables at the basis of 60 target trees that belonged to a list of three long-living pioneer light-demanding (LLP) and four shade-bearer (SB) species. We identified all stems with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 20 cm within a distance of 15 m around each target tree. Species were characterised by their wood-specific gravity (WSG), which reflected their light requirement. Multiple regression models were used to quantify and test the relative effects of charcoal abundance and soil variables on the mean WSG of the 60 tree communities, as well as the abundance of three guilds: LLP, SB, and non-pioneer light demanders (NPLD). Results: The mean WSG was the only response variable significantly explained by soil variables and charcoal abundance combined. It was significantly negatively associated with soil calcium and Mg content and with charcoal abundance, with soil and charcoal influencing the mean WSG independently. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence that past human disturbances and soil fertility have independently promoted the establishment of light-demanding species in western Central African forests, thereby shedding light on tree community assembly rules in these ecosystems which remain considerably understudied compared to the tropical forests of other continents. © 2020 International Association for Vegetation Science","light-demanding species; moist tropical forests; past human disturbances; shade-bearer species; soil charcoal abundance; soil properties; tree community assemblages; wood-specific gravity","Vleminckx, J.; CNRS, France; email: jasvlx86@gmail.com

Our study aimed to assess the structure and tree species diversity of mixed dipterocarp forest remnants from the Planted Forest Zone (PFZ) located in the Bintulu Division, Sarawak, compared with a forest considered relatively undisturbed (i.e. that has experienced no recent logging activities). We also compared three plot methods (50 × 50 m, 20 × 50 m and 10 × 50 m plots) in order to evaluate which could be used for time- and cost-effective inventories of structure and tree species diversity in fragmented forests. No significant differences were found between the fragmented forests and the relatively undisturbed forest for stem density, species richness and diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson). Dissimilarities in species, genus and family composition were observed between fragmented and relatively undisturbed forest, as well as between forest remnants themselves. These dissimilarities were likely to be related to intrinsic variation in these highly diverse tropical forests. However, an unusually high abundance of pioneer species (i.e. Macaranga) was found in plots from forest remnants. The forest remnants also had significantly lower basal areas due to a lack of trees in large diameter classes, which is likely a result of impacts from past logging activities. Otherwise, our results highlight the current high conservation value of the forest remnants—although the studied communities are likely to experience time-delayed shifts in species composition and/or extinctions in the future, with the effect of fragmentation on biodiversity being currently underestimated. Finally, for further studies of fragmented forests we recommend the use of 10 × 50 m plots which are faster and easier to implement in the field while providing estimates of structure and tree species diversity that are consistent with those from larger plots. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Forest fragmentation; Forest inventory methods; Planted Forest Zone of Bintulu; Species richness","Ganivet, E.; Department of Land Management and Systems, New Zealand; email: ganivet.elias@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078142859

To quantify the change in the vegetation cover, a detection technique using Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) images was applied. Most parts of the main study area on Peleng are covered by highly degraded forest. However, the degradation decreases with increasing altitude. The EVI application shows that 48 % of Peleng's forests are highly degraded, 28 % are moderately degraded, and 24 % are less degradation. Highly degraded and poorly managed forests occur at a lower altitude, where the road infrastructure (thus the accessibility) is developed well. Moderately degraded forest is found at borders with cultivation areas. The less degraded areas are found at a higher altitude, far from human habitations, which are mainly in the coastal areas. Local agriculture activities, illegal logging, and wildlife hunting are the main causes of forest degradation. This work represents one of few studies that apply the EVI in tropical forests.

Amazon forests without SFMPs are susceptible to deforestation because such plans integrate the use of forest products and conservation goals by allowing selective wood extraction following regulations aimed at reducing the long-term impact of logging. However, it remains uncertain whether reduced-impact selective logging typical of SFMPs (17–20 m3 ha− 1 yr− 1 of 38–70 species) changes forest regeneration, carbon (C) stocks, and nutrient cycling. Here, we tested the hypothesis that litter and soil biogeochemical parameters serve as indicators of sustainable logging as forest regeneration, C stocks, and C-to-nutrient ratios in soil and litter become progressively similar to those of primary forests as time elapses after logging. We used a chronosequence spanning nine years since logging to relate litter and soil (at 0–10, 10–30, 30–50 cm depth) C stocks and 12 and 15 biogeochemical parameters, respectively, as well as canopy cover and tree seedling density (10–150 cm tall) in upland evergreen Amazon forests. In one unlogged and four logged stands sampled three, five, seven, and nine years after logging, we compared 15 permanent plots (three replicated 0.5 ha plots per time-since-logging category). We found that five parameters explained &gt;80% of the variation in soil and litter properties among logged and unlogged stands. Litter parameters were more sensitive to logging than soil parameters, as litter C stocks and C-to-nutrient ratios increased systematically after logging. Canopy cover decreased over time and was ~14% lower nine years after logging. Total seedling density did not change consistently over time but was ~54% higher seven years after logging. Our data suggest that the SFMP guidelines have served the purpose of maintaining soil quality and forest regeneration.

This research sought to investigate the correlation of edaphic factors with the spatial distribution patterns of the 16 main tree species in a dense ombrophilous forest of terra firme in Macapá, Amapá, Brazil. Forty subplots along a topographic gradient were installed for floristic studies as well as to collect composite soil samples. The spatial distribution pattern was described by the Payandeh and Morisita indexes. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and geostatistical techniques were used to describe the relationship between species distribution and environmental variables. It was confirmed that the factors influencing the spatial behaviour of plants in the vegetation can be associated with both the endogenous (dispersion mode) and exogenous (the environmental conditions to which they are subjected) processes. Variations in spatial distribution patterns of species in relation to existing environmental heterogeneity were observed based on the CCA, mainly associated with the contents of pH, potential acidity, organic matter (OM), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in soil. Finally, based on ordinary kriging there was evidence that the OM contents in the soil presented a spatial dependence structure in the vegetation. Our findings show that natural disturbances (e.g. natural fall of trees) and human land use (e.g. logging) induce changes in species composition and abiotic resource availability.

However, little is known about the long-term survival and growth of these trees. In this study, we used historical data from enrichment planting trials ranging from 15 to 32 years old to examine the survival and growth of 16 tree species across different sites in north Queensland, Australia. The results complement and extend current knowledge on the potential role of enrichment planting from a production perspective. A key finding was that the initial level of post-logging overwood did not appear to affect the immediate survival of enrichment plantings, but in the longer term (up to 30 years) survival decreased as post-logging overwood and regrowth increased. This suggests that removal of overwood should take place at the time of enrichment planting. A further key finding was that despite regular tending to remove vegetation adjacent to the plantings, competition from saplings and trees that were situated outside the tended area emerged as a major source of competition in some plots. By implication, the success of enrichment planting may depend on removal of competition from the entire logged area, not just adjacent to enrichment plantings. Results between individual species and trials varied widely. The best development of Flindersia brayleyana resulted in a mean tree diameter of 32.5 cm at age 22 for the 100 tallest trees per hectare. Although Eucalyptus grandis, Eucalyptus microcorys, and Eucalyptus pilularis all failed-as expected, because they do not normally grow in rainforest-Corymbia torelliana, Cardwellia sublimis, Araucaria bidwillii, Khaya senegalensis, Flindersia amboinensis, and Swietenia macrophylla also failed although they grow naturally in similar sites. In other trials, tree height and basal area growth were often poor. For example, Khaya ivorensis grew to a basal area of only 1.3 m2/ha and a mean height of 7.7 m at age 10, and Flindersia iaiana only grew to a basal area of 0.7 m2/ha and a height of 7.9 m, also at age 10. Overall, these results emphasise the necessity of site-species matching before enrichment planting begins and the necessity of post-planting monitoring and remedial tending. © 2020 by the authors.","Assisted natural regeneration; Enrichment planting; Flindersia brayleyana; Forest restoration; Silviculture; Tropical rainforest; Underplanting","Quang, P.M.; Tropical Forests and People Research Centre, Australia; email: quang.phan@research.usc.edu.au",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086759165

Rubber plantation mapping provides basic information for surveying resources, updating forest subplot information, logging, and managing the forest. However, due to the diversity of stand structure, complexity of the forest growth environment, and the similarity of spectral characteristics between rubber trees and natural forests, it is difficult to discriminate rubber plantation from natural forest using only spectral information. This study evaluated the validity of textural features for rubber plantation recognition at different spatial resolutions using GaoFen-1 (GF-1), Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 optical data. C-band Sentinel-1 10 m imagery was first used to map forests (including both rubber plantations and natural forests) and non-forests, then the pixels identified as forests in the Sentinel-1 imagery were compared with GF-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 images to separate rubber plantations and natural forest using two different approaches: a method based on spectral information characteristics only and a method combining spectral and textural features. In addition, we extracted textural features of different window sizes (3 x 3 to 31 x 31) and analyzed the influence of window size on the separability of rubber plantations and natural forests. Our major findings include: (1) the suitable texture extraction window sizes of GF-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 are 31 x 31, 11 x 11 to 15 x 15, and 3 x 3 to 7 x 7, respectively; (2) correlation (COR) is a robust textural feature in remote sensing images with different resolutions; and (3) compared with classification by spectral information only, the producer's accuracy of rubber plantations based on GF-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 was improved by 8.04%, 9.44%, and 8.74%, respectively, and the user's accuracy was increased by 4.63%, 4.54%, and 6.75%, respectively, when the textural features were introduced.

To this end, we measured mammal diversity in terms of community structure (i.e. abundance, composition and species richness) and functional diversity in three sites differing in conservation effort in a tropical rainforest in Cameroon. Results show that sites without primary or secondary conservation efforts had lower mammal abundances and an altered mammal composition but similar species richness compared to better-protected areas. In terms of functional diversity, we found more variation of traits (i.e. FDis) in the site with primary conservation and higher abundances of functionally unique species (i.e. FOri) in sites with either primary or secondary conservation efforts. We found no overall difference in the abundance of specialist and generalist species between sites (i.e. FSpe).

The aim of the study was to assess the temporal effect of cutting intensity on Diptera community in tropical rainforest in the eastern Borneo rainforest, Indonesia, which was logged using the Indonesian Selective Cutting and Planting system. The field study was carried out in 2016. Responses of Diptera to the Indonesian Selective Cutting and Planting systems in the eastern Borneo rainforest, Indonesia were examined. We compared the abundance and morphospecies composition of Diptera before cutting and after cutting at three different treatments: low cutting intensity, medium cutting intensity and high cutting intensity. Diptera was collected using a malaise trap. Selective cutting of tropical rainforest altered biodiversity of Diptera. The abundance and morphospecies composition of Diptera were greater after cutting than before cutting at all cutting intensities. Our study showed that cutting intensity did not significantly affect the abundance and morphospecies composition of Diptera.

Despite the structural damage incurred, selectively logged forests typically retain more biodiversity than other forest disturbances. Most logging impact studies consider conventional metrics, like species richness, but these can conceal subtle biodiversity impacts. The mass–abundance relationship is an integral feature of ecological communities, describing the negative relationship between body mass and population abundance, where, in a system without anthropogenic influence, larger species are less abundant due to higher energy requirements. Changes in this relationship can indicate community structure and function changes. We investigated the impacts of selective logging on the mass–abundance scaling of avian communities by conducting a meta-analysis to examine its pantropical trend. We divide our analysis between studies using mist netting, sampling the understory avian community, and point counts, sampling the entire community. Across 19 mist-netting studies, we found no consistent effects of selective logging on mass–abundance scaling relative to primary forests, except for the omnivore guild where there were fewer larger-bodied species after logging. In eleven point-count studies, we found a more negative relationship in the whole community after logging, likely driven by the frugivore guild, showing a similar pattern. Limited effects of logging on mass–abundance scaling may suggest high species turnover in logged communities, with like-for-like replacement of lost species with similar-sized species. The increased negative mass–abundance relationship found in some logged communities could result from resource depletion, density compensation, or increased hunting; potentially indicating downstream impacts on ecosystem functions.

Our results suggest that size distributions of avian communities in logged forests are relatively robust to disturbance, potentially maintaining ecosystem processes in these forests, thus underscoring the high conservation value of logged tropical forests, indicating an urgent need to focus on their protection from further degradation and deforestation. © 2020 The Authors.

Currently, there are large gaps in understanding how fire affects understory forest structure and composition, interactions with fire recurrence, and long-term impacts. Understanding these changes is critical to evaluate the present and future response of tropical forests to fire. We studied post-fire changes in understory regeneration in forests in Mato Grosso State, southern Amazonia, Brazil, aiming to answer the following questions: (i) does forest structure (basal area) and tree community composition vary with fire frequency and time since the last fire? (ii) does the response differ among strata (e.g., sapling, larger trees)? (iii) are changes in diversity associated with changes in forest structure? We surveyed trees and lianas in previously structurally intact forests that underwent selective logging, followed by different fire histories, including 5 and 16 years after once-burned, 5 years after three times burned, and unburned (control). Overall, species composition (abundance, richness, and number of families) and diversity were highest for the unburned treatment and lowest for the recurrent burned areas. Fire frequency negatively affected plant structure and basal area; basal area of small, medium, and large plants declined significantly by more than 50% in the most frequently burned areas. Richness was positively related to basal area in the three times burned sites and in the 16 years regenerating site for all strata. Our results demonstrate the negative influence of frequent fires on both the composition and structure of small trees in Amazonian forest. These changes to the cohort of small-sized trees may persist and have long-term impacts on forest structure, affecting the capacity, and direction of forest recovery. With wildfire widespread across the region and increasing in frequency, fire may negatively affect tree diversity in remaining selectively logged forests, and affect regional carbon cycling with consequences for the global vegetation carbon sink. © Copyright © 2020 Prestes, Massi, Silva, Nogueira, de Oliveira, Freitag, Marimon, Marimon-Junior, Keller and Feldpausch.","basal area; carbon; diversity; regeneration; resilience; richness; seedling; selective logging","Feldpausch, T.R.; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ecologia e Conservação, Brazil; email: t.r.feldpausch@exeter.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092144628

In Brazil, the restoration goal for 2030 is 12 million hectares. Despite the great demand for ecological restoration across the whole of Brazil, there have been no analyses of the studies carried out in different biomes. In addition, conservation efforts must cover all biomes, so that different regions can take advantage of the many benefits of restoration. Our aim was to identify advances and gaps in current restoration knowledge in order to guide future efforts in Brazil. Our bibliometric survey in the Web of Science using 23 keywords related to restoration generated a total of 530 papers, of which 291 were included in the analysis. The papers were published in 121 scientific journals between 1988 and 2018, with the largest number of papers in 2016. The Atlantic Forest was the biome with the highest number of studies, as it is one of the most threatened tropical forest regions in the world and maintains the largest number of research institutions and receives the highest level of funding support in the country. Regarding the types of studies, temporal monitoring was more frequent in the Amazon, Cerrado, Caatinga, and Pampa, while the monitoring at one point in time was more frequent in the Atlantic Forest. From the studies examined, 31% used a reference area for comparing restoration success. The most studied organisms were plants (81%), and among them, trees were the most frequent, followed by fungi, birds, invertebrates, mammals, and reptiles. The pre-restoration degradation differed among biomes, with deforestation for logging the most cited in the Amazon, agriculture, and livestock in the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, logging and cattle ranching in Caatinga, and livestock in the Pampa and Pantanal. In general, active/assisted natural succession was the most frequent restoration process: planting seedlings more readily occurred in the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and Caatinga, whereas natural regeneration in the Cerrado and Pantanal and sowing in Pampa. The studies varied among the age of restoration (>1 to 67 years for active restoration and >1 to 120 years for passive/unassisted natural succession), and the number of species planted (1 to 121 species). We identified an important regional knowledge gap for the Pantanal, Caatinga, and Pampa, as well as the need to include reference areas, evaluate different restoration techniques (besides planting seedlings), and the inclusion of other taxa and life forms in biodiversity studies apart from trees. We also identified the need to expand research to assess landscape metrics, prioritization, legislation, and public policies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bibliometrics; Fauna restoration; Restoration ecology; Restoration history; Scientific publications","Guerra, A.; Laboratório de Ecologia da Intervenção – LEI, Avenida Costa e Silva, s/n°, Bairro Universitário, Brazil; email: angelicaguerraufms@gmail.com",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076865097

However, its stocks have dramatically declined due, inter alia, to excessive logging, insufficient natural regeneration and a slow recovery rate. Thus, there is a need to promote enrichment planting and develop effective technique to support its rehabilitation and improve timber production through implementation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Genomic Selection (GS). To assist such efforts, plant materials were collected from a half-sib progeny population in Sari Bumi Kusuma forest concession, Kalimantan, Indonesia. Using 5900 markers in sequences obtained from 356 individuals, we detected high linkage disequilibrium (LD) extending up to >145 kb, suggesting that associations between phenotypic traits and markers in LD can be more easily and feasibly detected with GWAS than with analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). However, the detection power of GWAS seems low, since few single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to any focal traits were detected with a stringent false discovery rate, indicating that the species' phenotypic traits are mostly under polygenic quantitative control. Furthermore, Machine Learning provided higher prediction accuracies than Bayesian methods. We also found that stem diameter, branch diameter ratio and wood density were more predictable than height, clear bole, branch angle and wood stiffness traits.

Myanmar faces the extensive degradation of traditional production forests with a 160-year logging history, but the cause of this degradation and how to balance legal and/or illegal disturbances with recovery in over-logged forests remain unclear. The present study investigated stand structural changes over 5 years after official legal logging operations using two 1-ha (100 × 100 m) sample plots. For 5 years after logging, the volume of trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 20 cm decreased by 46.0% from 121 to 65.1 m3 ha-1, with a significant loss of the first-and second-grade species group (Tectona grandis Linn. f. and Xylia xylocarpa (Roxb.) Taub.) from 48.3 to 6.8 m3 ha-1. The total tree loss owing to official logging operations, mainly targeting the second-and fourth-grade species group, was 29.3 m3 ha-1. A similar level of total tree loss (28.0 m3 ha-1) was attributed to illegal logging that targeted the first-and second-grade species group. The mean annual recruitment rate of 3.1% was larger than the reported values for tropical forests, but there were no and only 1.5 trees ha-1 recruitments s for T. grandis and X. xylocarpa, respectively. The mean annual mortality rate of 2.5% was within the values reported in the related literature, and the volume loss from the mortality was relatively similar to the gain from the increment of living trees for all species groups. We concluded that the effects of illegal disturbances for 5 years post-harvest were equivalent to those of legal disturbances and larger than those of natural change, and are a major cause of the substantial reduction in stocking levels, especially for commercial species. © 2020 by the authors.","Illegal logging; Mortality; Recruitment; Teak; Tropical mixed deciduous forest","Mizoue, N.; Kyushu University, 744 Motooka, Japan; email: mizoue@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081129147

To date, carbon dynamics over tropical forests have been poorly assessed, especially over vast areas of the tropics that have been affected by some type of disturbance (e.g., selective logging, understory fires, and fragmentation). Understanding the multi-temporal dynamics of carbon stocks over human-modified tropical forests (HMTF) is crucial to close the carbon cycle balance in the tropics. Here, we used multi-temporal and high-spatial resolution airborne LiDAR data to quantify rates of carbon dynamics over a large patch of HMTF in eastern Amazon, Brazil. We described a robust approach to monitor changes in aboveground forest carbon stocks between 2012 and 2018. Our results showed that this particular HMTF lost 0.57 m•yr-1 in mean forest canopy height and 1.38 Mg•C•ha-1•yr-1 of forest carbon between 2012 and 2018. LiDAR-based estimates of Aboveground Carbon Density (ACD) showed progressive loss through the years, from 77.9 Mg•C•ha-1 in 2012 to 53.1 Mg•C•ha-1 in 2018, thus a decrease of 31.8%. Rates of carbon stock changes were negative for all time intervals analyzed, yielding average annual carbon loss rates of-1.34 Mg•C•ha-1•yr-1. This suggests that this HMTF is acting more as a source of carbon than a sink, having great negative implications for carbon emission scenarios in tropical forests. Although more studies of forest dynamics in HMTFs are necessary to reduce the current remaining uncertainties in the carbon cycle, our results highlight the persistent effects of carbon losses for the study area. HMTFs are likely to expand across the Amazon in the near future. The resultant carbon source conditions, directly associated with disturbances, may be essential when considering climate projections and carbon accounting methods. © 2020 by the authors.","Aboveground carbon; Airborne LiDAR; Amazon forest; Canopy height; Forest disturbance","de Moura, Y.M.; Centre for Landscape and Climate Research, United Kingdom; email: yhas.mendes@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080961530

One hypothesis is that logging influences phosphorus (P) cycling, because this scarce nutrient is removed in extracted timber and eroded soil, leading to shifts in ecosystem functioning and community composition. However, testing this is challenging because P varies within landscapes as a function of geology, topography and climate. Superimposed upon these trends are compositional changes in logged forests, with species with more acquisitive traits, characterized by higher foliar P concentrations, more dominant. It is difficult to resolve these patterns using traditional field approaches alone. Here, we use airborne light detection and ranging-guided hyperspectral imagery to map foliar nutrient (i.e. P, nitrogen [N]) concentrations, calibrated using field measured traits, over 400 km2 of northeastern Borneo, including a landscape-level disturbance gradient spanning old-growth to repeatedly logged forests. The maps reveal that canopy foliar P and N concentrations decrease with elevation. These relationships were not identified using traditional field measurements of leaf and soil nutrients. After controlling for topography, canopy foliar nutrient concentrations were lower in logged forest than in old-growth areas, reflecting decreased nutrient availability. However, foliar nutrient concentrations and specific leaf area were greatest in relatively short patches in logged areas, reflecting a shift in composition to pioneer species with acquisitive traits. N:P ratio increased in logged forest, suggesting reduced soil P availability through disturbance. Through the first landscape scale assessment of how functional leaf traits change in response to logging, we find that differences from old-growth forest become more pronounced as logged forests increase in stature over time, suggesting exacerbated phosphorus limitation as forests recover. © 2019 The Authors.

However, thinning practices intentionally designed to improve commercial timber production may alter species composition and functional composition. Low, medium, and high intensity thinning following logging plus a logged only control was applied in an Australian tropical forest in 1969 to assess the long-term liberation thinning impacts on the commercial timber volume and the functional composition of the regenerating forest. Over 46 years following thinning, only medium- and high-intensity thinning promoted recruitment of commercial trees into the &gt;10 cm diameter class. All three thinning treatments enhanced the standing volume of most desirable commercial species, mainly driven by the growth of remaining non-harvested trees in the 10–20 cm diameter class. The merchantable timber volume of other less desirable species was also promoted in the four treatments. Over the first 28 years after treatment (1969–1997), the average annual timber volume accumulation rate was highest in the medium-intensity thinning (1.97 m3 ha−1 year−1). The positive impacts of medium- and high-intensity thinning on commercial timber volume growth lasted longer than the low-intensity thinning. From 1997 to 2015, average annual volume increments increased in the medium- and high-intensity thinning, changed little in the low-intensity thinning, and decreased in the untreated control. Moreover, the medium- and high-intensity thinning led the community functional composition to shift towards early-successional species, which reduced community-weighted mean wood densities. The changes induced by intensive thinning treatments may affect the recovery of forest biomass and biodiversity. Hence, the trade-off between enhancing timber stocks and maintaining functional composition should be considered during planning and implementation of tropical forest management. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Functional groups; Growth; Logging; Thinning; Timber stock; Tropical forest; Wood density","Hu, J.; School of Agriculture and Food Sciences, Australia; email: jing.hu1@uq.net.au",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075975649

Although the role of state actors in certification mechanisms has been previously analyzed, the response of non-state forest certification actors to potentially competitive systems of legality has not yet been analyzed. The case of Argentina presented in this paper shows how a coalition between international actors such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and land owners, with great power in the country, gathered through forestry associations have managed to create a timber legality verification mechanism, even with financing from the national state. In this case, the state gives up its regulatory power and the possibility of increasing its institutional capacities vis-à-vis private actors. Addressing the response of private certification actors to legality mechanisms will allow for important and in-depths insights into the relationship between state and non-state actors and potential future joint mechanisms designed to address illegal logging and deforestation. © 2019","Argentina; Co-government; Experimentalist governments; Forest Policy; Transnational politics","Burns, S.L.; Laboratorio de Investigación de Sistemas Ecológicos y Ambientales, Argentina; email: salibu@agro.unlp.edu.ar",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074720134

However, the actual pathways through which altered microclimatic conditions reshape the ecology of these human-modified ecosystems remain largely unexplored. To bridge this knowledge gap, here we outline an agenda for future microclimate research in human-modified tropical ecosystems. We focus specifically on three main themes: the role of microclimate in shaping (i) species distributions, (ii) species interactions, and (iii) ecosystem functioning in tropical forests.

Determining liana response to selective logging chronosequence is important for understanding long-term logging effects on lianas and tropical forests. Aims: Our objective was to quantify the response of liana communities to selective logging chronosequence in a moist semi-deciduous forest in Ghana. Methods: Liana community characteristics were determined in ten 40 m × 40 m plots randomly and homogenously distributed in each of four selectively logged forest stands that had been logged 2, 14, 40 and 68 years before the surveys and in an old-growth forest stand (ca. >200 years). Results: Liana species composition differed significantly among the forest stands, as a function of logging time span, while species richness fluctuated along the chronosequence. The abundance of liana communities and of reproductive and climbing guilds was lower in the logged forests than in the old-growth forest. The ratio of liana abundance and basal area to those of trees was similar in the logged forests, but significantly lower than those in the old-growth forest.

Thus, studies aiming to analyze suitable methods to predict biomass are crucial, especially in the tropics, where dense vegetation makes modeling difficult. Thus, the objective of the present study was to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) in a tropical forest area with selective logging in the Amazon forest using the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm and LiDAR data. For this, 85 sample units were used at Fazenda Cauaxi, in the municipality of Paragominas, Pará State. LiDAR data were collected in 2014 and made available by the Sustainable Landscapes Project. The software R was used for data analysis. Among the LiDAR metrics, the average height was used as it had the greatest significance to compose the model. The model presented a pseudo R² of 0.69 (value obtained by the RF), Spearman's Correlation Coefficient of 0.80, RMSE of 47.05 Mg.ha-1 (19.84%), and Bias of 2.06 Mg.ha-1 (0.87%). With the results, it was possible to infer that the average height metric was enough to estimate AGB in a tropical forest with selective logging, in addition, the RF algorithm the biomass to be estimated, which can be used to assist in monitoring and action management in areas of selective logging and serve as a basis for climate change mitigation policies © 2020.

Tago Range in Bukidnon has been subjected to deforestation and forest fragmentation due to logging ca. 35-40 years ago or as direct result of land conversion for agriculture, human settlements and wildlife product harvesting. It is currently not a protected area. This study aimed to provide data on the tree species diversity, structure, composition, conservation status and threats of the forest habitats in the site. Tree survey in the range was conducted in 2018-2019 using thirty-nine 20 x 20 m sampling plots and six one-kilometer transect lines. A total of 1,032 tree individuals from 54 families, 85 genera and 121 species were documented. The site is composed of four tropical forest habitat types namely: lower montane rainforest, upper montane rainforest, mossy-pygmy and forest over ultramafic rocks. These forest habitats also differed in species composition, elevation, substrate, dominance and structure in terms of height and diameter at breast height. The highest diversity index was observed in the mid-elevation and decreasing toward the peak. The diversity pattern herein is attributed to elevation, forest degradation due to anthropogenic activities and nature of habitat. The most abundant families were the Myrtaceae (23%), Podocarpaceae (12.8%) and Fagaceae (12.6%). At the family level the most dominant taxa included the Moraceae (8.7%), Rubiaceae (6.5%) and Myrtaceae (5.8%). Highest importance value index (IVI) in all forest types fell within the range of IVI's for tropical forests. Assessment of conservation and ecological status revealed that 11 species (8%) are threatened, 28 (22%) Least Concern (LC) and 16 (12%) are Philippine endemics. Threats to tree diversity in Mt. Tago Range included land conversion for agriculture and settlement, illegal logging and lack of legislative protection. The implementation of conservation strategies by stakeholders is recommended to protect the tree species communities and population across the forest habitat types in the site. © 2020 Association of Systematic Biologists of the Philippines.

Selective logging can be carried out legally, in forest management areas and forest areas previously authorized for deforestation, or illegally, in any other unauthorized cases that occur in a predatory manner. In this study, the spatiotemporal dynamic of selectively logged forests in the state of Mato Grosso was assessed based on a time-series (from 1992 to 2016) of logged forests detected using remotely sensed data. Visual interpretation and semi-automatic classification of Landsat imagery were used to detect forests impacted by selective logging activities in the study area. Based on the results, it was estimated that 41,926 km2 of native forests were selectively logged at least once between 1992 and 2016 in the state of Mato Grosso, an annual average of 1,747 km2. Selectively logged forests detected showing persistent or recurrent forest disturbances were more frequently observed in the most recent years of this analysis. Most of the selectively logged forests in the study area and period have not been deforested by 2016. It indicates that selective logging is a dissociated phenomenon with deforestation in the state of Mato Grosso. It was also observed that an average of 18 km2.year-1 and 268.18 km2.year-1 of native forests was selectively logged within Conservation Units and Indigenous Lands between 1992 and 2016. A significant tendency to increase or decrease logging activities within those protected areas in the analyzed period was not observed. Selectively logged forests were persistently detected in the old timber centers located in the central-northern region of the state of Mato Grosso, showing, potentially, new cutting cycles in those previously logged forests. More recently, selective logging activities have reached the last native forest frontier in northwestern Mato Grosso. Finally, it was concluded that selective logging is annually disturbing a considerable extension of native forests in the state of Mato Grosso and, therefore, needs to be adequately considered and monitored by environmental agencies due to its potential forest impacts and to support the definition of public policies to ensure the future sustainability of forest production in that state. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

Since obtaining the variables in the field consumes time and resources and, in some cases, is not feasible due to access difficulties, the study of alternative methods has made it possible to extract information from forest areas reliably. The airborne laser systems, based on LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology, allow obtaining three-dimensional information about the earth’s surface with high precision. The objective of this study was to test the use of LiDAR data to estimate changes in canopy cover and AGB, associated with forest in the Brazilian South-Western Amazon. Overflying occurred in 2013, 2014 and 2015, before and after the exploration, together with field data collection in ten permanent plots where measurement of the diameter of all individuals with DBH ≥ 10 cm at 1.30 m above the ground was carried out. A regression model to estimate changes in AGB was developed from the LiDAR data and field data. A simple differentiation of the canopy covers, before and after the exploration, identified areas where the canopy with more than 10 m of height was removed. The mean reduction in AGB was 21.36 Mg.ha-1 (8.9%). The reduction in canopy cover was estimated at 0.08 ha (8.2%). The model can be considered satisfactory, since it presented good statistical results as Raj 2 of 0.74, RMSE of 21.10 Mg.ha-1 and test of significance F of 27.19. This work demonstrates the potential of LiDAR for quantification of canopy structural changes in tropical forests. These results indicate that LiDAR can be a valuable tool for REDD-related carbon monitoring systems and may provide a means of quantifying changes in above-ground carbon attributable to logging activities. Due to the difficulties associated with field work in remote areas, it is acceptable that the remeasurements be obtained with from LiDAR data, for the purposes of monitoring AGB changes. © 2020, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

This article examines how Cambodian forest management, long supported by international organizations, has failed. The focus here is on complicit mechanisms of international efforts in the failure of Cambodia’s forest management, rather than on well-clarified domestic politico-economic structures. Paradoxical facets of international support for Cambodia’s forest management are also elucidated. Major efforts by international stakeholders to introduce sustainable forest management (SFM) in Cambodia included projects and programs supported by the World Bank and other organizations from the 1990s to the 2000s. These included the reform of commercial logging concessions based on international standards and the introduction of community forestry based on different models. However, Cambodia continued to undergo severe deforestation in the 2010s, due to destructive timber harvesting and monoculture plantation development by groups connected with the ruling party and authoritarian states, and cash crop cultivation by local farmers, as a result of failed international efforts. Those unsuccessful efforts stemmed from dissonance among international stakeholders on how to support SFM in Cambodia and other developing countries. The failure suggests two paradoxical facets of the current globalized, pluralized TFM, particularly in developing countries like Cambodia. First, forest management in developing countries is difficult to improve as there are many stakeholders with different interests to be coordinated. Second, authoritarian political parties and states can benefit from unsuccessful TFM. © 2020, Center for Southeast Asian Studies.

Understanding their sensitivity to human disturbances should be prioritized in understudy areas for effective conservation practices. Using mist nets, this study characterized mostly understory bird communities (insectivorous, frugivorous, granivorous, and nectarivorous birds) in three habitat types (pristine forest, selectively logged forest, and young oil palm plantation) in the Talangaye rainforest, Southwest Cameroon. A total of 845 birds belonging to 27 families and 85 species were recorded in the three habitats after 294 h of mist netting. Overall, the mist-netted community was largely dominated by insectivores, followed by frugivores, nectarivores, granivores, and carnivores. Although mean species richness, abundance, and Simpson diversity index did not vary significantly among habitat types, mean species abundance and diversity index decreased in selectively logged forest and young oil palm plantation and species richness increased in both habitats. The species richness, abundance, and diversity index for insectivorous and frugivorous birds were lowest in the young oil palm plantations. For granivores, species richness and abundance increased following selective logging and the establishment of oil palm plantation. The highest mean species richness and diversity index in nectarivores were recorded in the young oil palm plantations. The study showed that selective logging and establishment of oil palm plantation had variable effects on the bird communities in the Talangaye rainforest.

Mapping selective logging impacts on The Yucatan Peninsula is important to pursuing carbon emissions reduction and biodiversity conservation goals. Objective. To evaluate The effectiveness of applying remote sensing Techniques using LANDSAT 8 OLI imagery to detect tropical forest disturbance from timber harvesting in four communally managed forests (ejidos). We further assess differences among them in Terms of implementing improved forest management (IFM) and reduced impact logging (RJL). Methodology, Vegetation indices were calculated, and forest cover classification was performed to map logged and unlogged forest and specific harvest disturbances (e.g. felling gaps, skid trails, logging roads and log landings) in annual cutting areas of 2014. Accuracy assessments were conducted based on validation points collected in the field after logging. Results. We found that 15% of the binary classifications (logged and unlogged forest) had mean overall accuracies greater than 60%. representing a fair (40 to 70%) accuracy, although mapping of specific harvesting disturbances had poor accuracy (<40%). Vegetation indices that performed the best were normalized vegetation index (NDYI). Tasseled Cap Greenness and Tasseled Cap Wetness. Ejidos that applied IFM and RIL impacted a smaller percentage of their cutting areas and less area of forest per cubic meter of timber extracted, despite similar or higher logging intensities than ejidos without improved practices. Implication. Monitoring selective logging disturbance is important to improved forest management and certification of sus ta inability. Conclusion.

In response, in Southeast Asia, enrichment planting with dipterocarp tree species is carried out in an attempt to accelerate restoration of forest structure and functioning. However, assessing the impacts of degradation (from selective logging and other causes) and subsequent restoration with field measurements is expensive and time-consuming. There is therefore a need to develop methods for the assessment of forest quality using remote sensing. Here, we use high spatial resolution satellite imagery and advanced remote sensing products to monitor the pattern and dynamics of estimated vegetation cover, Leaf Area Index (LAI), and the biomass of plots within a field-scale (500 ha) replicated and randomized manipulation that compares different forest restoration treatments with naturally regenerating controls within the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment (SBE). We also compare the biodiversity experiment plots with the surrounding area of the Malua Forest Reserve that was selectively logged for the second time in 2007. In general, satellite remote sensing detected differences in degradation between the once- and twice-logged areas as well as between the different experimental restoration treatments. We found that approximately 70% of the Malua Forest Reserve experienced a decrease of vegetation cover after the selective relogging in 2007, while the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment area that was not relogged showed increasing vegetation cover. Within the experiment, we found that plots restored using Enrichment line planting, had higher remote sensed vegetation cover (Mean ± SE: 66.90 ± 0.06 vs. 61.96 ± 0. 16) and LAI (Mean ± SE: 5.09 ± 0.03 vs. 4.61 ± 0.11) than that of unenriched plots. Among the enrichment planted plots, those planted with mixtures of (4 or 16) species exhibited higher vegetation cover (Mean ± SE: 67.72 ± 0.06 vs. 65.35 ± 0. 09) and LAI (Mean ± SE: 5.29 ± 0.04 vs. 4.82 ± 0.06) than that of monoculture plots. Overall, when our test case of the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment was viewed through the lens of remote sensing indicators, satellite imagery was able to detect changes in forest quality due to selective logging and restoration enrichment planting. Furthermore, our results suggest that diverse mixtures of planted tree seedlings enhance restoration of forest canopies compared to planting with single species. Confirmation with ground data will be needed to validate these results and to better understand the biological processes determining tropical forest degradation and restoration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","biodiversity and ecosystem functioning; Enrichment planting; Forest degradation; Forest restoration; Sabah Biodiversity Experiment; Satellite remote sensing; Selective logging","Wu, J.; State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, China; email: jwu@mail.bnu.edu.cn",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081309289

Here we provide a comprehensive overview of the importance of tropical mega-trees relative to biodiversity persistence, ecosystem services, and sociocultural value. We describe all contemporary threats to mega-trees as a result of the conversion of old-growth forests into human-degraded landscapes exposed to climate change. We reveal a myriad of taxa, functional groups and ecosystem services that are directly or indirectly supported by tropical mega-trees, such as highly illuminated crowns for epiphytes and large boles and branches sheltering many vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. Mega-trees also amplify the resource spectra associated with non-redundant niche space, including thermal buffering and extended vertical microclimates above the forest canopy. Mega-trees also make the largest contribution to forest productivity, aboveground biomass, and timber. However, protecting this resource is a major challenge due to the natural rarity of mega-trees, illegal logging, old-growth forest conversion and climate change. We argue for ‘productive forest landscapes’ as a strategy to protect mega-trees and highlight their connections with sustainable development goals and other global targets. This strategy poses economic, political, technological and social challenges, as sparing tropical forests still incurs high opportunity costs that few stakeholders can realistically afford. Despite these challenges, the future of tropical forests mega-trees and local livelihoods are inextricably linked, and productive forest landscapes would bring clear unanticipated benefits for future generations and tropical biodiversity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"Pinho, B.X.; Departamento de Botânica, Brazil; email: bxpinho@hotmail.com",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081267952

However, the loss and degradation of forests worldwide liberates this carbon and contributes 11% of total global emissions. Forest degradation is an increasing source of carbon emissions, contributing 25% in tropical forest environments; and selective logging is among the principal causes. The central objective of this study was to evaluate biomass impacts and committed carbon emissions from selective logging in two forestry communities (ejidos with common forest use and rights) in the southern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We compared emissions performance from logging operations in both ejidos, one of them certified as sustainably managed by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The species of roundwood extracted as well as the number of impacted trees from harvesting were recorded and the type of collateral damage from felling, skidding, and transport of timber was quantified. Biomass of harvested timber and impacted vegetation was estimated to calculate carbon emissions using allometric equations. Results indicated that selective logging generated 1.2 Mg m-3 and 1.5 Mg m-3 of total carbon emissions in the Caobas and 20 de Noviembre ejidos, with 5% and 12% corresponding to collateral damage during felling, respectively. Overall lower committed emissions and collateral damage from felling and skidding were present in Caobas, the FSC certified ejido. We discuss how forest certification, through implementation of reduced impact logging (RIL) practices can significantly reduce carbon emissions from selective logging in the region. © 2020, Instituto de Ecologia, A.C.

We review the consequences of timber harvesting on rainforest ecosystems, from individual species through to biological communities. We also investigate the benefits that forest-dwelling communities and wider society can derive from well-managed production forests. Selectively logged forests maintain a wide array of ecosystem services, and orders of magnitude higher levels of biodiversity and carbon storage than the agricultural lands that often imperil them. To unlock the full potential of logged forests in conserving biodiversity, tackling climate change and delivering ecosystem services into the Anthropocene will require several major transitions. These include a pantropical shift towards more environmentally sensitive logging practises, the fostering of new norms in tropical forestry based around long-term forest management, as well as coordinated efforts to limit the negative effects of logging roads, illegal logging and climate change. We discuss potential incentive and enforcement-based mechanisms for precipitating such transitions and highlight key avenues for future enquiry. Research frontiers include determining how best to spatially design logging operations to limit environmental impacts, quantifying the costs and benefits of post-logging activities aimed at recovering logged forest values, and investigating the role of concession licence structures in spawning sustainable forest management. Given their spatial dominance and high conservation value, lofty planetary goals to limit climate change and global biodiversity declines cannot be achieved unless selectively logged tropical forests take a central role in emerging conservation and emissions-reducing agendas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Forest and landscape restoration; Biodiversity; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Illegal logging; REDD +; Selective logging; Sustainable forest management","Edwards, D.P.; Department of Animal and Plant Science, United Kingdom; email: david.edwards@sheffield.ac.uk",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080989183

People modify and interact with these landscapes through a wide range of uses. However, our knowledge of how different forest uses affect biodiversity is limited. Here, we analyse the responses of different taxa to four distinct categories of forest management, namely oldgrowth forest, Brazil nut extraction areas, reduced impact logging areas, and eucalyptus plantations. Within six independent replicates of each category, we sampled three taxa (fruit-feeding butterflies, dung beetles, and trees) in eastern Amazonia. Forests under moderate use (Brazil nut extraction and reduced-impact logging) had similar, albeit slightly lower, diversity levels relative to old-growth forests, while communities in plantations were significantly less diverse. Only 4%, 20%, and 17%, of the sampled butterfly, dung beetle, and tree species, respectively, were restricted to old-growth forests. This study provides further empirical evidence of the importance of old-growth forest conservation in the context of human-modified landscapes.

To study vascular strategies for Bornean rainforest trees, we compared water transport-related anatomical characteristics in branch wood between the common tree species Vatica dulitensis (Dipterocarpaceae) from old-growth forest and the common pioneer tree species Macaranga gigantea (Euphorbiaceae) from selectively logged forest. We hypothesised that the vessel traits of the pioneer species would reflect the need to capture and transport resources to support its fast growth rate (resource-acquisitive strategy), while the species of the old-growth forest would display more conservative vessel traits (resource-conservative strategy). We found that M. gigantea had significantly greater vessel area, hydraulically weighted diameter, vessel area to number ratio, and potential hydraulic conductivity than V. dulitensis. These results suggest that vessel traits of the common old-growth species would ensure high hydraulic safety during occasional drought when soil moisture is limited, while the common species of selectively logged forest possesses an efficient water transport system but its vessels would confer lower hydraulic safety during drought conditions. These contrasting vascular strategies highlight the potential for divergent responses of species of Bornean forest trees to future climatic extremes. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia","Hydraulic conductivity; Old-growth forest; Selective logging; Trade-off; Tropical rainforest; Wood anatomical traits","Jotan, P.; Faculty of Science and Natural Resources, Malaysia; email: palasiahjotan@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079133128

There is an urgent need to conduct detailed studies on water quality condition from various land-use of Malaysia. A total of 756 water samples was collected from upstream, middle stream and downstream of river at each study area. Water quality was interpreted using National Water Quality Standard and Water Quality Index developed by the Department of Environment Malaysia and analysis implemented according to Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater by APHA was followed. The physico-chemical variables of river water of dam (Bakun), oil palm plantations (Lawas II) and agricultural area (Lawas III) were under Class III (moderate water quality) status; while river water at logging area (Mukah) was under Class IV (slightly polluted). The most influencial variables that cause the deterioration of water quality is moderately low dissolved oxygen; high concentration of ammonia nitrogen; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; major ion and trace metals; and nearly acidic pH. This study also revealed that due to conversion of tropical forest into various land-use, water quality had deteriorated significantly as was evident from variation of water quality variables. Independent samples test (t-test) showed that the selected physico-chemical variables varied significantly from disturbed and undisturbed forest (P<0.05); and found high at disturbed forest. Pearson correlation revealed the facts that all the physic-chemical variables of river water are correlated to in some ways. Any deterioration to one variable will cause deterioration to other variables. The PCA results revealed that 87.30% of the total variance was explained by five factors, that is, organic and inorganic (42.96%), salinity factors (22.11%), organic pollution (dissolved and suspended materials) (8.61%), waste water pollution from agricultural and organic load (7.07%) and erosion factor (6.56%) that represent total variance of water quality in the disturbed forest. Overall, these results highlight the sensitivity of river water towards quality changes which may be altered as a result of both, extensive land management and natural ecosystem disturbances. © 2020 Forestry Department of Peninsular Malaysia.

Its most common definition relates to the degree to which a resource is similar to its original state. Hence, we developed a naturalness assessment method for the Brazilian Araucaria forest. We used data collected within 145 systematically distributed plots over an area of ~56 000 km2. We selected five indicators to compose a unified naturalness index: (i) evidence of human activities inside the forest stand; (ii) abundance of naturalness-indicator species; (iii) standard deviation of diameter at breast height (Sdbh); (iv) species diversity of the understory–natural regeneration layer; and (v) forest stand landscape metrics. We then calculated the Euclidean distance between the vector generated from the indicators of an ordinary forest stand and the vector generated from a theoretical reference forest (TRF) with maximum naturalness. The reduced Sdbh reflected the stands’ diminished structural diversity as result of historical logging and other ongoing human activities. Most stands presented average naturalness compared with the TRF. Besides the lack of data on undisturbed forests to thoroughly evaluate the naturalness index, evidence suggested that it summarized relevant forest attributes to the extent that protected areas presented greater naturalness than nonprotected areas. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

Forests allocated to conservation, production and community management are expected to have different conservation values. Here, we aimed to identify the determinants of the conservation value of tropical forests in southeastern Cameroon, by disentangling the effects of forest allocations, proximity to human settlements, and local habitat. We inventoried two taxonomical groups: mammal species with camera traps (3464 independent detection events) and dung beetle species with pitfall traps (4475 individuals). We used an integrated analytical approach, examining both species richness and composition. For both mammals and dung beetles, species richness decreased from the protected area to the community forests, and the logging concession showed intermediate richness. Species richness of both groups was negatively correlated to the proximity to human settlements and disturbance, with a decreasing gradient of body mass and the loss of the most threatened species. The replacement (i.e., spatial turnover) of both mammal and dung beetle species among forest allocations suggest an integration of conservation initiatives to a large number of different sites, with a priority on protected and remote areas of high biodiversity.

One potential revenue source for restoration is selective harvesting of timber, a product for which there is a clear global market and increasing demand. The use of commercially valuable exotic trees may attract farmers to restoration, but can be a major concern for ecologists. Here, we present results collected over 7 years from experimental studies at three sites across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to assess the impacts of incorporating exotic eucalypts as a transitional stage in tropical forest restoration on above-ground biomass accumulation, native woody species regeneration and financial viability. Biomass accumulation was nine times greater in mixed eucalypt-native species plantations than native only plantings due to fast eucalypt growth. Nonetheless, the growth of native non-pioneer trees was not affected or only slightly reduced by eucalypts prior to logging. Eucalypts did not negatively affect the natural regeneration of native woody species before or after eucalypt logging. Canopy cover regrew quickly but was slightly lower a year following logging in mixed eucalypt-native species plantations. Natural regeneration richness and planted non-pioneer growth were similar across treatments in the post-logging period. We found higher variation of biomass accumulation and native species regeneration among sites than between plantation types within sites. The income from eucalypt wood production offset 44%–75% of restoration implementation costs. Synthesis and applications. Many of the negative effects attributed to eucalypts on the growth and natural regeneration of native trees depend on features of the production system, landscape structure, soil, and climate in which they are grown, rather than the effects of eucalypts per se. In Brazil's Atlantic Forest region, exotic eucalypts can become important allies of tropical forest restoration, and their use and investment opportunities should be considered within the portfolio of options supported by public and private funding and policies. © 2019 The Authors.

However, the impacts of forest degradation are currently understudied and poorly understood, in comparison to deforestation, which is easier to be detected and thus more ready to be quantified and monitored. In order to understand better the contributing factors of Indonesia's GHG emissions profiles from the forestry sector as well as taking the opportunity to tackle climate change, improving knowledge on GHG emissions from forest degradation is essential. Both literature review and simulation using a carbon accounting model were used in the analysis. National emissions profile of Indonesia has been reported to the UNFCCC, in which forest degradation has been one of the sources of emissions, although its emission value tended to be underestimated and may contain high uncertainty. It is because logging and fires in secondary forests have not been fully captured as sources of emissions, as well as post-disturbance growth that potentially enhance forest carbon stocks. This study clearly shows the importance of calculating GHG emissions from forest degradation caused by anthropogenic activities (logging, fires). It is suggested that accuracy can be improved by using a system approach that occurs in the ecosystem carbon cycle through modeling that can capture the flow of carbon following the disturbance events. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Accuracy; disturbance; forest degradation; GHG emission; model","Adinugroho, W.C.; Natural Resources and Environment Management Study Program, Indonesia; email: wahyuk2001@yahoo.com",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078238208

In Amazonia, the largest tropical forest on Earth, a sixth of the remaining natural forests is formally dedicated to timber extraction through selective logging. Reconciling timber extraction with the provision of other ecosystem services (ES) remains a major challenge for forest managers and policy-makers. This study applies a spatial optimisation of logging in Amazonian production forests to analyse potential trade-offs between timber extraction and recovery, carbon storage, and biodiversity conservation. Current logging regulations with unique cutting cycles result in sub-optimal ES-use efficiency. Long-term timber provision would require the adoption of a land-sharing strategy that involves extensive low-intensity logging, although high transport and road-building costs might make this approach economically unattractive. By contrast, retention of carbon and biodiversity would be enhanced by a land-sparing strategy restricting high-intensive logging to designated areas such as the outer fringes of the region. Depending on management goals and societal demands, either choice will substantially influence the future of Amazonian forests. Overall, our results highlight the need for revaluation of current logging regulations and regional cooperation among Amazonian countries to enhance coherent and trans-boundary forest management. © 2019 The Author(s).

Such knowledge can be the result of scientific investigation, but important insight can also reside in observant local land managers. In seasonally dry tropical forests in southern Ecuador, recent decades have seen important advances in the knowledge of the biodiversity values of these forests, but the available data have not yet been integrated and translated into tools that support managers in deciding restoration measures. One powerful framework to organize and communicate information about ecosystem degradation and recovery dynamics is the state-transition model. We generated such a model by combining ecologist and local knowledge obtained through an adaptation of the Stanford/SRI expert elicitation protocol. Through this information, we identified five forest states with specific attributes of vegetation, human pressures, and restoration needs. Ecologists and locals agreed on the restoration actions but partially disagreed on the causes of degradation. Whereas ecologists considered that grazing management, often introduced with or after logging, was the catalyst for a transition to degraded states, locals attributed those transitions to the effects of logging alone. Importantly, however, both ecologists and locals considered that exclusion of livestock grazing was a necessary action to promote ecological recovery. A forward-looking strategy focusing on objectives for ecosystem recovery and ecosystem management for biodiversity and human well-being might be more successful than strategies that emphasize or seek to attribute responsibility for degradation. © 2019 by the author(s).","Conservation status; Desertification; Dry forest; Drylands; Forest management; State-transition model",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077885084

There was a clear differentiation of functional composition between OG and SL plots along the first principal component, indicated by a distinct clustering of the study plots. Tree communities in OG plots were characterized by greater investment in defence and tissue density, whereas SL tree communities expressed higher photosynthetic activity and reduced investment into structural components (Table 2). Old-growth forests were characterized by denser wood and tougher leaves. These traits reflect enhanced structural investment, implying longer leaf life span and slower growth rates. Tree communities in SL forest had higher photosynthetic activity represented by higher CWM values of maximum photosynthetic rate, light-saturated photosynthetic rate, and dark respiration (Amax, Asat and Rd, respectively). These higher rates of gas exchange were supported by the expression of higher CWM area-based pigment concentrations in SL communities and higher Na and Nm concentrations. Tree communities in SL were enriched in 13C compared with OG communities, indicating greater water-use efficiency. The second axis of functional trait space represented tissue nutrient concentrations and leaf area, but was independent of logging history (Fig. 2). This axis reflects covariation among CWM values of leaf area, leaf Pm, Pa, Mgm and Cam concentrations, and a negative association of these traits with leaf Cm and tannin concentrations. Variability of these traits within both logged and unlogged forests was high, which suggests that the expression of these traits is driven by underlying soil properties rather than by logging history. Results, subsection ‘Variance partitioning’ (pp. 1857–1858) should read: Partitioning the community-level response of traits to logging and the first two principal components of soil properties showed that these factors explained up to 96% of the variation in traits. Overall, the proportion of variance explained was, on average, 73.4% (Fig. 3; Table S4). To present these results, we group the functional traits based on their main association with leaf nutrients, photosynthesis or structure. Variation in mass-based concentrations of leaf Cam, Pm and Km and, to a lesser extent, Mgm were associated with variation in soil properties, both with soil PC1 and 2. Particularly soil PC1, enveloping a gradient from exchangeable Mg to CEC and total P, strongly affected the variance in leaf Cam, Pm, Pa and Cm. For leaf traits related to photosynthesis, 3.1–88.2% of variance was explained by logging and a smaller proportion by soil PC1 (1.2–63.0%) or soil PC2 (0.9–48.8%; Table S4). Structural traits were explained by a combination of both logging history and the independent effects of soil properties. Logging explained, on average, 39.8% of variance in traits reflecting tissue density and structural investment, such as specific force to punch and branch wood density, which had consistently lower values in logged forest plots. Community-weighted mean LDMC was unusual in that it was poorly explained by all the predictor variables. By contrast, leaf size, expressed as CWM leaf area and leaf mass, increased with increasing values of soil PC1, which was linked toplots with higher total N and exchangeable Ca concentrations (Fig. 1). There was an increase in CWM tannin concentrations in logged forest plots and at lower values of soil PC1. Results, subsection ‘Functional diversity’ (pp. 1857–1858, first sentence) should read: Functional diversity, expressed as Rao's Q, did not differ between forest types (Fig. 4; F1,6 = 0.26, P = 0.63), and neither logging nor soil properties explained a significant proportion of its variance (Fig. 3). Fig. 2 and associated legend (p. 1858) should read: (Figure presented.) Fig. 2 Principal component analysis (PCA) of plot-level community-weighted mean functional traits. Plots cluster by logging history, with increased values of traits that maximize carbon capture and growth in logged forest communities and greater allocation to issue persistence and structural stability in old-growth forests. The highest loadings on the first axis are branch wood density (4.58%), Chlbm (4.58%), Chlba (4.52%), Specific force to punch (4.50%), Amax (4.36%) and Asat (4.35%). The highest loadings on the second axis are Pm (7.57%), Pa (7.44%), Tannins (6.45%), Cm (6.37%) and leaf area (5.88%). Mass-based nutrients are denoted by subscript ‘m’ and area-based values by subscript ‘a’. See Supporting Information Table S3 for all PCA loadings. Rd, dark respiration; LDMC, leaf dry matter content. Discussion, first paragraph, second sentence (p. 1858) should read: Logging was the primary driver of variation in CWM values of functional traits (Fig. 2), and explained more variation than the sum of the two soil PC axes for 18 of 32 traits (Fig. 3). Table 2 (p. 1859) should read: Table 2 Results from linear regression models from which the explained variance was generated; factors are the categorical ‘forest type’ (old growth (OG), selectively logged (SL)), and continuous ‘soil PC1’ and ‘soil PC2’.

Fig. 3 Proportion of variance in community-weighted mean functional trait values explained by forest type and the first two principal components (PC) of soil properties (Fig. 1). Functional traits are grouped by the ecosystem function to which they most contribute. Statistical significance is derived from linear regression models following false discovery rate correction, asterisks indicate P &lt; 0.05, and ‘+’ and ‘−’ indicate the direction of the relationship. For forest type, ‘+’ indicates that trait values were greater in selectively logged than in old-growth forests (i.e. positive with first PC axis in Fig. 2). For variance explained by soil, ‘+’ indicates a positive relationship with the respective PC axis. See Table 2 and Supporting Information Table S4 for detailed results. Discussion, second paragraph, third sentence (p. 1861) should read: Thus, species in logged forest communities expressed higher CWM values of area-based N, photosynthetic activity and lamina thickness, whereas old-growth forest communities expressed low CWM values of these traits and higher values of traits conferring structural stability and resistance to herbivory, such as branch wood density and leaf toughness. Discussion, third paragraph, first sentence (p. 1861) should read: We observed marginally lower CWM values of SLA in logged forests, in contrast to results from French Guiana (Baraloto et al.,), and contrary to the expectation that SLA scales positively with Amax, foliar Na, and foliar Pa concentrations among species (Wright et al.,).

However, conservation of these areas is challenging because of increasing human threats, including selective logging, large-scale plantation, and wildlife hunting. We conducted line transect surveys to investigate the effects of human disturbance on the population of Victoria crowned pigeon (Goura victoria) in the lowland forest of northern Papua, Indonesia. Estimated densities of G. victoria were highest in secondary forest with 7.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.7-16.1] birds km-2 and in natural forest habitat with 6.9 (95% CI: 3.2-14.7) birds km-2 but much lower in logged forest with 2.3 (95% CI: 0.8-6.8) birds km-2. At transect level, there were positive correlations of encounter rates of G. victoria with canopy cover, fruiting trees, and distance to village and negative ones with ground cover, understory layer, logging debris, and wildlife traps. The results suggest that G. victoria is tolerant to moderate disturbance but suffers from severe disturbance. To protect crowned pigeons and other endemic Papuan fauna, impacts of logging and wildlife hunting must be reduced through law enforcement and integrated forest management strategies with proper involvement of all stakeholders, especially local people. © 2019 National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA)","Crowned pigeons; Endemic birds; Forest structure; Logging; Wildlife hunting","Pangau-Adam, M.Z.; Biology Department, Indonesia; email: mpangau1@uni-goettingen.de",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072258183

We assessed the ability of tropical forests in Indonesia to recover carbon following conventional logging. We evaluated carbon re-growth of 10,415 trees in permanent sample plots (PSPs) in East Kalimantan. Four different post-harvesting silvicultural treatments including liberation, refining, thinning, and control were applied in the PSPs. We estimated the carbon recovery period using three different scenarios of total carbon losses due to logging. In the first scenario, we used an existing factor of logging damage and increased it for assuming the range of carbon losses due to different logging practices. Results: Under the existing conventional logging practice, the concession annually emits 51.18 tC∙ha− 1, of which 16.8% are extracted from the forest as raw timber, 38% are logging losses, and 45.2% are emissions due to infrastructure development for logging operation. Increasing the logging damage factor two and three times led to an increase in carbon emission to 70.76 and 90.34 tC∙ha− 1, respectively. The recovery time of the aboveground carbon is 26 years in Scenario 1, 36 years in Scenario 2, and 46 years in Scenario 3. We found no significant effect of the silvicultural treatment type on carbon recovery, but significant effect of the sites was observed. Conclusions: We found that the time taken to restore the carbon to the level found in undisturbed forests is considerably longer than the current intervention cycles. The time needed to recover biomass and carbon-stock noticeably depends on the intensity of logging interventions, demonstrating the benefits of using improved harvesting e.g., reduced impact logging to reduce emissions. The study found that site variability has a significant effect on the carbon recovery time. Different silvicultural treatments, on the other hand, have no effect on the recovery time. The study suggests that it is not appropriate to establish an intervention cycle based on arbitrary choice; the time between interventions must be based on logging losses and site specific growth potential to ensure sustainable management of forests. © 2019, The Author(s).","Above-ground biomass; Carbon recovery; Logging cycle; Silvicultural treatment; Timber growth","Butarbutar, T.; University of Hamburg, Leuschnerstr. 91, Germany; email: tunggul.butarbutar@giz.de",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071663287

Numerous large-scale infrastructure projects aimed at promoting land-development activities are planned or ongoing in the region. However, little is known of the potential impacts of this new infrastructure on Bornean forests or biodiversity. We found that planned and ongoing road and rail-line developments will have many detrimental ecological impacts, including fragmenting large expanses of intact forest. Assuming conservatively that new road and rail projects will influence only a 1 km buffer on either side, landscape connectivity across the region will decline sharply (from 89% to 55%) if all imminently planned projects proceed. This will have particularly large impacts on wide-ranging, rare species such as rhinoceros, orangutans, and elephants. Planned developments will impact 42 protected areas, undermining Indonesian efforts to achieve key targets under the Convention on Biological Diversity. New infrastructure will accelerate expansion in intact or frontier regions of legal and illegal logging and land colonization as well as illicit mining and wildlife poaching. The net environmental, social, financial, and economic risks of several imminent projects—such as parallel border roads in West, East, and North Kalimantan, new Trans-Kalimantan road developments in Central Kalimantan and North Kalimantan, and freeways and rail lines in East Kalimantan—could markedly outstrip their overall benefits.

Thus, logged tropical forest represents critical strongholds of global biodiversity. The ability of these forests to rapidly recover their baseline thermal environmental conditions will markedly influence their conservation value, particularly under global climate change. We investigated the impacts of commercial selective logging on the forest thermal environment in the Brazilian Amazon by relating canopy disturbance from logging to ambient understorey and ground surface temperatures. Specifically, we assessed the impact of selective logging on the forest thermal heterogeneity; how much post-harvest time is required for the thermal environment of logging gaps and logging roads return to unlogged primary forest levels; and the spatial availability of surface microclimates considering time of recovery since logging. Logging gaps following 1 year of recovery had a hotter understorey ambient than all other environments, especially during peak midday temperatures. Compared to the unlogged understorey, logging gaps after 3 years of recovery were only marginally warmer, and logging gaps after 5 years of recovery were slightly cooler. Older wide roads (5 years; 6 m) experienced very similar understorey thermal conditions than both narrow roads (3 m) after 1-5 years of recovery, and unlogged forest. Ground surface temperatures exhibited the largest discrepancies among all environments. The temperature range spanned by surface microclimates notably increased during peak midday heat in logging gaps following 1 year of recovery. Additionally, the proportion of cool area was smaller in younger logging gaps, but the average size of cool patches and their spatial aggregation was similar to that in unlogged forest. Although commercial selective logging can severely damage tropical forest structure, we found that the forest can fairly rapidly regain its thermal environment. Post-logging forest management should carefully focus on preventing fire incursions and illegal activities with special attention to those 3-5 years post-harvest. Thermal homeostasis in selectively logged tropical forests can be vital for long-term maintenance of global biodiversity under contemporary scenarios of climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Microclimate; Selective logging; Tropical forest","Mollinari, M.M.; Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, United Kingdom; email: m.m.mollinari@sheffield.ac.uk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069694658

We established 50 20-m radius plots (0.12 ha in area) across primary to highly degraded forests in each of two logging concessions with distances in between any two plots ranging from 0.2 to 40 km. In addition, we established one 100 × 200-m plot in each of primary, reduced-impact logged, and conventionally logged forest in other two logging concessions, and each plot was divided into 40 × 30-m quadrats (0.12 ha in area) for the further analysis of the spatial structure at the scale of less than 200 m. A decline of species-compositional similarity with increasing in-between distance was found in primary and moderately logged forest at both larger and smaller than 0.2-km scale. Such a spatial structure could not be detected in heavily logged forests at both scales. The heavily logged forests were rather characterized by mosaics of remnant stands and regenerating patches of pioneer species, leading to a high spatial variance of species composition without the distance-dependent spatial structure. Accordingly, high-impact conventional logging damages the distance-dependent spatial structure of species composition in canopy tree communities by creating random vegetation patches, while reduced-impact logging can maintain the spatial structure. © 2019, © 2019 The Japanese Forest Society.","Borneo; conventional logging; reduced-impact logging; sustainable forest management; tree community composition","Imai, N.; Department of Forest Science, Sakuragaoka 1-1-1, Setagaya, Japan; email: i96nobuo@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073920460

To fill these knowledge gaps, we explored the effects of land-use change on the ecologically important and threatened bearded pig (Sus barbatus) over seven years in Borneo. Random placement of camera traps across a land-use gradient of primary forest, logged forest, and oil palm plantations (32,542 trap nights) resulted in 2,303 independent capture events. Land-use was associated with changes in the age structure and activity patterns of photographed individuals, alongside large changes in abundance shown previously. The proportion of adults recorded declined from 92% in primary forests to 76% in logged forests, and 67% in plantations, likely indicating increased fecundity in secondary forests. Activity level (capture rate) did not vary, but activity patterns changed markedly, from diurnal in primary forests, crepuscular in logged forests, to nocturnal in plantations. These changes corresponded with avoidance of diurnal human activity and may also protect bearded pigs from increased thermal stress in warmer degraded forests. The percentage of adult captures that were groups rather than individuals increased five-fold from primary forests (4%) to logged forests (20%), possibly due to increased mating or in response to perceived threats from indirect human disturbance. We recommend further investigation of the demographic and behavioral effects of land-use change on keystone species as altered population structure, activity patterns, and social behavior may have knock-on effects for entire ecosystems. © 2019 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","activity pattern; borneo; mammal; oil palm; population structure; primary tropical forest; selective logging; social behavior","Davison, C.W.; Department of Life Sciences, United Kingdom; email: charles.w.davison@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075388346

While the impacts of logging on species diversity and distributions are well understood, little is known about the effects of logging on animal behaviours central to individual fitness and population persistence. The song rate of breeding songbirds is a behavioural trait that is often positively associated with male density and used by conspecific females as an indicator of territory and male quality. Thus, contrasting logging-induced adjustments in song rates of individual birds with population shifts may illuminate potential mechanisms underlying population distributions. We present a novel application of bioacoustic monitoring, integrating counts of individuals, songs and duets from single automated recording units (ARUs) with N-mixture models, to estimate shifts in population parameters (occupancy, abundance) and singing behaviours (per-capita song rates, per-pair duet rates) of 32 Bornean songbird species with logging. We tested hypotheses on the relationships between adjustments in behavioural and population parameters with logging, and further tested the extent to which species traits predicted behavioural and population shifts. Adjustments to singing behaviour in 59 and 53% of species (57% of duetting species) were concordant with differences in occupancy and abundance respectively, such that species showing reduced populations with logging also produced fewer songs per-capita, and vice versa. Species known to prefer undisturbed habitats and large-bodied species showed the most negative effects of logging on singing behaviour and population distributions. Species known to exploit degraded habitats exhibited the opposite pattern. Subdued singing in logged forests by species of conservation concern suggests limited competition between territorial males in small populations and may also signal low-quality territories. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that bioacoustic monitoring can be used to not only estimate important population parameters of occupancy and abundance across a diverse tropical songbird community, but also enables quantification of behaviours considered relevant to individual fitness, yet unobtainable with conventional methods (e.g. point counts). Bioacoustics provides a viable approach to reliable automated large-scale monitoring of hyperdiverse tropical forest systems under logging operations and other land-use pressures. © 2019 The Authors.

By using soundscape recordings across broad spatial scales, we measured soundscape saturation and dissimilarity of pairs of soundscapes, as a proxy of alpha and beta diversity, respectively, in selectively logged and protected tropical forest in Indonesian Borneo. Soundscapes of selectively logged forests were more homogeneous than the soundscapes of never logged forest, and that soundscape saturation of protected forest was higher during the day and lower at night in comparison with selective logging concessions.

Mortality increased through time, EP1 presented the highest mortality rates of all treatments in the first, sixth and 11th year, TNER had the lowest at the same period. TNER and EP2 presented the highest basal area and EP2 the highest periodic annual increment. Effects of the silvicultural treatment TNER were positive, since it presented the highest survival and a high mean basal area of the initial trees.

Results from a Faustmann model with data for a tropical forest on Kalimantan show that up to 50% of the basal area of the stand before harvest can consist of injured trees. Considering injured trees leads to an increase in the amount of carbon in above-ground biomass of up to 165%. These effects are larger under reduced impact logging than under conventional logging. The effects on land expectation value and cutting cycle are relatively small. The results suggest that considering injured trees in models for tropical forest management is important for the correct assessment of the potential of financial programs to store carbon and conserve forest ecosystem services in managed tropical forests, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and payment for ecosystem services.

They will be more diminished in size and heavily fragmented (especially in lowland wet forests), have reduced structural and species complexity, be increasingly restricted to steeper, less accessible areas, and be missing many heavily hunted species. These changes, in turn, will greatly reduce the quality and quantity of ecosystem services that tropical forests can provide. Driving these changes will be continued clearance for farming and monoculture forest plantations, unsustainable selective logging, overhunting, and, increasingly, climate change. Concerted action by local and indigenous communities, environmental groups, governments, and corporations can reverse these trends and, if successful, provide future generations with a tropical forest estate that includes a network of primary forest reserves robustly defended from threats, recovering logged and secondary forests, and resilient community forests managed for the needs of local people.

Radio frequency identification (RFID) is increasingly used in log-tracking systems. The RFID tags currently available on the market are not directly suitable for forestry applications, however, unless the tags are protected by a housing. Harsh working environments mean that tag housings must be robust in order to keep their valuable information safe throughout a logging operation. The aim of this study was to provide a testing method for use as a decision-making tool by RFID users. The study used five tests to evaluate the applicability of eight kinds of tag housing for forestry applications. The tests considered climatic aspects, mechanical stress, readability and survival in the field. The method was found to work well with tested tag housings, revealing their strengths and weaknesses. Using the testing method, a procedure is recommended to determine the most appropriate tag housing. © 2019, © 2019 Institute of Foresters of Australia (IFA).","casing; logging; RFID UHF; testing; timber source of origin; traceability","Kaakkurivaara, N.; Faculty of Forestry, 50 Ngamwongwan Road, Ladyao, Chatuchak, Thailand; email: ffornrm@ku.ac.th",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074887912

In the Brazilian Amazon, the intensive use of high-value timber species is leading to a decline in their populations. When in decline, these species can be replaced by less valuable and more common ones that are more feasible to exploit. We conducted interviews with residents of two communities in a sustainable development reserve in central Amazonia, and used free lists and the cognitive salience index (S) to assess the perceptions of residents regarding the occurrence and purpose of timber exploitation, and to identify possible endangered species in white-sand and terra-firme forests. In addition, to infer possible consequences of logging, we assessed the current population status of timber species cited by residents in forest-plot inventories carried out within the reserve. S-index values and interviewee reports suggested an intensive use of terra-firme timber species and an apparently recent increase in the exploitation of white-sand species, which did not use to be exploited because of their relatively low commercial value. The inventories showed that the white-sand timber species have high relative densities and low S values in contrast to the terra-firme species, which mostly have low relative densities and high S values. Our results highlight the need to identify and monitor relevant timber species in both terra-firme and white-sand forests, and to increase the involvement of the local community in the development of logging management practices. © 2019, (publisher Name).

Although such anthropogenic disturbance typically results in the loss of biodiversity, many species persist, and their conservation in production landscapes could be enhanced by a greater understanding of how biodiversity responds to forest management practices. We conducted intensive camera-trap surveys of eight protected forest areas in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, and developed estimates of Sunda clouded leopard Neofelis diardi population density from spatially explicit capture-recapture analyses of detection data to investigate how the species' abundance varies across the landscape and in response to anthropogenic disturbance. Estimates of population density from six forest areas were 1.39-3.10 individuals per 100 km2. Our study provides the first evidence that the population density of the Sunda clouded leopard is negatively affected by hunting pressure and forest fragmentation, and that among selectively logged forests, time since logging is positively associated with abundance. We argue that these negative anthropogenic impacts could be mitigated with improved logging practices, such as reducing the access of poachers by effective gating and destruction of road access points, and by the deployment of anti-poaching patrols. By calculating a weighted mean population density estimate from estimates developed here and from the literature, and by extrapolating this value to an estimate of current available habitat, we estimate there are 754 (95% posterior interval 325-1,337) Sunda clouded leopards in Sabah. © 2017 Fauna & Flora International.","Borneo; forest management; Neofelis diardi; population density; selective logging; spatially explicit capture recapture; Sunda clouded leopard","Hearn, A.J.; Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, United Kingdom; email: andrew.hearn@zoo.ox.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030864102

Extensive plantings of non-native species now are found in Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay. In Colombia, miscellaneous plantations were established in the 1950s, during a period of intensive local logging, when policies to limit deforestation in native Quercus humboldtii forests were established. One unforeseen consequence of planting non-native trees was the simultaneous introduction and subsequent persistence of ectomycorrhizal fungi. We sought to document the origins and spread of the introduced Amanita muscaria found in Colombian plantations of the Mexican species Pinus patula, North American species P. taeda, and Australian species Acacia melanoxylon and Eucalyptus globulus. In Colombia, Amanita muscaria is establishing a novel association with native Q. humboldtii and has spread to local Q. humboldtii forests. According to a Bayesian phylogeny and haplotype analysis based on the nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer region ITS1-5.8-ITS2 (ITS barcode), A. muscaria individuals found in four exotic plant species, and those colonizing Q. humboldtii roots, have a Eurasian origin and belong to two Eurasian haplotypes.

The study area is a forested landscape mosaic after slash and burn agriculture (Ac: 8-23 years ago), selective logging (Fs: 43-53 years ago), and selective logging and forest fire (Fc: 21-28 years ago). The site is located in the central part of Quintana Roo, México, where three vegetation patches were delineated according to remotely sensed multiespectral imagery. Mean differences between vegetation structure properties of each vegetation patch were obtained through a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (P < 0.001). Species richness, stem density per hectare, and the axis-1 scores of the non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination of specific composition were identified as the vegetation attributes more relevant to differentiate the vegetation patches by a multinomial logistic model. Fc vegetation patch is characterized by the greatest mean values on Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, and stem density. The Fs has the greatest mean values of canopy height, basal area, and biomass at 80 percentile, and the Ac vegetation patch has the lowest values of all mentioned metrics. The species with the greatest relative importance value were: Ac: Bursera simaruba and Piscidia piscipula, Fs: Gymnanthes lucida and Manilkara zapota, Fc: G. lucida and B. simaruba. The uncertainty associated with the metrics assessed by vegetation patch was smaller than the uncertainty of the whole area, because of the efficient variability aggregation of the field data. We conclude that multiespectral information is a reliable tool for distinguishing vegetation patches with specific features, as stem density, specific composition, and species richness. © 2019, Universidad de Costa Rica.

Background and Objectives: Functional traits have a potential to incorporate community dynamics into the impacts of disturbance histories or environmental conditions on ecosystem functioning, but few studies have been conducted to understand these processes. Materials and Methods: We measured plant functional traits and soil properties in the tropical montane rainforests on Hainan Island, China, which had experienced different disturbance histories (clear cutting, selective logging, and old-growth) 40 years ago. A structural equation model was used to elucidate how disturbance histories and soil factors influence aboveground biomass (AGB) across different size classes (saplings, treelets, and adult trees) through plant functional traits. Results: The results demonstrated logging stimulated seedling establishment but decreased AGB of adult trees and wood density at community-level (CWM_WD) of sapling and adult tree. Generally, CWM_WD of sapling, treelet, and adult tree decreased linearly with the increasing of specific leaf area at community-level (CWM_SLA) in old-growth forest and these two disturbed forests. Moreover, CWM_SLA explained more variation ofCWM_WDwith increasing intensity of logging within sapling, treelet, and adult tree. CWM_SLA and CWM_WD not only responded to environmental conditions and disturbance intensity but also affected AGB in all size classes; meanwhile, CWM_SLA was a major driver of AGB. CWM_SLA had a stronger effect on AGB in sapling and treelet classes than on the adult tree class. Conclusions: Our results suggested that disturbance history and environmental factors could directly or indirectly affect ecosystem functioning through plant functional traits. Functional traits always had a stronger effect on AGB than environmental conditions. Moreover, CWM_SLA is a key trait that can be used to link the relationship between environmental conditions and AGB. © 2019 by the authors.","Aboveground biomass; Functional traits; Logging; Soil organic carbon content; Soil water content; Specific leaf area; Wood density","Zang, R.; Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Environment of State Forestry Administration, China; email: zangrung@caf.ac.cn",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072576715

Besides strict protection, the sustainable management of natural forests should be enhanced as a key part of the foundation for the maintenance of tropical rain forest ecosystems. Due to methodological reasons it has been complicated to attain reliable growth data to plan sustainable felling cycles and rotation periods. Tree ring analyses enable the estimation of growth rates over the entire life span of trees and their age as well as giving hints from forest dynamics in previous centuries. For tree ring analysis, stem disk samples were taken from three important commercial tree species (Cariniana micrantha, Caryocar villosum and Manilkara huberi) in the upland (terra firme) forests of the Precious Woods Amazon logging company near Itacoatiara, Brazil. Based on radiocarbon estimates of individual growth zones, the annual nature of tree rings was proven for the three species. Tree rings were measured and the results used together with height estimates to model diameter, height and volume growth. The age of the eldest tree, a C. micrantha, was 585 yrs with 165 cm in diameter. The species’ diameter increments range from 0.20±0.12 cm yr-1 to 0.29±0.08 cm yr-1. At first sight, this is considerably lower than increments reported from other Amazonian or African timber species. Considering the respective wood density there is no significant difference in growth performance of dominant timber species across continents. The interpretation of lifetime tree ring curves indicate differences in shadow tolerance among species, the persistence of individuals in the understory for up to 150 years and natural stand dynamics without major disturbances. Management criteria should be adapted for the measured growth rates as they differed considerably from the Brazilian standards fixed by laws (felling cycle of 25–35 years and a common minimum logging diameter of 50 cm). Felling cycles should be increased to 32–51 years and minimum logging diameters to 63–123 cm depending on the species. © 2019 Worbes, Schöngart.

For the first time in Central Africa, we assessed the perceptions of ES provided by tropical forests to local populations, considering three land allocation types: a protected area, a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concession, and three community forests. We conducted a questionnaire survey with 225 forest stakeholders in southeastern Cameroon, combining an open-ended question and 16 directed questions to evaluate the perceptions of ES significance and abundance, respectively. The ES most frequently reported as significant were provisioning (93% of respondents) and cultural & amenity services (68%), whereas regulating services were less mentioned (16%). Bushmeat provision was the only ES perceived as highly significant but not very abundant. There were slight variations of perceptions among forest land allocation types and respondents, suggesting a relative homogeneity in ES abundance. For further integrative ES assessment, we suggest quantifying ES with complementary ecological and economic approaches, such as meat provision, recreation, tourism, timber provision, spiritual experience, firewood provision, water quality regulation, and inspiration for culture.

Results showed lower tree species richness (S), diversity (H′), evenness (S) and basal area (BA) in the SL (46, 0.78, 0.32 and 269.12 m2 ha−1, respectively) and AF (40, 0.53, 0.45, and 131.16 m2 ha−1) sites compared to the RF site (79, 2.66, 0.87, 963.72 m2 ha−1).

Post-logging interventions that accelerate forest timber and carbon recovery—such as enrichment planting and cutting of woody vines—may reduce both the spatial extent of logging and economic pressures to convert forests, delivering considerable conservation benefits. However, they could also seriously undermine logged forest biodiversity, simplifying forest structure and removing important wildlife microhabitats. To date, no study has investigated the impact of post-logging interventions on invertebrates. Focusing on dung beetles, we explore the effects of intensive vine-cutting and enrichment planting within a largescale post-logging silvicultural project in northern Borneo. We find that for four measures of functional diversity (the facet of diversity that accounts for species traits and functions) and for species richness, treated forest communities are similar to those in unlogged and naturally regenerating forest. Moreover, although community composition in treated forest remains distinct from old-growth forest, it is no different than that in naturally regenerating forest and in fact more closely resembles old-growth than naturally regenerating forest in terms of effective diversity. Our results indicate that logged forests continue to host diverse and functioning dung beetle communities even after silvicultural intensification. Post-logging interventions could therefore play an important role in forest and biodiversity conservation via their incorporation into emerging agendas including REDD+ and the Bonn Challenge. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Enrichment planting; Lianas; REDD+; Restoration; Silviculture; Sustainable forest management","Cerullo, G.R.; Department of Animal and Plant Scinces, United Kingdom; email: gcerullo95@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065065064

Bacterial and fungal community structures were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA and ITS genes. Six microbial enzyme activities involved in the cycling of C, N and P were studied. Our results showed that the aboveground forest structure was recovering towards native evergreen broad-leaved forest after selective logging. The alpha-diversity of fungal community was significantly increased across the chronosequence of logging, but the alpha-diversity of bacterial community was not. Fungal community composition and structure changed during forest conversion, whereas the bacterial community showed slight changes in unique taxa. Neither bacterial nor fungal community structures changed towards the similar pattern as native evergreen broad-leaved forest across 25 years. These results indicated that fungi were more susceptible to forest conversion than bacteria. Furthermore, compared with bacteria, fungi were more strongly affected by soil properties, such as NH4 +-N, pH, AK and TOC. Structural equation modeling indicated that fungi had strong impacts on C-, N- and P-cycling but that bacteria only affected C-cycling. Overall, the fungal community may play a more important role in the aboveground-belowground linkages and C-, N-, and P-cycling compared with the bacterial community during forest conversion. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aboveground vegetation; Bacteria and fungi; Forest conversion; Nutrient cycling; Selective logging","Wu, L.; School of Life Science, China; email: ncusk724@hotmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065058776

The region is also comprised of significant stands of Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL) that are in rapid decline. As part of a regional monitoring effort, we partnered with local government officials, conservation NGOs, and the timber company working in the region to assess ape abundances in relation to habitat characteristics and anthropogenic disturbances and compare IFL and non-IFL areas in the Sangha Trinational landscape, Republic of Congo. We found that chimpanzees and gorillas occur at high densities in IFL, as well as non-IFL. To better understand how selective logging changes floristic factors, we compared herb and tree densities from botanical surveys conducted in IFL and non-IFL. IFL had higher tree stem densities and less terrestrial herbs than logged habitats. However, few ape resources were logged in this extraction cycle and areas with tree stems removed subsequently had higher abundances of terrestrial herbs preferred by apes, which may contribute to the elevated ape abundance estimates. Floristic differences in logged forest were identified to coincide with differences in ape resource use. The chimpanzee tree nesting niche was reduced in non-IFL as night nests were constructed significantly closer to the ground than in IFL. Whereas, gorilla nest height locations did not differ significantly between IFL and non-IFL. To identify other potential anthropogenic impacts, we assessed direct and indirect impacts of road expansion and illegal hunting on wildlife in these remote areas. Increased access to IFL that facilitates illegal hunting raises concern for protecting wildlife across Western Equatorial Africa. We urge that the results of biodiversity assessments and strategic aspects of long-term protection should be taken into account when identifying conservation set-asides and maintaining diverse states of modified forests. Finally, the results of our monitoring efforts are provided as evidence of the value of long-term collaborations among local stakeholders, government officials, conservation agencies, and industrial partners to improve the implementation of certification standards and biodiversity conservation initiatives. © Copyright © 2019 Morgan, Strindberg, Winston, Stephens, Traub, Ayina, Ndolo Ebika, Mayoukou, Koni, Iyenguet and Sanz.","biodiversity; certification; chimpanzee; Congo Basin; gorilla","Morgan, D.; Lester E.

The necessary knowledge can be obtained by establishing large permanent sampling plots within which trees can be regularly measured. Such a monitoring experimental site exists in central Africa. It was settled in 1982 at M’Baïki, Central African Republic, and has provided reference standards to develop forest management and planning rules for many logging concessions in the region. Several projects have since established new monitoring experimental sites, focusing mainly on areas with different geological substrates. Two of these sites are located in managed logging concessions in the north of the Republic of Congo, on Cenozoic alluvia (Loundoungou) and on Mesozoic Carnot sandstone (Mokabi). Each site comprises two 400 ha blocks, each containing a trail of about 4,000 trees belonging to twenty commercial species and two 9 ha plots in which all trees more than 10 cm in diameter are measured. One block is logged after a few years of monitoring, with the second remaining as a control. Establishing a monitoring experimental site and making the first inventory required, on average, 34 months of work with a team of 8 people, at an average total cost of 94,500 €.

This paper examines how to more effectively integrate the complementary goals of conservation and restoration of tropical forests. Forest conservation and restoration interventions are integral components of a broad approach to forest ecosystem and landscape management that aims to maintain and restore key ecological processes and enhance human well-being, while minimizing biodiversity loss. The forest transition model provides a useful framework for understanding the relative importance of forest conservation and restoration interventions in different regions. Harmonizing conservation and restoration presents serious challenges for forest policy in tropical countries, particularly regarding the use and management of secondary forests, fallow vegetation, and forests degraded by logging and fire. Research to implement restoration more effectively in tropical regions can be stimulated by transforming questions that initially focused on conservation issues. Examination of papers published in Biotropica from 2000–2018 shows that most studies relevant to tropical forest conservation do not address forest restoration issues. Forest restoration studies, on the other hand, show a consistent association with conservation issues. There is much scope for further integration of conservation and restoration in research, practice, and policy. Securing a sustainable future for tropical forests requires developing and applying integrated approaches to landscape management that effectively combine knowledge and tools from multiple disciplines with practical experience and engagement of local stakeholders.

The stand density and felling intensity were analyzed to determine the factors affecting the amount of damage. Results indicated six types of damages: broken stem, crown injury, fallen or uprooted trees, leaning, bark and stem injuries, and buttress injury. All six types of damages were found in Central Kalimantan, whereas five types of damages (except buttress injury) were found in West Sumatra. On comparing pre- and post-logging conditions, a higher percentage of damage was identified in Central Kalimantan (27.8%) than in West Sumatra (22.4%). The percentage of tree damage increased in line with the increasing felling intensity at both locations.

However, these studies rely strongly on two major assumptions: (i) strong seedlings recruitment predispose for positive population dynamics, and (ii) more adult trees is a guarantee for a strong reproductive capability of the population. These assumptions are applied without accounting for the life history of the harvested species. Here, we revisit these assumptions in light of the life history theory, which predicts different responses of short- and long-lived species to perturbation. We predict that harvesting adults, rather than reducing seedling recruitment of long-lived species, would have greater impact on population dynamics. We tested our prediction on three mangrove species in South Africa. First, we reconstructed the projection matrices for three mangrove species in the Mngazana Estuary of Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Next, we simulated a range of harvest intensities for different life stages and explored how harvesting influences population dynamics. Finally, we examined the age-specific mortality trajectories for all three species. We found that populations of all three species were closer to their stable stage distribution. Contrary to popular belief, we found that changes in seedling recruitment will have minimal effects on mangrove long-term population dynamics, a finding consistent with the life history theory. However, contrary to expectation, simulating harvest of adults had minimal effect on population dynamics. This is due to low reproductive values for these late stages. Our analysis of age-specific mortality trajectories further provided evidence for positive senescence particularly for Avicennia which was the least resilient to harvest. Our findings cast doubt on the traditional forest management strategies that rely strongly on seedling density as a metric of sustainability and forbid unquestionably harvesting large individuals. We call for caution while generalizing forest management strategies irrespective of the life history of the species at hand. © 2019 The Author(s).

The logged forest plot was in an area where a selective logging operation had been conducted in 1958, whereas the primary forest plot has no trace of any major human-induced disturbances. The average canopy height in the logged forest plot increased from 23.6 m (2003) to 25.8 m (2011), but both of these heights were still significantly lower (P < 0.0001) than in those in the primary forest plot (28.7 m in 2003 and 30.4 m in 2011).

Decisions concerning the management of these production forests will be of major importance for Amazonian forests' fate. To date, no regional assessment of selective logging sustainability supports decision-making. Based on data from 3500 ha of forest inventory plots, our modelling results show that the average periodic harvests of 20 m3 ha-1 will not recover by the end of a standard 30 year cutting cycle. Timber recovery within a cutting cycle is enhanced by commercial acceptance of more species and with the adoption of longer cutting cycles and lower logging intensities. Recovery rates are faster in Western Amazonia than on the Guiana Shield. Our simulations suggest that regardless of cutting cycle duration and logging intensities, selectively logged forests are unlikely to meet timber demands over the long term as timber stocks are predicted to steadily decline. There is thus an urgent need to develop an integrated forest resource management policy that combines active management of production forests with the restoration of degraded and secondary forests for timber production. Without better management, reduced timber harvests and continued timber production declines are unavoidable. © 2019 The Author(s).

For example, in ~10,000 ha sampled in 48 forest management enterprises in Africa (Gabon, Republic of Congo, and the Democratic Republic of Congo), Indonesia, Suriname, and Mexico, an average of 69% (range 20–97%) of the area in logging blocks was not directly affected by timber harvests. The proportion of intact forest within logging blocks decreased very slightly with increases in harvest intensity in the accessed portion of the logging blocks (9–86 m3 ha−1) but decreased strongly with harvest intensity in entire logging blocks (0.3–48.2 m3 ha−1). More forest was left intact in areas farther from roads, on slopes &gt;40%, and within 25 m of perennial streams, but the effect sizes of each of these variables was small (~8%).

Subtropical forests have been heavily modified by humans and their response to climate change is poorly understood. We investigated the 9-year change observed in a mixed conifer-hardwood Atlantic forest mosaic that included both mature and selectively logged forest patches in subtropical South America. We used demographic monitoring data within 10 1 ha plots that were subjected to distinct management histories (plots logged until 1955, until 1987, and unlogged) to test the hypothesis that climate change affected forest structure and dynamics differentially depending on past disturbances. We determined the functional group of all species based on life-history affinities as well as many functional traits like leaf size, specific leaf area, wood density, total height, stem slenderness, and seed size data for the 66 most abundant species. Analysis of climate data revealed that minimum temperatures and rainfall have been increasing in the last few decades of the 20th century. Floristic composition differed mainly with logging history categories, with only minor change over the nine annual census intervals. Aboveground biomass increased in all plots, but increases were higher in mature unlogged forests, which showed signs of forest growth associated with increased CO2, temperature, and rainfall/treefall gap disturbance at the same time. Logged forests showed arrested succession as indicated by reduced abundances of Pioneers and biomass-accumulators like Large Seeded Pioneers and Araucaria, as well as reduced functional diversity. Management actions aimed at creating regeneration opportunities for long-lived pioneers are needed to restore community functional diversity, and ecosystem services such as increased aboveground biomass accumulation. We conclude that the effects of climate drivers on the dynamics of Brazilian mixed Atlantic forests vary with land-use legacies, and can differ importantly from the ones prevalent in better known tropical forests. © 2019 The Authors.

Location: Paragominas (Pará, Brazil), a municipality covering 19,395 km² in the north-eastern Amazon. Methods: We used Landsat annual imagery from 2000 to 2015 and spectral mixture analysis to derive time series of the fraction of soil (S), active photosynthetic vegetation (PV), and non-photosynthetic vegetation (senescent) (NPV) indicators. Results: The NPV values over a 16-year period revealed five different degradation trajectories (i.e., cumulative disturbances in space and over time): undisturbed forest, selectively logged forest (with a management plan), overlogged forest (no management plan), overlogged forest (charcoal production) and burned forest. The variance of NPV calculated per pixel over the same period is useful to map forest degradation over Paragominas municipality, highlighting the role of disturbance factors (logging, fuelwood gathering and fire).

These trees, however, are targeted for selective logging, reducing the intensity of fruit production and potentially affecting multiple trophic levels. Moreover, animal responses to resource pulse events have largely been studied in systems where the major mast consumers have been extirpated. We sought to evaluate the influence of human-induced habitat disturbance on animal responses to masting in a system where key mast consumers remain extant. We used motion-triggered camera traps to quantify terrestrial mammal and bird occurrences in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, relative to variation in fruit biomass from 69 plant families during a major (2014) and minor (2015) masting event and a non-mast year (2013), in both logged and unlogged forests. Bearded pigs (Sus barbatus) showed the clearest responses to masting and occurrence rates were highest in unlogged forest in the year following the major mast, suggesting that the pulse in fruit availability increased immigration or reproduction. We also detected local-scale spatial tracking of dipterocarp fruits in bearded pigs in unlogged forest, while this was equivocal in other species. In contrast, pigs and other vertebrate taxa in our study showed limited response to spatial or temporal variation in fruit availability in logged forest. Our findings suggest that vertebrates, namely bearded pigs, may respond to masting via movement and increased reproduction, but that these responses may be attenuated by habitat disturbance. © 2019 The Authors.

While this extensive land-use change has been shown to reduce species richness across landscapes, there is limited current knowledge on how deforestation affects the spatial arrangement of ecological communities. Identifying responses of beta-diversity to land-use change may reveal processes which could mitigate total biodiversity loss. We sampled weevils (superfamily: Curculionoidea) at multiple spatial scales across a land-use gradient at the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) Project in Sabah, Malaysia, in 2011–2012. We caught 160 taxa of weevil and calculated the response of alpha-diversity (1-ha scale) and beta-diversity (10-, 100-, and 1000-ha scales) to disturbance. Alpha-diversity of weevils was greatest in unlogged forest but landscape-level beta-diversity (100- and 1000-ha scale) was maintained across logged and unlogged due to high rates of spatial turnover. Turnover at smallest spatial scales (10-ha) in unlogged forest was highest in rough, flat terrain but smooth, sloping terrain had highest turnover in logged forest. Logging of flat terrain at small spatial scales has potential to decrease beta-diversity at greater scales. Beta-diversity at landscape-level in oil palm plantation remained high but was propagated by abundance shifts of few species instead of spatial turnover of many species. High temporal beta-diversity in unlogged forest was evident through periodic fluxes in abundance of many weevil species. We conclude that unlogged forest is irreplaceable for high beetle biodiversity but increased spatial turnover in some terrains may help conserve beetle communities in heavily-degraded landscapes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Beetles; Conservation; Logging; Oil palm plantations; Topography; Tropical forests","Sharp, A.C.; Department of Life Sciences, Silwood Park Campus, Buckhurst Road, United Kingdom; email: adam.sharp10@imperial.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063492259

All timber was extracted with a D6 track-type tractor. In total, four skid trails were evaluated, all logged in 1987 and two of them again in 1993. Systematic sampling was applied to the four trails and two controls. The data collected were rut depth, soil bulk density (BD), soil penetration resistance (PR) and seedling and sapling density. Soil physical properties were determined in three layers from 0 to 15 cm in depth, and seedling density was determined from 36 plots of 4m² in size at the soil sample locations. Rut depths were significantly different (p < 0.05) between years, with the greatest depth of 32 cm recorded for the soil in 1993. The results for BD and PR differed from each other only slightly. In the 0–5 cm depth between the ruts both BD and PR were still significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the control for both years, but within the ruts there were no significant differences between the controls of either year. However, in the 5–15 cm depth within the ruts, BD was always significantly higher (p < 0.001) than the control for both years, as well as was PR for the depths 5–10 cm (p < 0.05) and 10–15 (p < 0.001) within the ruts for both years. The soil layers between the ruts in the depth of 10–15 cm for 1993 were significantly different (p < 0.05) for BD and PR, but the means for this same depth were not root limiting for plants for either BD or PR. The evaluation of seedling and sapling density revealed significant differences for the class of saplings greater than 150 cm. Both the 1987 and the 1993 plots had significantly lower numbers per m², 1987 (p < 0.01) and 1993 (p < 0.001), than the control. There were more saplings located between the ruts than in the ruts for both years, but this was not statistically significant. The conclusion of this study is that partial recovery of the disturbed soil had occurred after 24 and 30 years, with the soil surface horizon within the ruts no different than the undisturbed soil of the control.

Although these impacts are well documented, what is little known is the extent to which selective logging affects tree floristic composition and its recovery process. Understanding how floristic composition is affected by logging activities is essential for determining subsequent cutting cycles, for the maintenance of carbon stocks and for biodiversity conservation. This research investigates the effect of logging on long-term trends on the recovery of species composition in a tropical forest using a unique logging experiment where measurements have been taken annually over a period of 25 years. Changes in 12 long-term 1-hectare (ha) permanent plots were assessed where different selective logging intensities occurred. In the first years after logging, floristic composition differed widely between intact and selectively logged forests, with exploited areas deviating from pre-logged composition. Over time, exploited areas shifted towards the original composition, with more pronounced changes in this trend after ∼13 years. Shifts in floristic composition were caused mainly by a significant increase in light-demanding fast-growing pioneer species and their subsequent continuous high mortality rates after 13 years of the recovery process. In contrast, the control plots showed similar shifts in composition over time, suggesting external factors such as long-term climate changes may be driving these shifts. The results suggest that 25 years after an experimental selective logging has taken place, floristic composition tends to recover closer to the pre-logged status. Thus, in the absence of further human disturbances, experimental selectively logged forests in low to moderate intensities are compatible with biodiversity conservation, at least during the first cycle of exploitation. Reconciling conservation strategies with the recovery of stocks of commercial timber species would be greatly improved by using these results and lead towards more sustainable forest management plans. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamics; Floristic change; Forest management; Long-term; Permanent plot; Tropical forest","Gaui, T.D.; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia – INPA, Av.

However, this figure does not include other, more cryptic but pervasive forms of degradation, such as overhunting. Here, we quantified and mapped the spatial patterns of mammal defaunation in the tropics using a database of 3,281 mammal abundance declines from local hunting studies. We simultaneously accounted for population abundance declines and the probability of local extirpation of a population as a function of several predictors related to human accessibility to remote areas and species’ vulnerability to hunting. We estimated an average abundance decline of 13% across all tropical mammal species, with medium-sized species being reduced by &gt;27% and large mammals by &gt;40%. Mammal populations are predicted to be partially defaunated (i.e., declines of 10%–100%) in ca. 50% of the pantropical forest area (14 million km2), with large declines (&gt;70%) in West Africa. According to our projections, 52% of the intact forests (IFs) and 62% of the wilderness areas (WAs) are partially devoid of large mammals, and hunting may affect mammal populations in 20% of protected areas (PAs) in the tropics, particularly in West and Central Africa and Southeast Asia. The pervasive effects of overhunting on tropical mammal populations may have profound ramifications for ecosystem functioning and the livelihoods of wild-meat-dependent communities, and underscore that forest coverage alone is not necessarily indicative of ecosystem intactness.

However, little is known about the extent of road edge effects or their influence on the movements of tropical understory animal species. Here, we used forest rats to address the following questions: (a) Does the occupancy of rats differ from road edges to forest interior within logged forests? (b) Do roads inhibit the movements of rats within these forests? We established trapping grids along a road edge-to-forest interior gradient at four roads and in three control sites within a logged forest in Sabah, Malaysia. To quantify the probability of road crossing, rats were captured, translocated across a road, and then recaptured on subsequent nights. We caught 216 individuals of eight species on 3,024 trap nights. Rat occupancy did not differ across the gradient from road edge to interior, and 48 percent of the 105 translocated individuals crossed the roads and were recaptured. This proportion was not significantly different from that of rats returning in control sites (38% of 60 individuals), suggesting that small roads were not barriers to rat movements within logged forests. Subadults were significantly more likely to return from translocation than adults in both road and control sites. Our results are encouraging for the ecology of small mammal communities in heavily logged forests, because small logging roads do not restrict the movements of rats and therefore are unlikely to create an edge effect or influence habitat selection. © 2019 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","barrier effects; capture–recapture: dispersal; linear openings; Malaysia; small mammals; tropical deforestation","Heon, S.P.; Department of Life Sciences, United Kingdom; email: suipeng.heon@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063586225

Liana cutting is an often-prescribed but seldom applied silvicultural treatment designed to foster the growth of future crop trees (hereafter: FCTs). Small-scale studies indicate that this treatment is effective, but little is known about its efficiency (i.e., proportions of lianas missed) or financial cost effectiveness at operational scales. To fill these gaps, we worked in a commercial forest concession in Belize where FCTs and trees to be felled were liberated from lianas in 500–1000 ha annual timber harvest blocks. We found that field crews assigned this and inventory-related tasks spent 11.8% of their time cutting lianas from FCTs at a cost of $0.11 per tree. Workers failed to cut 31.9% of the lianas that infested the 701 FCTs they were supposed to liberate; most of the missed lianas grew into the FCT crowns from neighbors or hung down far from the bole [an additional 48 FCTs (6%) were completely missed]. In a logging block treated 9-years prior to this study, 39% of the liberated Swietenia macrophylla FCTs 29–56 cm DBH were still liana-free whereas in an untreated stand, 94% of similar-sized conspecific control FCTs were liana-infested. Based on tree ring data for the same 9-year period, the liberated FCTs grew 38–63% faster than control FCTs. If the mean growth benefit is sustained over the entire 40-year cutting cycle, each liberated FCT will yield an average of 1.51 m 3 (639 board feet) more roundwood than comparable FCTs in unliberated forest. Over this 40-year period with an annual discount rate of 4.5%, this added volume gives the $0.11 investment per tree a net present value of US $161.38 and a profitability index of 1467 for export quality timber.

Each implementation level reduces logging emissions by a consistent proportion below the business-as-usual emissions baseline, which varies with harvest intensity. Level 1 reflects the best recorded emissions performance for each type of practice. Level 2 is more ambitious but feasible based on workshop feedback from concession managers and forestry experts, and confirmed by a recent demonstration. At Level 1 emissions can be reduced by 33%, avoiding emissions of 64.9 ± 22.2 MgCO 2 per ha harvested, on average. At Level 2 emissions can be reduced by 46%, avoiding 88.6 ± 22.7 MgCO 2 ha −1 . The greatest emissions reductions derive from (i) not felling trees that will be left in the forest due to commercial defects, and (ii) use of long-line cable winching to avoid bulldozer impacts. We also quantify the potential to avoid logging steep slopes and riparian habitats, while holding to our RIL-C accounting assumption that timber yields are maintained to avoid problems of leakage and product substitution. Logging damage to riparian areas &lt;50 m from perennial streams could be avoided by re-locating harvests to less sensitive areas that currently are not accessed due to lack of spatial planning. In all but the steepest concessions, all slopes &gt;40% could similarly be avoided. The combined areas of these sensitive habitats (steep slopes and riparian buffers) represented 16% of each cutting block on average. Implementation of RIL-C practices would deliver 8% (Level 1) and 11% (Level 2) of Indonesia's pledged reductions to their forest reference emissions level as a nationally determined contribution to the Paris Climate Agreement. In concert with RIL-C practices, 30% of logging concession areas could be permanently protected from logging and conversion to minimize impacts on biodiversity, soils, and water quality, thereby expanding Indonesia's protected areas by one third and achieving 93% of Indonesia's Aichi Target 11 (the effective conservation of at least 17% of lands).

Tree mortality accounts for almost 30% of the biomass and plays a negligible role in biomass accumulation estimates. Mortality rate is highly dependent on tree size.

Therefore, tropical forests are susceptible to logging operations and need careful forest management. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon sink; Dynamic plot; Inventory; Logging; Tropical secondary forest management","Tan, Z.; Institute of Tropical Agriculture and Forestry, China; email: tanzh@xtbg.ac.cn",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045069199

Left alone, these ecosystems have been expected to undergo natural regeneration and succession towards old growth forests, but extreme drought events may challenge this process. While old growth forests possess a certain level of resilience, we lack understanding as to how logging may affect forest responses to drought. This study examines the drought-logging interaction in seedling dynamics within a landscape of logged and unlogged forests in Sabah Malaysia, based on 73 plots monitored before and after the 2015-16 El Niño drought. Drought increased seedling mortality in all forests, but the magnitude of this impact was modulated by logging intensity, with forests with lower canopy leaf area index and above-ground biomass experiencing greater drought induced mortality. Moreover, community traits in more heavily logged forests shifted towards being more ruderal after drought, suggesting that the trajectory of forest succession had been reversed. These results indicate that with reoccurring strong droughts under a changing climate, logged forests that have had over half of their biomass removed may suffer permanently arrested succession. Targeted management interventions may therefore be necessary to lift the vulnerable forests above the biomass threshold. © 2019 The Author(s).

However, the Landsat spatial resolution (30 m) has often been considered too coarse for reliably mapping small-scale selective logging. Imagery from the recently launched Sentinel-2 sensor, with a resampled 10 m spatial resolution, may improve the detection of forest disturbances. This study compared the performance of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data for the detection of selective logging in an area located in the Brazilian Amazon. Logging impacts in seven areas, which had governmental authorization for harvesting timber, were mapped by calculating the difference of a self-referenced normalized burn ratio (ΔrNBR) index over corresponding time periods (2016-2017) for imagery of both satellite sensors. A robust reference dataset was built using both high- and very-high-resolution imagery. It was used to define optimum ΔrNBR thresholds for forest disturbance maps, via a bootstrapping procedure, and for estimating accuracies and areas. A further assessment of our approach was also performed in three unlogged areas. Additionally, field data regarding logging infrastructure were collected in the seven study sites where logging occurred. Both satellites showed the same performance in terms of accuracy, with area-adjusted overall accuracies of 96.7% and 95.7% for Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8, respectively. However, Landsat 8 mapped 36.9% more area of selective logging compared to Sentinel-2 data. Logging infrastructure was better detected from Sentinel-2 (43.2%) than Landsat 8 (35.5%) data, confirming its potential for mapping small-scale logging. We assessed the impacted area by selective logging with a regular 300 m × 300 m grid over the pixel-based results, leading to 1143 ha and 1197 ha of disturbed forest on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data, respectively. No substantial differences in terms of accuracy were found by adding three unlogged areas to the original seven study sites. © 2019 by the authors.","Amazonas; Brazil; Forest cover change; Forest degradation; Forest disturbance; Forest management; Landsat 8; PlanetScope; Sentinel-2; Tropical forests","Lima, T.A.; Department of Forest Resources Management, 2424 Main Mall, Canada; email: tha.almeida.lima@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065013917

However, automated approaches using very high resolution (VHR) satellite data (≤ 1 m spatial resolution) to accurately track these small-scale human disturbances over large and remote areas are not readily available. The main constraint for performing this type of analysis is the lack of spatially accurate tree-scale validation data. In this study, we assessed the potential of VHR satellite imagery to detect canopy tree loss related to selective logging in closed-canopy tropical forests. To do this, we compared the tree loss detection capability of WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1 satellites with airborne LiDAR, which acquired pre- and post-logging data at the Jamari National Forest in the Brazilian Amazon. We found that logging drove changes in canopy height ranging from -5.6 to -42.2 m, with a mean reduction of -23.5 m. A simple LiDAR height difference threshold of -10 m was enough to map 97% of the logged trees. Compared to LiDAR, tree losses can be detected using VHR satellite imagery and a random forest (RF) model with an average precision of 64%, while mapping 60% of the total tree loss. Tree losses associated with large gap openings or tall trees were more successfully detected. In general, the most important remote sensing metrics for the RF model were standard deviation statistics, especially those extracted from the reflectance of the visible bands (R, G, B), and the shadow fraction. While most small canopy gaps closed within ∼2 years, larger gaps could still be observed over a longer time. Nevertheless, the use of annual imagery is advised to reach acceptable detectability. Our study shows that VHR satellite imagery has the potential for monitoring the logging in tropical forests and detecting hotspots of natural disturbance with a low cost at the regional scale. © 2019 by the authors.","Amazon; Disturbance monitoring; Forest dynamics; Forest management; GeoEye-1; Jamari national forest; Multi-temporal analysis; Random forest; Remote sensing; WorldView-2","Dalagnol, R.; Remote Sensing Division, São José dos Campos, Brazil; email: ricds@hotmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063993683

Understanding how sun bears utilise habitat in more degraded landscapes is increasingly important for the effective conservation of the species. We studied how landscape and plot attributes affect sun bear habitat use along a gradient of logging disturbance in a lowland forest site of Sumatra. We conducted surveys of bear claw marks to indicate sun bear habitat use at plot and landscape scales, and inform forest restoration strategies that benefit the conservation management of the species. We recorded 12 habitat features and the presence/absence of claw marks in 262 plots in four different habitat types. We reduced the number of habitat variables using Principal Components Analysis (PCA), resulting in four derived habitat factors. We used these factors in a Discriminant Analysis to refine habitat classifications of plots, and modelled presence/absence of claw marks using the PCA factors in a binary logistic regression. We inventoried tree species in a subset of randomly selected plots with claw marks alongside paired control plots with no claw marks. We compared tree community compositions in these plots using ANOSIM and SIMPER analyses. Based on claw mark signs, sun bear habitat use appeared to be non-random and was significantly associated with gradients of increasing habitat intactness, from non-forest habitat to least disturbed forest. Two PCA factors explained the probability of bears utilising a given habitat, which increased with tree biomass and decreased with understorey cover. At the plot level, tree family and species compositions were significantly different between plots without and with claw marks. The abundance and use of Olacaceae stems was significantly higher in plots with claw marks. Incorporating forest restoration strategies that enhance or increase more intact forest and the availability of key tree resources should benefit the conservation of sun bears and encourage natural forest regeneration in these degraded landscapes. We also emphasise the conservation value of degraded forest habitats for this species while ensuring bear movement and connectivity within modified landscape matrices. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Conservation ecology; Forest structure; Sun bear; Tree community composition; Tropical forest restoration","Lee, D.C.; School of Applied Sciences, United Kingdom; email: david.lee@southwales.ac.uk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062428498

Current assessment protocols recommended in the published literature focus on sample-based estimation of area and accuracy of features in remote sensing-based maps, which is less relevant for assessing the performance of near real-time monitoring systems. Rather than area bias and accuracy of mapped features, the objective of near real-time monitoring is fast detection of forest disturbance events. Here we present a new assessment framework as well as two new algorithms for near real-time monitoring of tropical forest disturbance. The first algorithm (NRT-CCDC) fits time series models based on MODIS data to predict future observations. Detections of forest disturbance are labeled as “low-probability”, “high-probability”, and “confirmed” based on the number of consecutive observations that deviate substantially from the prediction. The second algorithm (Fusion2) predicts MODIS observations at a high temporal frequency by building a model based on a time series of Landsat observations. Fusion2 utilizes daily MODIS observations from both Terra and Aqua to achieve rapid detection of disturbance events. A framework for assessing the performance of near real-time monitoring is presented that focuses on the timing and minimum detectable size of forest disturbance events while still being based on probability sampling and design-based inference. Central to the framework is a new metric we refer to as the “alert-lag relationship”, which characterizes the frequency of omitted disturbance events as a function of the time lag between the dates of disturbance and detection. When applied to three different near-real monitoring systems representing three levels of operational readiness (Fusion2, NRT-CCDC and Terra-i), we found that Fusion2 achieved an alert accuracy (event-based agreement) of 50% after 82 days and NRT-CCDC achieved 50% after 126 days. Terra-i never achieved an alert accuracy of 50% but achieved 30% after 109 days. In terms of event size, all three systems showed better performance in detecting large events compared to small events. The smallest event detected by the three systems was 6.5 ha. Conventional accuracy assessment (pixel-based agreement) showed that the user's accuracy, which characterizes commission errors, of the disturbance class for Fusion2, NRT-CCDC, and Terra-i were 87%, 79%, and 30% respectively. The two more complex systems, Fusion2 and NRT-CCDC were consistently more accurate than the operational Terra-i system. In general, the higher the cost of implementing the system corresponded to a higher accuracy of the detection system. A primary objective moving forward is to make the NRT-CCDC and Fusion2 more operational over larger areas. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Accuracy assessment; CCDC; Deforestation; Fusion; Landsat; MODIS; Near real-time; Time series","Tang, X.; Department of Earth & Environment, 685 Commonwealth Avenue, United States; email: xjtang@bu.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061551373

To assess variation in logging-induced emissions and to estimate potential reductions in those emissions, we estimated carbon impacts from damage to trees &gt; 5 cm DBH in the annual cutting areas of ten forest-managing ejidos. Baselines were developed for emissions from felling, skidding and transport of timber and then ejidos were compared with respect to whether they were Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified, size of annual cutting area, logging intensity, and implementation of RIL practices, particularly directional felling, skid trail planning, and the use of small modified agricultural tractors instead of large forestry skidders. The carbon impacts of enrichment planting in multiple-tree felling gaps (400–1800 m 2 ) were also evaluated. Carbon emissions from selective logging averaged 1.52 Mg m −3 but ranged 1.19–2.55 Mg m −3 among the 10 ejidos. Most emissions were from the remnants of trees felled for their timber (73%), followed by skidding (11%), transport infrastructure (i.e. logging roads and landings; 8%), and collateral damage from felling (7%). Our analyses indicate that FSC certification was not associated with any difference in carbon emissions from selective logging but that employment of RIL practices resulted in fewer damaged trees and lower carbon emissions even in ejidos with high logging intensities. Use of modified agricultural tractors for log yarding (i.e., skidding) reduced C emissions by 0.15 Mg m −3 or 5 Mg km −1 of skid trail. Greater collateral damage was found in multiple felling gaps but the increased emissions were offset by reductions in the remnants of harvest trees. Adoption of RIL-C practices by all community forestry ejidos in the region would contribute substantially to the Mexican forest sector's efforts to mitigate climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; Logging damage; Selective logging; Tropical forest","Ellis, E.A.; Centro de Investigaciones Tropicales, Xalapa, Mexico; email: eellis@uv.mx",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061086636

However, there is limited empirical evidence of its effects on forest demographic rates in Southeast Asia. We used 22 four-hectare plots in the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment (a reduced impact logging site) enrichment line planted with 16 dipterocarp species to assess the effects of complete liana cutting on tree growth and survival. We compared plots where lianas were only cut along planting lines (standard enrichment line planting) with those with one (2014) or two rounds (2011 and 2014) of complete liana cutting. We found increased seedling growth following the first complete liana cut in 2011 relative to the enrichment line planting, consistent with previous studies. The response after 3 years to the cutting in 2014 depended on whether lianas had been previously cut or not: in twice-cut plots, seedling growth was not significantly different from the standard enrichment planting controls, whereas growth in plots with only one complete cut in 2014 was significantly slower. Seedling survival decreased through time for both once- and twice-cut liana treatments but remained stable in controls. Sapling growth after the 2014 liana cutting showed a similar pattern to seedling growth, while tree growth following the 2014 liana cutting was significantly lower than controls regardless of whether lianas were cut twice (2011 and 2014) or once (2014). Differences in response between the two rounds of liana cutting were likely due to changes in precipitation—2011 was followed by consistent rainfall while 2014 was followed by two severe droughts within 2 years. Synthesis and applications. Our results generally support the widely reported positive effects of liana cutting on tree growth and survival. However, reduced growth and survival after the 2015/2016 El Niño suggests that drought may temporarily undermine the benefits of liana cutting in logged tropical forests. Managers of similar areas in SE Asia should consider halting liana cutting during El Niño events. In other tropical areas, seedling survival should be monitored to assess to what extent results from SE Asia are transferable. © 2019 The Authors Journal of Applied Ecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ecological Society.","climate change; forest conservation; forest restoration; liana; logged forest; plant–climate interactions; tree demography; tropical forest","O'Brien, M.J.; Institute of Integrative Biology, Switzerland; email: mikey.j.obrien@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061064079

We modeled the relationships between emissions and biophysical conditions, logging practices, and forest policies and then used these models to estimate potential emission reductions from full implementation of RIL-C practices. We applied the method in 8 forest management enterprises (FMEs; i.e., concessions) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 9 in Gabon, and 6 in the Republic of Congo (RoC). Committed logging emissions expressed per cubic meter of timber harvested (to control for differences in logging intensities) ranged from 0.63 Mg C m −3 in a FME in RoC to 4.8 Mg C m −3 in a FME in Gabon, with an overall average of 2.1 Mg C m −3 . Logging emissions were dominated by damage caused by road and log landing construction (i.e., hauling; 50%) and felling (43%; includes carbon in extracted logs). Total emissions represented only about 9% of unlogged forest biomass carbon stocks. Average emissions were highest in Gabon (2.65 Mg C m −3 ) followed by DRC (1.84 Mg C m −3 ) and RoC (1.54 Mg C m −3 ). Emissions from concessions certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC, N = 6) and those that were not certified (N = 17) did not differ. Nearly half (51%) of logging emissions could be avoided without reducing timber yields if all best examples of RIL-C logging practices observed were applied in the same FME. At the country level, if all FMEs were to utilize these practices, emissions reductions would be 34% in RoC, 45% in DRC, and 62% in Gabon. When combined with country-level logging statistics, emissions from selective logging as currently practiced in the six countries of the Congo Basin are equivalent to 40% of the region's total emissions from deforestation. © 2019","Climate change mitigation; REDD+; Tropical forestry; Tropical silviculture","Umunay, P.M.; The School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, United States; email: peter.umunay@yale.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061037498

Realistic forest-dynamics models for this biome are largely lacking. Using linear mixed models, we analyse basal area development for the commercially valuable tree species of dipterocarps and the fast-growing pioneer Macaranga spp., following two selective logging methods; supervised logging (SL) and conventional logging (CL) combined with- or without pre-harvest climber cutting (SLC and SL, and CLC and CL, respectively). After logging there was an initial period of about five years before recovery started. During the 18-year study period, the average stand basal area growth rates of the dipterocarp group in the SLC treatment was double that in the CL treatment, revealing a faster recovery. Eighteen years after logging, SL and SLC treatments recovered 93% and 84%, respectively, of the initial standing dipterocarp basal area, compared to 73% and 72% recovery for the CL and CLC treatments. SLC treatments reduced the overall establishment of pioneer species (Macaranga spp.) by about 45% in contrast to CL and CLC treatments.

Several factors are known to affect tropical tree demographic processes, like tree growth, survival and recruitment. Tree growth has particularly been showed to depend on ecological conditions, tree genetics, and competition with surrounding vegetation, as well as tree size or ontogeny. Yet, due to the paucity of available data, the importance of such factors is unclear and usually ignored when estimating future timber yields. To fill this gap, we chose to evaluate the variability in growth of one African long-lived pioneer and commercially very important species: Triplochiton scleroxylon K. Schum, gathering a broad dataset composed of tree ring data recorded in one site in Cameroon and periodic field inventory data recorded in seven sites across central Africa. In total, we analyzed 13,225 records of annual tree diameter increments recorded over 920 trees from seven sites in Cameroon, Republic of the Congo and Central African Republic. We evaluated (i) to what extent the average growth of trees that reach harvestable dimensions differs from population average and (ii) to what extent past perturbations influence the growth of remaining trees. We found the diameter growth of T. scleroxylon to be remarkably variable and this study provided an unprecedented quantification of the magnitude of some key growth determinants. In unlogged forests, the diameter increment of T. scleroxylon ranged between 0.40 cm year −1 in Southern Cameroon and 0.83 cm year −1 in South-Eastern Cameroon. The diameter increment was weakly related to tree size but increased twofold from unlogged to logged forests. Perturbation caused by logging stimulates growth of T. scleroxylon for at least 10–15 years. Finally, harvestable timber stock of large-sized T. scleroxylon was found to be constituted by trees that grew in average twice faster than trees of the entire extant population. As more and more inventory data become available, quantifying these effects could be replicated for other timber species and in other sites, to improve the accuracy of future timber resource estimates and improve forest management guidelines. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ayous; Juvenile selection effect; Light-demanding species; Logging; Obeche; Persistent fast growth; Stock recovery rate; Tree-ring analysis","Ligot, G.; Université de Liège – Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, Passage des Déportés 2, 5030 Gembloux, Belgium; email: gligot@uliege.be",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060866893

Having a timely and accurate understanding of global LSLA pattern will be critically important for concluding related policies and actions. Here, we investigate global LSLA networks and find that land acquisitions are characterized by dominant acquisition flows from the developing to the developed world (75.4%), and less of these flows are retained within the developing world (22.8%) or the developed world (1.8%). Policy-driven moratoria on existing LSLA are a key mechanism used to minimize global forest loss and recently employed in Indonesia, however their effectiveness remains unclear given a lack of quantitative synthesis. Based on a spatially-explicit temporal analysis of forest loss from 2001-2017, we find that, as a whole of Indonesia, the increased forest loss rate of 0.091 Mha yr-1 (2001-2011) slowed down to 0.001 Mha yr-1 (2012-2017) after moratoria established in 2011. Meanwhile, based on a comparison of annual forest loss in logging, timber, and oil palm concessions, we find that land concessions outside the moratorium experienced 35%-396% higher rates of forest loss than in comparable land concessions within the moratorium. Decreased forest loss from full implementation of moratoria on all land concessions could mitigate a maximum aboveground biomass carbon emission of 112 888 ± 24 766 Mg C yr-1, which is a nearly 41.89% reduction relative to the counterfactual scenario of no moratorium. These findings lend support for international cooperation and collective action to put into practice effective land moratoria to reverse decade-long trajectories of tropical forest loss. © 2019 The Author(s).

With increasing pressure of degradation and deforestation, these forests have been prioritized for conservation and carbon offset through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanisms. We provide the first regional assessment of forest structure and aboveground biomass using measurements from a combination of ground tree inventories and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar). More than 80,000 ha of lidar samples were collected based on a stratified random sampling to provide a regionally unbiased quantification of forest structure of Chocó across gradients of vegetation structure, disturbance and elevation. We developed a model to convert measurements of vertical structure of forests into aboveground biomass (AGB) for terra firme, wetlands, and mangrove forests. We used the Random Forest machine learning model and a formal uncertainty analysis to map forest height and AGB at 1-ha spatial resolution for the entire pacific coastal region using spaceborne data, extending from the coast to higher elevation of Andean forests. Results: Upland Chocó forests have a mean canopy height of 21.8 m and AGB of 233.0 Mg/ha, while wetland forests are characterized by a lower height and AGB (13.5 m and 117.5 Mg/a). Mangroves have a lower mean height than upland forests (16.5 m), but have a similar AGB as upland forests (229.9 Mg/ha) due to their high wood density. Within the terra firme forest class, intact forests have the highest AGB (244.3 ± 34.8 Mg/ha) followed by degraded and secondary forests with 212.57 ± 62.40 Mg/ha of biomass. Forest degradation varies in biomass loss from small-scale selective logging and firewood harvesting to large-scale tree removals for gold mining, settlements, and illegal logging. Our findings suggest that the forest degradation has already caused the loss of more than 115 million tons of dry biomass, or 58 million tons of carbon. Conclusions: Our assessment of carbon stocks and forest degradation can be used as a reference for reporting on the state of the Chocó forests to REDD+ projects and to encourage restoration efforts through conservation and climate mitigation policies. © 2019 The Author(s).","Biomass; Forest degradation; Forest height; Lidar; Random forest; REDD+; Remote sensing; Tropical forest; Wood density","Meyer, V.; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, United States; email: victoria.meyer@jpl.nasa.gov",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063401822

In particular, selective logging is a form of forest degradation that alters canopy structure and function, with persistent ecological impacts following forest harvest. In this study, we employed airborne laser scanning in 2012 and 2014 to estimate three-dimensional changes in the forest canopy and understory structure and aboveground biomass following reduced-impact selective logging in a site in Eastern Amazon. Also, we developed a binary classification model to distinguish intact versus logged forests. We found that canopy gap frequency was significantly higher in logged versus intact forests even after 8 years (the time span of our study). In contrast, the understory of logged areas could not be distinguished from the understory of intact forests after 6–7 years of logging activities. Measuring new gap formation between LiDAR acquisitions in 2012 and 2014, we showed rates 2 to 7 times higher in logged areas compared to intact forests. New gaps were spatially clumped with 76 to 89% of new gaps within 5 m of prior logging damage. The biomass dynamics in areas logged between the two LiDAR acquisitions was clearly detected with an average estimated loss of −4.14 ± 0.76 MgC ha−1 y−1. In areas recovering from logging prior to the first acquisition, we estimated biomass gains close to zero. Together, our findings unravel the magnitude and duration of delayed impacts of selective logging in forest structural attributes, confirm the high potential of airborne LiDAR multitemporal data to characterize forest degradation in the tropics, and present a novel approach to forest classification using LiDAR data. © 2019 by the authors.

Rural tropical forest resource owners (FROs) often have limited economic resources and resource rents from timber harvests can help them access goods and services that they otherwise cannot afford. This paper uses historical log export data and timber royalty rates to compare the timber resource rents received by FROs in PNG to log export duties and levies collected by the PNG government and the residual cash flows collected by logging companies from log exports. Between 2007 and 2017, PNG's FROs received an annual average of 6.1% of the market value of the logs harvested. By comparison, the PNG government received an annual average of 42.3% from duties and levies and the logging industry received 51.6% for its costs/profits. We also found that the real value of royalties for different timber species has declined by between 32% and 66% since 1991 due to the use of the fixed-rate system. We recommend that future royalty payments in PNG be calculated as a percentage of market value and that there be greater public participation in the determination of the appropriate income split to provide a more equitable distribution of timber harvest revenues between different actors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Fair market value; Forest policy; Log exports; Native forest harvesting; Stumpage prices","Scudder, M.G.; Tropical Forests and People Research Centre, Locked Bag 4, Australia; email: mscudder@usc.edu.au",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058023479

Logged plots had greater values for traits that drive carbon capture and growth, whilst old-growth forests had greater values for structural and persistence traits. Although disturbance was the primary driver of trait expression, soil nutrients explained a statistically independent axis of variation linked to leaf size and nutrient concentration. Soil characteristics influenced trait expression via nutrient availability, nutrient pools, and pH. Our finding, that traits have dissimilar responses to land use and soil resource availability, provides robust evidence for the need to consider the abiotic context of logging when predicting plant functional diversity across human-modified tropical forests.

The increase of human activities on these forests, among which logging, makes the conservation of biodiversity and associated services strongly dependent on the sustainability of these activities. However the indicators commonly used to assess the impact of forest exploitation, namely species richness and biomass, provide a limited understanding of their sustainability. Here, we assessed the sustainability of common forest exploitation in the Guiana Shield studying the recovery of two ecosystem services i.e. carbon storage and wood stock, and an ecosystem function i.e. seed dispersal by animals. Specifically, we compared total and commercial biomass, as well as functional composition in seed size of animal-dispersed species in replicated forest plots before and 27 years after exploitation. Species richness is also studied to allow comparison. While species richness was not affected by forest exploitation, total and commercial biomass as well as seed size of animal-dispersed species decreased 27 years after exploitation, similarly to forests affected by hunting. These results show that ecosystem services and function likely did not recover even at the lowest intensity of forest exploitation studied, questioning the sustainability of the most common rotation-cycle duration applied in the tropics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropogenic pressure; Carbon storage; Commercial stock; Functional composition; Humid tropical forest; Seed dispersal; Selective logging; Sustainability","Yguel, B.; Centre d'Ecologie et des Sciences de la Conservation (CESCO), CP 135, 57 rue Cuvier, France; email: benyguel@hotmail.fr",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057157005

In addition, these effects are often paralleled with shifts in soil fungal community composition and functional guilds with potential feedbacks on ecosystem functioning. Clarifying how soil fungal communities are linked to the effects of historical logging could help us better understand the ecological consequences of logging. Here, we collected soils from 61 25 m × 25 m quadrats across a 160-km2 tropical rainforest in Hainan Island, China, which had been partially clear cut or selectively harvested and left to recover for up to 50 years. Soil fungal community composition and species co-variation networks were investigated in the selectively harvested (select cut) and clear cut forest stands and were compared to data from the primary stands without a history of logging. Historical logging shifted fungal community composition from Zygomycota towards Basidiomycota domination mainly through modifying vegetation composition and soil properties. The relative abundance of root associated fungi (i.e., ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal), animal pathogens and wood saprotrophs increased 50 years after logging, while the relative abundance of undefined saprotrophs decreased. In select cut stands, the fungal community was better organized with higher numbers of functionally interrelated operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and more generalist OTUs. In contrast, the number of functionally interrelated OTUs was lowest in the fungal network in clear cut stands. By comparing the topological roles of the shared OTUs among the three types of forest stands, we found role-shifts among fungal members from the specialists in the primary stands to the generalists in the select cut stands. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the major phyla involved in the role-shifts. Moreover, the fungal network in primary stands was positively associated with litter nutrients, while that in select cut stands was positively related to soil nutrients content. This indicated that the major drivers of fungal community organization shifted from litter nutrients content in the primary forest towards soil nutrients content in the selectively harvested forest. In the clear cut stands, however, the associations between fungal network and both litter and soil nutrients content decreased when compared with those in the primary and select cut stands. More than 60% of the total links among fungal members in clear cut stands were negative, implying a trend of niche partitioning among fungal groups with a half-century recovery after clearcutting in the tropical rainforest. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Forest management; Fungal guild; Microbial network; Soil fungi; Tropical rainforest","Xu, H.; Research Institute of Tropical Forestry, Longdong, China; email: hanxu81@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056461085

To determine the successional stages - and recovery pathways - for mixed dipterocarp forest in Dong Nai Biosphere Reserve (DNBR), Southern Vietnam, we used a dataset of 61 pairs of 1000 m2 plots, representing a range of recovery times (21–38 years), disturbances, and soil types with five categories: (1) Agent Orange affected + Logging (AO + Logging), (2) Logging, (3) Logging + Inundated, (4) Assisted Natural Regeneration + Logging (ANR + Logging) and (5) Protection. We first grouped recovered forest stands based on structure, composition, and dominant species. Each group was then identified by the dominant species types (bamboo, deciduous or evergreen) and indicator species. The forest stand characteristics, including species composition, basal area, tree size distribution, and species biodiversity were assessed for correlation with three site factors: soil type, disturbance type, and recovery time. Our results show that after 27 years recovery, logged mixed dipterocarp forest in DNBR can recover back to evergreen mixed dipterocarp forest, or change to bamboo or deciduous forests. The change in forest community depended on soil characteristics, especially soil water conditions, which are strongly correlated with topography. In addition, the recovered forest structures varied according to disturbance type and recovery time. By determining recovery stage, and the major drivers of the recovery process, site-specific ecological restoration techniques for seasonal tropical forest management can be suggested. Most recovered forest in DNBR is in a late or intermediate stage of vegetation development. However, retrogression and recovery deceleration were associated with invaders, such as grasses, climbers and bamboos, suggesting that their control is necessary in order to accelerate the natural development of native vegetation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,"Do, H.T.T.; Forest Research Centre, PO Box 157, Australia; email: t.do.16@student.scu.edu.au",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056224846

Hunting-induced declines in populations of seed-dispersing animals are expected to reduce dispersal of the tree species that rely on them, resulting in potentially greater distance- and density-dependent mortality. At the same time, selective logging may alter competitive interactions among tree species, releasing remaining trees from light, nutrient or space limitations. Taken together, these disturbances may alter the community composition of tropical forests, with implications for carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem function. To evaluate the effects of hunting and logging on tree fecundity and seed dispersal, we use 3 years of seed rain data from a large-scale observational experiment in previously logged, hunted and protected forests in northern Republic of Congo (Brazzaville). We find that low-intensity logging had a meaningful long-term effect on species-specific seed dispersal distances, though the direction and magnitude varied and was not congruent within dispersal vector. Tree fecundity increased with tree diameter, but did not differ appreciably across disturbance regimes. The species-specific dispersal responses to logging in this study point towards the long-lasting toll of disturbance on ecological function and highlight the necessity of conserving intact forest. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

This study provides information about tree age and growth trajectories as well as climatic-growth signals of H. stigonocarpa in southeastern Brazil. We sampled 13 trees for tree-ring analysis. Tree-ring measurement and analysis were conducted using standard dendrochronological techniques. Sampled trees revealed the young successional stage of the stand, with ages varying from 20 to 35 years old. Nine out of 13 trees were used to build the standard chronology (1981 to 2013) that was positively correlated with precipitation at the end of the growing season (March-April). The chronology was able to capture SST anomalies patterns related to the South American Monsoon System. Growth modeling indicated that minimum logging diameter of 10.4cm is achieved at 24 years of age. The results reported here add valuable contribution to the discussion of sustainable management strategies for Cerrado ecoregion species. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Growth modeling; Sea surface temperature; South America monsoon system; Tree-rings; Tropical forests","Granato-Souza, D.; Federal University of Lavras (UFLA), C.P. 3037, Brazil; email: danigsbio@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058016365

Methods for detecting and monitoring tropical selective logging using satellite data are at an early stage, with current methods only able to detect more intensive timber harvest (&gt;20 m3 ha−1). The spatial resolution of widely available datasets, like Landsat, have previously been considered too coarse to measure the subtle changes in forests associated with less intensive selective logging, yet most present-day logging is at low intensity. We utilized a detailed selective logging dataset from over 11,000 ha of forest in Rondônia, southern Brazilian Amazon, to develop a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm for detecting low-intensity selective logging (&lt;15 m3 ha−1). We show that Landsat imagery acquired before the cessation of logging activities (i.e. the final cloud-free image of the dry season during logging) was better at detecting selective logging than imagery acquired at the start of the following dry season (i.e. the first cloud-free image of the next dry season). Within our study area the detection rate of logged pixels was approximately 90% (with roughly 20% commission and 8% omission error rates) and approximately 40% of the area inside low-intensity selective logging tracts were labelled as logged. Application of the algorithm to 6152 ha of selectively logged forest at a second site in Pará northeast Brazilian Amazon, resulted in the detection of 2316 ha (38%) of selective logging (with 20% commission and 7% omission error rates). This suggests that our method can detect low-intensity selective logging across large areas of the Amazon. It is thus an important step forward in developing systems for detecting selective logging pan-tropically with freely available data sets, and has key implications for monitoring logging and implementing carbon-based payments for ecosystem service schemes. © 2018 The Authors","Brazil; Conservation; Degradation; Landsat; Random Forest; Selective logging; Surface reflectance; Texture measures; Tropical forests","Hethcoat, M.G.; School of Mathematics and Statistics, United Kingdom; email: HethcoatMG@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057719718

Previous work on the effects of anthropogenic activities on biodiversity have concentrated on taxonomic diversity. However, the effects of disturbances such as logging on the functional composition of communities (and thereby, ecosystem function) are poorly understood. Here, we examined variation in the functional traits and assembly processes of tropical montane rain forest communities along a gradient of logging intensity (clear-cut, selective logging, and old-growth) at three spatial scales (100 m2, 400 m2, and 2500 m2) in China. We measured six functional traits of species, including specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf chlorophyll (LChl), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), leaf phosphorus content (LPC), and wood density (WD) in each forest plot. Functional composition changed along the disturbance gradient from logged to old-growth forests. Species with resource-acquisitive strategies (high SLA, LNC, and LPC) dominated the clear-cut forest. In contrast, species with resource-conservative strategies (high LDMC, LChl, and WD) dominated the old-growth forest, while species in the selectively-logged forest showed intermediate values. Across forests with different logging intensities, environmental filtering appeared to be the key process governing community assembly. Spatial scale had a significant effect on functional diversity and community assemblage but did not affect functional traits at the community level. At larger spatial scales, the functional richness and functional dispersion of the three forest types all increased and different community assembly processes were more obvious. Logged forests still need more time to recover levels of functional diversity observed in old-growth forest. Selective logging maintained more functional diversity than clear-cutting in these tropical montane rain forests. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Clear-cut; Community assembly; Forest recovery; Functional composition; Functional diversity; Selective logging; Spatial scale","Zang, R.; Institute of Forest Ecology, China; email: zangrung@caf.ac.cn",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055081445

Termite abundance and diversity drop in selectively logged forest, and it has been hypothesised that this drop is due to a low tolerance to changing micro-climatic conditions. Specifically, the thermal adaptation hypothesis suggests that tropical species are operating at, or close to, their thermal optimum, and therefore, small temperature increases can have drastic effects on abundance, however, other climatic variables such as humidity might also cause termite abundance to drop. We tested termite tolerance to these two climatic variables (temperature and humidity). We found that termites had a higher CT max than expected, and that three traits, feeding group, body sclerotisation, and nesting type, were significantly correlated with CT max . We found that termite desiccation tolerance was low, however, and that all termite genera lost significantly more water in a desiccated environment than in a control. Body sclerotisation, the only trait that was tested, was surprisingly not significantly correlated with desiccation tolerance. Our results suggest that desiccation, rather than ambient temperature, may be the determining factor in dictating termite distributions in modified forests. Should climate change lead to reduced humidity within tropical rainforests, termite abundances and the rates of the functions they perform could be severely reduced. © 2018, The Author(s).","Climate; CT max; Decomposition; Ectotherms; Humidity","Woon, J.S.; Department of Life Sciences, Silwood Park Campus, Buckhurst Road, United Kingdom; email: joel.woon@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054582970

Much knowledge of the impacts of these land-use changes on tropical species comes from studies examining patterns of richness and abundance. Demographic vital rates (survival, reproduction, and movement) can also be affected by land-use change in a way that increases species vulnerability to extirpation, but in many cases these impacts may not be manifested in short-term changes in abundance or species richness. We conducted a literature review to assess current knowledge and research effort concerning how land-use change affects species vital rates in tropical forest vertebrates. We found a general paucity of empirical research on demography across taxa and regions, with some biases toward mammals and birds and land-use transitions, including fragmentation and agriculture. There is also considerable between-species variation in demographic responses to land-use change, which could reflect trait-based differences in species sensitivity, complex context dependencies (e.g., between-region variation), or inconsistency in methods used in studies. Efforts to improve understanding of anthropogenic impacts on species demography are underway, but there is a need for increased research effort to fill knowledge gaps in understudied tropical regions and taxa. The lack of information on demographic impacts of anthropogenic disturbance makes it difficult to draw definite conclusions about the magnitude of threats to tropical ecosystems under anthropogenic pressures.

All trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 10 cm have been measured annually since 1990. The three logging intensities that were applied were: light (T1)-trees harvested with DBH ≥ 55 cm; medium (T2)-DBH ≥ 50 cm; and heavy (T3)-DBH ≥ 40 cm. Control plots (T0) were also monitored. The highest mean annual mortality rates (1.82% ± 0.38), recruitment rates (2.93% ± 0.77) and diameter increments (0.30 ± 0.02 cm) occurred in the T3 treatment. Shifts in dynamics of the forest were mainly caused by a striking increase in a fast-growing pioneer species and their high mortality rates. The loss in stocking caused by mortality was greater than to that of replacement by recruitment. The results demonstrated that selective logging altered the natural dynamics of the forest through increased: mortality rates, recruitment and growth rates of the residual trees. © 2019 by the authors.","Forest dynamics; Logging; Silvicultural treatments; Tree growth; Tree mortality; Tree recruitment; Tropical forests","Amaral, M.R.M.; Forest Management Laboratory (LMF), Brazil; email: marcius.rogerius@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060454685

Two different forest management strategies are practiced in a tropical forest in western Kenya: (1) a protection strategy where human entry is prohibited except for minimalistic human presence (e.g., research activities); and (2) a conservation strategy where human access to the forest and its resources are permitted. We assessed the effects of these management strategies and different levels of disturbance caused by the legacy effects of legal logging activities and the contemporary effects of unauthorized harvesting of forest products on the abundance of guava and non-guava trees and carbon storage in both plant biomass and soil in this forest. We found that guava trees were less likely to thrive and carbon storage in plants and soils was similar in sites with minimal disturbance under both the protection and conservation strategies. However, as disturbance increased, whether by the historical or contemporary effects of human activities, guava trees were more likely to thrive and carbon storage in plants shifted from non-guava trees to guava trees, but without an effect on more stable soil carbon. We conclude that regulations should be strictly enforced to prevent all logging activity, but the conservation strategy would provide similar effects on both forest plant and soil carbon to the protection strategy, while providing benefits to the surrounding community who rely on the forest for cultural and spiritual nourishment. © 2018","Africa; Carbon; Disturbance; Forest; Invasive species; Management; Tropical","Creed, I.F.; University of Saskatchewan, 117 Science Place, Canada; email: irena.creed@usask.ca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054427978

We expected that human activities, including logging and hunting, would have a negative effect on mean occupancy of these taxa. We also predicted that the relative abundance of Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi) would affect prey activity patterns. We conducted systematic camera trap surveys across six study areas on Indonesian Borneo and analysed data using occupancy modelling. Overall, mean occupancy probabilities for the clouded leopard’s prey species within regenerating forests were comparable to those in pristine habitats, but severely decreased at a site with ongoing human disturbance (logging and hunting). Mouse deer and muntjac deer diurnal activity positively correlated with detection rates of clouded leopards across sites, whereas other prey taxa showed no significant relationship. Therefore, some taxa are able to recolonise regenerating forests relatively quickly, but their distribution is reduced when simultaneous logging and hunting occur. In addition, mouse deer and muntjac deer appear able to adjust their activity patterns in response to the risk of predation. Our results provide support for investing conservation efforts of regenerating forests on Indonesian Borneo, which benefits the conservation of important large seed dispersers including primates and ungulates.

Palm oil has historically had a particularly negative reputation for driving deforestation, biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions, social exploitation and damaging health. In the eyes of many in the West, it is regarded as the world's most hated crop. However, palm is highly productive compared with other crops and produces 40% of the worlds edible oil from only 5% of vegetable oil producing land and 0.4% of agricultural land in total. It has the potential to meet future demand for oil with minimum additional environmental and climate impact compared with other sources of vegetable oil. The related high value density has the potential to move millions of vulnerable smallholder farmers out of poverty. Given the conclusions of the IPCC Climate and Land Report, it is therefore important to re-examine the crop's reputation in light of the accumulated evidence and to properly understand the full impacts across the environmental, health, social and economic factors. We present a comprehensive review of the benefits and risks of the crop across these dimensions and provide a new synthesis. We conclude that while oil palm has had a significant negative impact on habitat and biodiversity, it plays a minor role compared with poaching, illegal logging and threats from climate change. There are important opportunities for the industry to reverse this damage. Its reputation for negative health impacts are not backed up by the scientific evidence and indeed there may be health benefits from substituting some oils in the diet with oil palm. Positive social and economic impacts are most obvious in areas where proper market-led economies are in place, but there can be significant negative social impacts in less developed areas. We conclude that much of the reputation of palm oil is not based on a balanced interpretation of the scientific evidence. Provided future development is zero deforestation, does not occur on peat, uses methane capture technology at the mills, empowers indigenous smallholders and supports the regeneration of secondary forest, we conclude that oil palm can be the most environmentally, socially and economically sustainable means to meet future demand for vegetable oil. Indeed, with pro-active collaboration with relevant non-government organisations, oil palm can be part of the solution to reversing the degradation of tropical forest biomes. © 2019 Lembaga Minyak Sawit Malaysia.

Although, little is known about the effect of this practice on the tropical forests of Mexico. The aim was to compare the structure and diversity in forest ejidos under timber harvesting in Quintana Roo. Two inventories (2009) were developed in Permanent Forest Areas (PFA) of medium evergreen forests. In Bacalar, 625 plots of 10x25 m distributed in 15.6 ha were used, while in Noh Bec 302 plots of 10x40m located in 48.32 ha. In each plot, all trees with normal diameter ≥ 7.5 cm were measured to document richness and dasometric variables. Structural indexes (IVI and FMVI) and diversity indexes (Shannon-Wiener H’ and Sorensen Cs) were also calculated. In Bacalar there were 86 tree species (36 families and 81 genera), 284 tree ha-1, 7.3 m2 ha-1 of BA and 86.4 m3 ha-1 of TTV; whereas in Noh Bec, we registered 106 species (34 families and 94 genera), 625 individuals ha-1, 23.9 m2 ha-1 of BA and 183.8 m3 ha-1 of TTV. Bursera simaruba (IVI= 16.6 %, FMVI= 18.1 %) was the dominant species in Bacalar, whereas in Noh Bec it was Pouteria reticulata (IVI= 13.5 %, FMVI= 14.8 %). The species diversity was not different (P &gt; 0.05) between ejidos (H’= 3.48 vs H’= 3.37); nonetheless there was a high floristic similarity (Cs= 60.4 %). Our results provide evidence that timber harvesting associated with the history of natural disturbances drives a key role in the structure and diversity of tropical forests. © 2019, Universidad Austral de Chile.

It is anticipated that different logging activities could be a significant factor that contribute to the emission. Hence, a study was conducted to assess logging emission from different logging techniques, viz. the current selective management system (SMS) - reduced impact logging (RIL) prescription, and the improvised of RIL prescription - low impact logging (LIL) using the Rimbaka machine. The study site is a production forest in the Ulu Jelai Forest Reserve, Lipis, Pahang. Surveys were carried out in monitoring plots of RIL and LIL, including carbon emission from logging activities. Assessment of logging emission indicated that the LIL technique emitted much less carbon into the atmosphere compared to RIL technique. Among the emission components, i.e. skid trails, logging roads and logging decks, the amount of emissions were 37% significantly lower in LIL compared to RIL. In conclusion, improved logging techniques to minimise damages to the residual forest stands are among the mitigation actions taken to reduce carbon emission from timber extraction in the forest. The LIL appears to provide a strategy for managing tropical forest that minimises the potential risks to climate, associated with large changes in carbon emission into the atmosphere. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia","Forest harvesting; Logging emission; Low impact logging; Reduced impact logging",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072308867

Selective logging impacts (e.g. felling gaps, skid trails, logging roads and log landings) were mapped using GPS in the 2014 annual cutting areas (ACAs) of each ejido. We processed and analyzed two pre-harvest Landsat images (2001 and 2013) and one post-harvest image (November 2014) with the CLASlite system, producing maps of degraded, deforested and unlogged areas in each ACA.

To date, the ‘sparing or sharing’ debate has focused on agricultural landscapes, with scant attention paid to forest management. We explore the delivery of biodiversity and wood products in a continuum of sparing-to-sharing scenarios, using spatial optimization with set economic returns in East Kalimantan, Indonesia—a biodiversity hotspot. We found that neither sparing nor sharing extremes are optimal, although the greatest conservation value was attained towards the sparing end of the continuum. Critically, improved management strategies, such as reduced-impact logging, provided larger conservation gains than altering the balance between sparing and sharing, particularly for endangered species. Ultimately, debating sparing versus sharing has limited value while larger gains remain from improving forest management. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Runting, R.K.; School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Australia; email: rebecca.runting@unimelb.edu.au",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059908257

Meanwhile, emerging global agendas are providing unprecedented incentives for large-scale restoration within human-impacted tropical forest landscapes. Whilst logged forests have high conservation value, their adoption within these agendas remains controversial. We review the value of restoring logged tropical forests for boosting economic and environmental resilience. Targeted interventions can recover depleted timber stocks, increase saleable carbon stores, and deliver employment and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) to local communities. Restoration has mixed outcomes for biodiversity but if it improves relogging practices and protects forests from conversion to agricultural plantations may have major positive impacts. We also examine socio-economic and political pathways for upscaling logged forest restoration and their incorporation into sustainable forestry, given political and commercial malaise on post-logging interventions. Spurring these transitions will require strong institutions, executed by policies that enable long-term concession licences and community land tenure, that leverage commercial involvement and payments for ecosystem services, and that optimise existing interventions. Research frontiers include: (a) validating the economic and technical feasibility of different interventions; (b) understanding how these interventions impact on synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services, NTFPs, and biodiversity; and (c) identifying when to restore a logged forest. This requires establishing long-term experimental trials that jointly track environmental and socioeconomic outcomes. Synthesis and applications. Post-logging interventions can deliver various timber, carbon, socioeconomic and potentially biodiversity benefits but are underemployed and undervalued pantropically. Opportunities exist to optimise interventions by tailoring incentives, policies, and management to ecological and social circumstances.

Today it is at serious risk of disappearing due to increasing grazing pressure and logging activities that are leading to environmental problems such as forest fragmentation and soil degradation. The objectives of the study were to: a) evaluate soil physical degradation levels in different grazing areas within the faxinal system; and b) correlate soil degradation, fodder quantity and livestock dynamics in different pasture areas according to the household's location. Landscape mapping, vegetation surveys, and livestock grazing dynamics were assessed. In addition, soil physical parameters were evaluated for each land use (e.g., resistance, bulk density, porosity, moisture, and water infiltration rates). Results showed that livestock grazing and household locations are the main driving forces that lead to forest fragmentation. The household location creates three interrelated gradients in the communal grazing land: 1) soil physical degradation decreases from the pasture areas to araucaria forests; 2) fodder quantity decreases from pastures to araucaria forests; and 3) the livestock grazing intensity decreases from pastures to araucaria forests. In addition, some management practices to mitigate land degradation, including improvement of pastures, installation of removable troughs for drinking water in the upland areas and restriction of livestock from the riparian zone, have been proposed. © 2018 Department of Geography, National University of Singapore and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","land use change; shallow soil; soil quality; subsistence agriculture; subtropical forest","Antoneli, V.; Department of Geography, Campus de Irati, Brazil; email: vaantoneli@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052626881

The implementation of effective forest management strategies that are ecologically beneficial plays thus a central role to prevent forest degradation. However, to identify effective forest management strategies, there is a need for methods supporting the decision-making process. The main objective of our study is to analyze the mid- and long-term impacts of different management intensities, such as varying the minimum stem diameter of harvestable commercial trees, on the dynamic and structure of a species-rich tropical lowland forest of French Guiana. Therefore, we have applied the management module of a dynamic forest model and analyzed simulation experiments for undisturbed forest growth and selective logging. For the first time we were able to quantify the mean recovery times of multiple ecosystem functions and properties (biomass, gross primary production, leaf area index, Shanon diversity, timber volume) after selective logging. Accordingly, we validated simulation results (biomass, number of trees harvested) of selective logging with forest inventory data from the last 32 years. The forest model reliably reproduces the observed pre-logging biomass, tree-size distribution, and logging intensity (10 trees/ha, 39 m3/ha). In addition, it became clear how strongly management with higher logging intensities influences the forest in the long term: (1) the mean recovery times of the investigated ecosystem functions were significantly extended. With very intensive logging (116 m3/ha), the average recovery time of forest biomass was almost twice as long as in a moderate simulation scenario (tint 138 a, tmod 77 a). Similar patterns were observed for other ecosystem functions, e.g. timber volume (tint 158 a, tmod 62 a). (2) Additionally, the functional composition shifted, as up to 30% pioneer tree species in particular invaded the forest. This innovative use of forest growth models may help in the development of ecologically reasonable forest management strategies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass productivity; dbh of lower cutting threshold; Forest gap model FORMIND; Leaf area index; Shannon diversity; Timber volume","Hiltner, U.; Department of Ecological Modelling, Permoserstr. 15, Germany; email: ulrike.hiltner@ufz.de",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052665508

Considering its scale and its contribution to forest management outcome, efficient management of selective logging is crucial to address challenges associated with timber demand, carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. Ongoing selective logging has been a key reason for forest degradation despite a set of recommended practices such as reduced-impact logging. With the objective of drawing the attention of scholars and policy makers to answer the question why effectiveness of selective logging practice is still an issue, we tracked the trend and pattern of scholarly research related to the impact of selective logging. Using a systematic review of literature, we explored and discussed the possible factors hindering implementation of improved forest harvesting practices and the overall knowledge gaps yet not explored in this field of research. This review found consensus among scholars that implementation of improved forest harvesting is still rare despite the constant efforts made by researchers since the 1970s. Based on the review findings we concluded that concentration of research on specific countries, insufficient coverage of diversified forest dimensions/thematic areas, and higher concerns relating to ecological impacts of forest management are the reasons behind poor adoption of research outcomes of improved logging practices. Likewise, their implementation is further hindered by limited attention to the interests and needs of the forest managers/owners, lack of coordination and collaboration among stakeholders and negligible support to develop stakeholders’ capacity. Our review suggests a broadening of the geographical and thematic focus of the study as well as a consideration of effective engagement and capacity development of the forest managers/owners and stakeholders in selective logging policies and practices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity conservation; Carbon sequestration; Forest degradation; Forest harvesting; Forest policy; Reduced- impact logging; Timber recovery","Hari Poudyal, B.; University of Southern QueenslandAustralia; email: Bishnuhari.Poudyal@usq.edu.au",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051376386

Territorial management strategies aim to prevent and mitigate forest loss. Therefore, modeling potential land use changes is important for forest management, monitoring, and evaluation. This study determined whether there are relationships between forest vulnerability to deforestation (potential deforestation distribution) and the forest management policies applied in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Proxy and underlying variables were used to construct a statistical model, based on the principle of maximum entropy that could predict potential land use changes. Entropy can be seen as a measure of uncertainty for a density function. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and the Jackknife Test were used to validate the model. The importance of input variables in the model was determined through: Percent Contribution (PC) and Permutation Importance (PI). The results were compared with prevailing regional forest management strategies. The socioeconomic variables that provided the largest amount of information in the overall model (AUC = 0.81) and that showed most of the information not present in other variables were: “Protected areas-Intangible zone” (PC = 24%, PI = 12.4%), “timber harvesting programs” (PC = 21.7%, PI = 4.7%), “road network” (PC = 18.9%, PI = 7.7%), and “poverty rate” (PC = 3.7%, PI = 6.1%).

Forest policies and management plans should consider integrating and strengthening protected areas and intangible zones, as well as restricting timber harvesting in native forest and establishing forest areas under permanent management. Furthermore, the results also suggested that financial incentive programs to reduce deforestation have to be evaluated because their present distribution is inefficient. In this context, conservation incentive plans need to be revised so that they focus on areas at deforestation risk. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Amazon forest landscapes; Human and environment relationships; Land use management; Sustainable forest management","Bonilla-Bedoya, S.; Research Center for the Territory and Sustainable Habitat, Machala y Sabanilla, Ecuador; email: santiagobonilla@hotmail.es",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049566221

This uncertainty could potentially exacerbate threats to some of the thousands of timber-valuable tree species in the Amazon. Our objective was to determine to what extent long-term responses of tree species regeneration in logged forests can be explained by their functional traits. We integrate functional trait data for 13 leaf, stem, and seed traits from 25 canopy tree species with a range of life histories, such as the pioneer Goupia glabra and the shade-tolerant Iryanthera hostmannii, together with over 30 yr of sapling monitoring in permanent plots spanning a gradient of harvest intensity at the Paracou Forest Disturbance Experiment (PFDE), French Guiana. We anticipated that more intensive logging would increase recruitment of pioneer species with higher specific leaf area, lower wood densities, and smaller seeds, due to the removal of canopy trees. We define a recruitment response metric to compare sapling regeneration to timber harvest intensity across species. Although not statistically significant, sapling recruitment decreased with logging intensity for eight of 23 species and these species tended to have large seeds and dense wood. A generalized linear mixed model fit using specific leaf area, seed mass, and twig density data explained about 45% of the variability in sapling dynamics. Effects of specific leaf area outweighed those of seed mass and wood density in explaining recruitment dynamics of the sapling community in response to increasing logging intensity. The most intense treatment at the PFDE, which includes stand thinning of non-timber-valuable adult trees and poison-girdling for competitive release, showed evidence of shifting community composition in sapling regeneration at the 30-yr mark, toward species with less dense wood, lighter seeds, and higher specific leaf area. Our results indicate that high-intensity logging can have lasting effects on stand regeneration dynamics and that functional traits can help simplify general trends of sapling recruitment for highly diverse logged tropical forests. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America","French Guiana; functional traits; Paracou Forest Disturbance Experiment; recruitment; saplings; selective logging; tropical forest","Hogan, J.A.; International Center for Tropical Botany, United States; email: jhogan@fiu.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057195381

Therefore, understanding the composition of commercial timber species and logging types is key for sustainable forest management in countries like Vietnam as they move toward fulfilling Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) agreements. Seven 1-ha plots were surveyed in the Central Highland of Vietnam, and 18 commercial tree species from these plots, whose timber is widely used by local people for housing and furniture making and timber is easily sold at local markets for high prices, were analyzed. In total, 151 tree species with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of ≥ 10 cm were recorded. The 18 commercially valuable species assessed in this study accounted for 33.2% of all stems (total of 524 stems ha−1 for all species), 47.1% of basal area (total of 34.35 m2 ha−1 for all species), and 50.8% of aboveground biomass/AGB (total of 262.68 Mg ha−1 for all species). Practicing diameter-limit harvesting of all commercially valuable species with DBH of ≥ 40 cm, which is widely performed in Vietnam, will reduce the number of stems by 7%, basal area by 31.6%, and AGB by 38.2%. Because such harvesting practices cause severe ecological impacts on the remaining forest, logged forests may require &gt; 40 years to recover the structure status of a pre-logged forest. In addition, the recovery of the 18 commercially valuable species may require a much longer time because they comprised 33.2% of stems. Permission for logging natural forests should be given in Vietnam to sustain lives of local communities, where logging has been prohibited. However, alternative harvesting systems, such as reduced-impact logging systems, should be considered. The systems selected must simultaneously generate economic returns for local people and respect the REDD+ agreements with regard to protecting biodiversity and reducing carbon emissions. © 2018, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Logging system; REDD; Sustainable management; Timber species; Tropical forest","Van Do, T.; Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere, Japan; email: dotranvan@hotmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050584121

Often many types of ecosystem services are derived from a single plant species, introducing the potential for tensions between forest users. Despite the potential for forest users having different approaches to how a plant is used, little has been done to understand how a plant species’ sustainability may be impacted by opposing views on their utility. In this paper, the inherent properties of plants were used to propose a conceptual approach for comparing the values of plant species from the perspectives of commercial loggers and indigenous peoples. Using the provisioning ecosystem services associated with a sample of plants from the Rupununi, Southern Guyana, commercial logging and subsistence use indices were developed to compare how plant species may be perceived by the two opposing views of tropical forest management. The analysis suggested that for more than 84% of plants the subsistence value indices were greater than the logging indices. This study suggested that by examining opposing approaches to forest management, and adopting indices to document how different users approach plants, forest managers can begin to answer questions on where in space, and for which species, conservation and management efforts should be pursued. The methods proposed in this paper can be used by indigenous peoples and their allies to make spatial optimization decisions on their use of forest resources for conservation and payment for ecosystem services initiatives such as REDD+. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Codes of practice for logging; Guyana; Multiple-use plants; Rupununi","Shah, M.; Geospatial Information Sciences, 800 W.

With ongoing global (i.e. land-use and climate) changes, tropical forests are currently facing deep and rapid modifications in disturbance regimes that may hamper their recovering capacity so that developing robust predictive model able to predict ecosystem resilience and recovery becomes of primary importance for decision-making: (i) Do regenerating forests recover faster than mature forests given the same level of disturbance? (ii) Is the local topography an important predictor of the post-disturbance forest trajectories? (iii) Is the community functional composition, assessed with community weighted-mean functional traits, a good predictor of carbon stock recovery? (iv) How important is the climate stress (seasonal drought and/or soil water saturation) in shaping the recovery trajectory? Methods: Paracou is a large scale forest disturbance experiment set up in 1984 with nine 6.25 ha plots spanning on a large disturbance gradient where 15 to 60% of the initial forest ecosystem biomass were removed. More than 70,000 trees belonging to ca. 700 tree species have then been censused every 2 years up today. Using this unique dataset, we aim at deciphering the endogenous (forest structure and composition) and exogenous (local environment and climate stress) drivers of ecosystem recovery in time. To do so, we disentangle carbon recovery into demographic processes (recruitment, growth, mortality fluxes) and cohorts (recruited trees, survivors). Results: Variations in the pre-disturbance forest structure or in local environment do not shape significantly the ecosystem recovery rates. Variations in the pre-disturbance forest composition and in the post-disturbance climate significantly change the forest recovery trajectory. Pioneer-rich forests have slower recovery rates than assemblages of late-successional species. Soil water saturation during the wet season strongly impedes ecosystem recovery but not seasonal drought. From a sensitivity analysis, we highlight the pre-disturbance forest composition and the post-disturbance climate conditions as the primary factors controlling the recovery trajectory. Conclusions: Highly-disturbed forests and secondary forests because they are composed of a lot of pioneer species will be less able to cope with new disturbance. In the context of increasing tree mortality due to both (i) severe droughts imputable to climate change and (ii) human-induced perturbations, tropical forest management should focus on reducing disturbances by developing Reduced Impact Logging techniques. © 2018, The Author(s).","Amazonia; Carbon fluxes; Climate change; Ecological resilience; Ecosystem modeling; Tropical forests","Hérault, B.; INPHB (Institut National Polytechnique Félix Houphouët Boigny)Cote d'Ivoire; email: bruno.herault@cirad.fr",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049905651

In Indonesia, profit sharing and agroforestry are examples of partnership programs between forest managers and local communities. In this paper, we analyze potential conflicts among participants in these programs. First, we derive a recursive formula to determine the future value of a compartment of plantation to the society, which includes both the forest owner and the local community. While trees are young, the land is also used for agriculture, which is an agroforestry program. When there is a high rate of future discounting and a high rate of natural disturbances, the society may find it profitable to continue the agricultural use of the land. Second, we calculate the profit for the forest owner and the local community separately. To prevent illegal logging, the owner shares a fraction of the profit obtained by selling logs with the local people, which is a profit-sharing program. Illegal logging greatly reduces the profit for the forest owner, especially when trees are tall. Illegal logging of old cohorts is harmful to the local people as well. In contrast, illegal logging of young cohorts provides profit to the local people because they will be hired to replant young trees. Our analysis shows an “overlooking period” in which a conflict of interest exists between the forest owner and the local community. We indicate that the overlooking period can be mitigated by coordination of the shared profit and the wage for the workers. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Dynamic programing; Illegal logging; Plantation; Social forestry; Timing of tree harvest","Kubo, Y.; Department of Biology, 774 Motooka, Nishi-ku, Japan; email: yukikubo@kyudai.jp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047909178

To explore this, we compared the dynamics of secies diversity between unlogged forest plot (18.6 ha) and logged forest plot (5.4 ha). We found that 40 years are not sufficient to recover species diversity after logging.

This pattern is of interest due to what it portends for forest structure, timber production, carbon sequestration and multiple other values given that intensified El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of droughts in the Amazon region. What remains unclear is what characteristics of large trees render them especially vulnerable to drought-induced mortality and how this vulnerability changes with forest degradation. Using a large-scale, long-term silvicultural experiment in a transitional Amazonian forest in Bolivia, we disentangle the effects of stem diameter, tree height, crown exposure and logging-induced degradation on risks of drought-induced mortality during the 2004/2005 ENSO event. Overall, tree mortality increased in response to drought in both logged and unlogged plots. Tree height was a much stronger predictor of mortality than stem diameter. In unlogged plots, tree height but not crown exposure was positively associated with drought-induced mortality, whereas in logged plots, neither tree height nor crown exposure was associated with drought-induced mortality. Our results suggest that, at the scale of a site, hydraulic factors related to tree height, not air humidity, are a cause of elevated drought-induced mortality of large trees in unlogged plots.

This study investigated whether, after forest management involving the removal of eucalyptus, ultrastructural adjustments in the chloroplast fostered the photoacclimation of the most abundant regenerating native species in a Brazilian Atlantic forest biological reserve. The influence of seasonality on photosynthetic activity and water use efficiency after the forest management was also assessed. To achieve this, in the rainy season mature leaves of native tree saplings (Xylopia sericea, Siparuna guianensis, and Byrsonima sericea) were subjected to ultrastructural analyses and the C isotopic composition (δ 13 C) was determined; and in the dry and rainy season gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured. Species samples were obtained in: secondary forest, a eucalyptus understory with 15 years of regeneration before and 12 months after the management, and from herbarium samples from eucalyptus understories collected at the beginning of forest regeneration (9–16 years ago, for δ 13 C analyses only). Ultrastructural alterations such as the reorganization of thylakoids, starch grain changes, and the presence of plastoglobules and oils were verified after the management in all the species. F v /F m values varied between 0.80 and 0.90 regardless of the management or season of the year. There was a reduction of C assimilation after the management, especially in the dry season. 13 C enrichment was observed for B. sericea, S. guianensis, and X. sericea in herbarium samples (−31.4‰, −32.0‰, and −31.4‰, respectively) and after the forest management (−31.2‰, −32.5‰, −31.4‰), while samples depleted in 13 C were registered before the management (−33.4‰, −33.3‰, −33.2‰) and in the secondary forest (−34.0‰, −33.9‰, and −33.6‰). The data suggest that ultrastructural alterations may have aided in maintaining electron flow after the increase in irradiance due to the forest management, avoiding photochemical stress, as evidenced by F v /F m values. The forest management increased the efficiency of water use and fostered abiotic conditions similar to those present at the beginning of the understory regeneration. These previous conditions favored the current high level of abundance of these three species, highlighting the importance of monitoring to ensure that the management practices do not promote the future dominance of few species at the expense this biome's high biodiversity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Atlantic forest; C isotopes; Gas exchange; Leaf traits","Vitória, A.P.; Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Av.

By 2014, there were 47 federal extractive reserves in Brazil’s Legal Amazonia region, of which 45 were in the Amazonian Tropical Forest Biome and 26 extractive reserves belonged to states, all of which were in the Amazonia Biome. This study provides data for each of the 73 extractive reserves in Legal Amazonia, based on biomass information by forest type calculated from RadamBrasil survey data, and deforestation from PRODES monitoring by LANDSAT or equivalent satellites (30-m resolution). The stocks represent carbon in the “pre-modern” biomass, that is, the biomass present in approximately 1970, or before substantial deforestation or logging activity in the region. The carbon losses reflect only deforestation, not degradation of forest by logging and/or fire. The total area of extractive reserves in Legal Amazonia amounted to 126,709 km2, of which 4301 km2 (3.4%) had been cleared by 2014. Those extractive reserves had a remaining carbon stock in forest vegetation (above and below-ground) of 2.1 billion tons. The carbon lost to deforestation totaled 74.9 million tons. Avoiding further carbon loss to both deforestation and degradation needs to be a high priority for the extractivists, as it is the value of the forest’s environmental services that has the greatest potential for providing a means of support that is increasing in value and is inherently sustainable. © 2018 Universidade Federal do Parana.

We examined the responses of ground-dwelling wildlife to logging intensity in two certified forest management units under the same climate and vegetation in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, in 2012–2016. A total of ten and 13 circular plots with a diameter of 1 km were established respectively, and 10–18 camera points were distributed randomly in each plot to record wildlife for two years. A total of 41 species of medium to large-sized terrestrial wildlife were recorded in the two management units. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was performed to examine the response of wildlife community to the logging influences with the following three variables: forest intactness (as a surrogate of tree-species composition), above-ground carbon (as a surrogate of forest structure), and distance to the nearest village to represent hunting pressure. Forest intactness was the strongest factor affecting the assemblage of wildlife species in both management units, suggesting that changes in tree-species composition due to logging were a decisive factor influencing animal assemblage. Poisson Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was employed to examine the response of each species to forest intactness in each management unit. We found that eight out of the 32 tested wildlife species responded to forest intactness consistently between the two units, while the other species responded more individualistically. We suggest that consistent responses of several species, as well as individualistic responses of the other species to the changes of tree-species composition, determine the animal assemblage in logged-over Bornean rainforests. Sustainably managed logged-over forests in Borneo are a habitat for diverse wildlife community and therefore also require attention for biodiversity conservation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity conservation; Camera-traps; Forest intactness; Terrestrial wildlife; Tree species composition","Jati, A.S.Perumahan Salatiga Permai No. 104, Kel.

Despite the ubiquity of these human-modified forests, we have a limited knowledge of their potential to recover key traits linked to ecosystem processes and consequent services. Here we present data from 31,095 trees and saplings distributed across 121 plots of undisturbed and disturbed primary forests as well as secondary forests in the eastern Amazon. We examined the post-disturbance recovery trajectory of an important plant functional trait, wood density. We tested whether human-modified Amazonian forests are experiencing a rapid or a slow, or even impeded, recovery of this trait, which is associated with the provision of a fundamental ecosystem service—carbon storage. As expected, we found that the plot-level wood density of trees and saplings in disturbed primary and secondary forests was significantly lower than in undisturbed forests. However, there was no significant difference in the average wood density of saplings between disturbed primary and secondary forests, possibly indicating a process of secondarization. We also found evidence that the recovery of wood density in human-modified forests is being severely disrupted due to edge effects (in the case of disturbed primary forests) and high liana densities (in the case of both disturbed primary and secondary forests). Surprisingly, these two factors were more important predictors of wood density recovery than the time elapsed since the disturbance event. Synthesis. Plant communities in human-modified Amazonian forests appear to not be recovering a key functional property—wood density, which in turn may affect their ability to store carbon in the future. If the aim of conservation programs in tropical forests is to maintain existing rates of ecosystem functions, processes and services, then they must concentrate efforts on avoiding anthropogenic disturbance in areas of currently undisturbed forests. It is also vital to prevent further disturbance in human-modified forests to avoid disrupting even more their recovery. © 2018 The Authors.

Anthropogenic disturbances, such as selective logging can affect within-forest microclimate through effects on forest structure, leading to indirect effects on forests beyond the immediate impact of logging. However, the scope and predictability of these effects remains poorly understood. Here we use a microclimate thermal proxy (sensitive to radiative, convective, and conductive heat fluxes) measured at the forest floor in three 1-ha forest plots spanning a logging intensity gradient in Malaysian Borneo. We show (1) that thermal proxy ranges and spatiotemporal heterogeneity are doubled between old growth and heavily logged forests, with extremes often exceeding 45°C, (2) that nearby weather station air temperatures provide estimates of maximum thermal proxy values that are biased down by 5–10°C, and (3) that lower canopy density, higher canopy height, and higher biomass removal are associated with higher maximum temperatures. Thus, logged forests are less buffered from regional climate change than old growth forests, and experience much higher microclimate extremes and heterogeneity. Better predicting the linkages between regional climate and its effects on within-forest microclimate will be critical for understanding the wide range of conditions experienced within tropical forests. © Copyright © 2018 Blonder, Both, Coomes, Elias, Jucker, Kvasnica, Majalap, Malhi, Milodowski, Riutta and Svátek.","Borneo; disturbance; environmental heterogeneity; forest structure; logging; microclimate","Blonder, B.; Environmental Change Institute, United Kingdom; email: bblonder@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059856874

These activities may have long-term consequences, which impact forest recovery. We investigated the legacy of historical anthropogenic land use on the current reproductive effort (RE) and success of the understory, myco-heterotrophic orchid, Wullschlaegelia calcarata in Puerto Rico's tropical rain forest after 80 years of forest recovery. Methods: Our study site was the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot in the Luquillo Experimental Forest. We used six 10 m × 500 m transect lines that spanned areas with differing levels of historic canopy coverage which are correlated with land use history. We recorded the abundance of W. calcarata plants and measured shoot height, number of flowers, fruit set for all plants and seed set from the most mature, undehisced fruit on a random subset of plants measured. We sought to determine whether or not there is a legacy of land use history on the RE and success of W. calcarata. Of the varying degrees of historic disturbance, we predicted that RE and success would be highest in minimally disturbed old-growth forest, and that soil type differences would be insufficient to affect RE or success. Important Findings: We found 1607 plants of W. calcarata, and only one was detected in the most historically disturbed area of the forest. The orchids were most abundant in the two least historically disturbed sites. However, the prevailing trend in all measures of RE is in the opposite direction with greater RE in the forest plots with intermediate levels of historical disturbance. Furthermore, the best model (as a function of AICc and weights) to predict RE is a combination of soil type and cover class. Nevertheless, our measures of reproductive success (fruit and seed set) were best in the least historically disturbed sites and were not associated with soil type. Thus, the best sites for growth are not always the same as those for abundance and reproduction, and after >80 years of recovery, components of the rainforest community have not fully recovered. © 2018 The Author(s).","disturbance ecology; Forest recovery; Orchidaceae; tropical forest; Wullschlaegelia","Ackerman, J.D.; Department of Biology, 17 Ave Universidad, United States; email: ackerman.upr@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063163785

Despite a large literature and emerging consensus demonstrating a high conservation value of selectively logged tropical rainforests, few studies have taken a long-term perspective. We resampled small mammals (≤ 1 kg) in a heavily logged landscape in Sabah, Borneo between 2011 and 2016 to investigate temporal patterns of species-level changes in population density. We found that small mammal population density in heavily logged forest was highly variable among years, consistent with patterns previously observed in unlogged forest, and uncovered evidence suggesting that one species is potentially declining towards local extinction. Across nine species, population densities varied almost sevenfold during our 6-year study period, highlighting the extremely dynamic nature of small mammal communities in this ecosystem. Strictly terrestrial murid species tended to exhibit strong temporal dynamics, whereas semi-arboreal foraging species such as treeshrews had more stable dynamics. We found no relationships between population density and fruit/seed mass, and therefore no evidence that our patterns represent responses to inter-annual mast fruiting of the dominant canopy dipterocarp trees. This may be due to the removal of most of the canopy during logging, and hence the dipterocarp seed resource, although it possibly also reflects spatiotemporal limitations of our data. Our results underline the importance of understanding long-term variability in animal communities before developing conservation and management recommendations for human-altered ecosystems. © 2018, The Author(s).","Logging; Population dynamics; Small mammals; Temporal change; Tropical forest","Chapman, P.M.; Department of Life Sciences, Silwood Park, Buckhurst Road, United Kingdom; email: p.chapman14@imperial.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051636160

However, disturbances such as deforestation and forest degradation threaten the maintenance of these ecosystem services. This study aimed to understand how different disturbance histories affect the forest stand biomass, as well as species and functional diversity, and to what extent these differences can change the relationships between biomass and their drivers. We used data from forests with clear-cut and selectively logged disturbance histories, and from old-growth forests, situated in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Forests with logging disturbances showed significant losses in their aboveground biomass compared to those of old-growth forests (50% loss in selectively logged forests and 80% loss in clear-cut forests). Interestingly, only clear-cut secondary forests showed differences in species and functional diversity, and were dominated by species with acquisitive trait values, commonly found early in succession. Shifts in stand biomass drivers were observed in selectively logged forests. The mass-ratio hypothesis (mainly through the functional trait of maximum height) was the most important biomass driver in clear-cut secondary and old-growth forests, whereas the importance of the niche complementarity hypothesis (through functional richness and dispersion) was higher in selectively logged forests. Our study highlights that disturbance histories can affect forest aboveground biomass and its drivers. Moreover, our results reinforce the need for conservation of intact forests but highlight the importance of including degraded forests in conservation mechanisms based in carbon stocks, as these forests retain high values of species and functional diversities that are crucial to biomass and consequently carbon stock acquisition. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon stocks; Clear-cut secondary forests; Deforestation; Forest degradation; Mass-ratio; Niche complementarity; Selectively logged forests; Species and functional diversity","Pyles, M.V.; Biology Institute, Av.

Tropical forests are also increasingly affected by anthropogenic disturbances. However, there is still much uncertainty around the capacity of tropical forests to recover their timber volume after logging as well as other disturbances such as fires, large blow-downs and extreme droughts, and thus on the long-term sustainability of logging. We developed an original Bayesian hierarchical model of Volume Dynamics with Differential Equations (VDDE) to infer the dynamic of timber volumes as the result of two ecosystem processes: volume gains from tree growth and volume losses from tree mortality. Both processes are expressed as explicit functions of the forest maturity, i.e. the overall successional stage of the forest that primarily depends on the frequency and severity of the disturbances that the forest has undergone. As a case study, the VDDE model was calibrated with data from Paracou, a long-term disturbance experiment in a neotropical forest where over 56 ha of permanent forest plots were logged with different intensities and censused for 31 years. With this model, we could predict timber recovery at Paracou at the end of a cutting cycle depending on the logging intensity, the rotation cycle length, and the proportion of commercial volume. The VDDE modelling framework developed presents three main advantages: (i) it can be calibrated with large tree inventories which are widely available from national forest inventories or logging concession management plans and are easy to measure, both on the field and with remote sensing; (ii) it depends on only a few input parameters, which can be an advantage in tropical regions where data availability is scarce; (iii) the modelling framework is flexible enough to explicitly include the effect of other types of disturbances (both natural and anthropogenic: e.g. blow-downs, fires and climate change) on the forest maturity, and thus to predict future timber provision in the tropics in a context of global changes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Disturbance; Ecosystem modelling; Recovery; Sustainability; Tropical forest management","Piponiot, C.; Université de la Guyane, France; email: camille.piponiot@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049882892

However, liana removal studies may be one of the most common experimental manipulations in tropical forest ecology. In this review, we synthesize data from 64 tropical liana removal experiments conducted over the past 90 yr. We explore the direction and magnitude of the effects of lianas on tree establishment, growth, survival, reproduction, biomass accretion, and plant and animal diversity in ecological and forestry studies. We discuss the geographical biases of liana removal studies and compare the various methods used to manipulate lianas. Overall, we found that lianas have a clear negative effect on trees, and trees benefitted from removing lianas in nearly every study across all forest types. Liana cutting significantly increased light and water availability, and trees responded with vastly greater reproduction, growth, survival, and biomass accumulation compared to controls where lianas were present. Removing lianas during logging significantly reduced damage of future merchantable trees and improved timber production. Our review demonstrates that lianas have an unequivocally detrimental effect on every metric of tree performance measured, regardless of forest type, forest age, or geographic location. However, lianas also appear to have a positive contribution to overall forest plant diversity and to different animal groups. Therefore, managing lianas reduces logging damage and improves timber production; however, the removal lianas may also have a negative effect on the faunal community, which could ultimately harm the plant community. © 2018 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","competition; experimental ecology; forestry; liana-tree interaction; removal experiments; tropical forests","Estrada-Villegas, S.; Department of Biological Sciences, PO Box 1881, United States; email: estradavillegassergio@gmail.com",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053275631

Logging negatively affects the population growth rate ofP. massoniana, which facilitates the growth of individual trees but has no effect on reproduction probability. The survival and growth of seedlings contribute the most to population growth. Context: Subtropical forest degradation caused by unreasonable disturbances is closely related to anthropogenic activities in Southeast China, and the frequent small-scale logging activity by local people was the dominated disturbance regime in forests in this region over the past several decades. Aims: The objective of this study is to evaluate the demographic consequences of logging on Pinus massoniana, a pioneer tree species, at individual level (survival, growth, and fecundity) and population level (the population growth rate and size distribution) over short-term period. Methods: The size of tree individuals was combined with vital rates using various modeling approaches based on demographic data from three annual censuses. The integral projection model (IPM) was constructed and used to conduct comparative demographic analyses. Results: Logging negatively affected the population growth rate: from a slight expansion before logging to a moderate decline after logging. This study found a significant reduction in seedling recruitment after logging, and plant growth and mortality were slightly enhanced. The survival of seedlings greatly contributes to population growth rate compared to other life stages for both periods (before and after logging) while its relative importance decreases after logging. Seedling growth is also important to population growth, and its relative importance increased after logging. Shrinkage and fecundity have a minimal contribution effect on the population growth rate. Conclusion: Growing plants in a nursery with a similar demography to P. massoniana could be beneficial for pioneer species regeneration in that this will improve the survival rate and growth of small individuals after logging. © 2018, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Degraded subtropical forest; Elasticity; Integral projection model; Logging; Pinus massoniana; Pioneer tree demography","Li, S.; State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Mountain Ecology (Funded by Ministry of Science and Technology and Fujian Province), China; email: lisz126@126.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051730200

These problems are often a result of the environmentally unsustainable logging practices of industrial logging companies. Beginning in the 1990s, six organizations attempted to mitigate the deforestation and forest degradation occurring in PNG by facilitating small-scale native forest management by Indigenous forest landowners. All six organizations utilized an ‘eco-forestry’ approach, involving selective harvesting of timber combined with the milling of timber by Indigenous forest landowners using portable sawmills. The lumber produced was sold into local and international markets as sustainable certified under Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) principles. The use of portable sawmills was also intended to provide the landowners with a greater financial return compared to the timber royalty payments they could receive from logging companies. This study used a literature review and interviews with key informants from the eco-forestry organizations and the PNG Forest Authority to assess the effectiveness of variants of the portable sawmilling model. We found that each of the six organizations were unsuccessful in developing a financially viable model for small-scale native forest management by Indigenous forest landowners in PNG. All the Indigenous landowners were unable to continue their portable sawmill operations once the donor funding of the eco-forestry organizations ceased. In addition, the operators of portable sawmills struggled to produce lumber that met the quality and quantity demands of buyers, who ultimately ceased purchasing the lumber. Furthermore, the Indigenous landowners struggled to adhere to the FSC principles, resulting in a loss of FSC certification. The study identifies a need for a new small-scale native forest management model in PNG. We recommend that future research involve collaboration with private sector businesses and professionally trained operators to inform the development of a small-scale forest management model which is financially profitable while also adhering to the principles of eco-forestry. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Community forestry; Native forest harvesting; Portable sawmills; Reduced impact logging; Small-scale forestry; Sustainable tropical forestry","Scudder, M.G.; Tropical Forests and People Research Centre, Locked Bag 4, Maroochydore Dc, Australia; email: mscudder@usc.edu.au",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048793336

Our paper used satellite-derived deforestation data and statistical matching techniques to examine patterns of deforestation and timber production in the Republic of Congo after the implementation of FM plans in timber concessions. We found that a) deforestation rates were higher in concessions that had a registered forest management plan (FMP) compared to those that did not; b) deforestation rates increased after a concession adopted a FMP; and c) timber production was higher and more stable in concessions that adopted a FMP than in concessions that did not. In their response, Karsenty et al. (2017) question our analytical approach and advocate for different evaluative criteria. While their response offers new and potentially valuable perspectives, it also criticizes our paper for errors our paper does not contain, and suggests we should have carried out analyses that we already did. In this rejoinder, we discuss the extent to which we consider their arguments relevant, valid, and worthy of further study. We note that neither Karsenty et al.

In degraded forests,seedling recruitment of canopy trees is vital for forest regeneration and recovery. Weinvestigated how selective logging, a pervasive driver of tropical forest degradation,impacts canopy tree seedling recruitment, focusing on an endemic dipterocarpDryobalanops lanceolata in Sabah, Borneo. During a mast-fruiting event in intensivelylogged and nearby unlogged forest, we examined four stages of the seedling recruitment process: seed production, seed predation, and negative density-dependentgermination and seedling survival. Our results suggest that each stage of the seedlingrecruitment process is altered in logged forest. The seed crop of D. lanceolata trees inlogged forest was one-third smaller than that produced by trees in unlogged forest.The functional role of vertebrates in seed predation increased in logged forest whilethat of non-vertebrates declined. Seeds in logged forest were less likely to germinatethan those in unlogged forest. Germination increased with local-scale conspecificseed density in unlogged forest, but seedling survival tended to decline. However,both germination and seedling survival increased with local-scale conspecific seeddensity in logged forest. Notably, seed crop size, germination, and seedling survivaltended to increase for larger trees in both unlogged and logged forests, suggestingthat sustainable timber extraction and silvicultural practices designed to minimizedamage to the residual stand are important to prevent seedling recruitment failure.Overall, these impacts sustained by several aspects of seedling recruitment in a mastfruiting year suggest that intensive selective logging may affect long-term populationdynamics of D. lanceolata.

Peat swamps act as refuge for many endangered species, and they may turn into a net producer of CO2 and greatly contribute to climate change if cleared and drained.

In this paper, we used a grid-based sampling plot protocol to sample termites in Brunei. We sampled termite communities in pristine and selectively logged peat swamp forests, that we compared with termite communities sampled in heath and dipterocarp forests. More precisely, we determined: (i) termite species diversity in peat swamp forests, and (ii) how termites respond to peat swamp logging. We found that species richness was the highest in the mixed dipterocarp forest. Selective logging had limited impact on species richness in peat swamp forest, suggesting that termite communities are resilient to limited amount of perturbations.

Here, we report primary humid tropical forest extent for the year 2001, and primary forest loss and distance to loss from 2002-2014 for the largest rainforest countries of Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and Indonesia. Brazil's total area of primary forest loss is more than twice that of Indonesia and five times that of DRC. Despite unprecedented success in slowing deforestation along its forest frontier, Brazil's most remote forests are increasingly nearer to loss, as extractive activities such as logging and mining intrude upon previously intact forests. In absolute terms, DRC has the lowest area of primary forest loss; however, its forests are increasingly encroached upon as smallholder agriculturalists move into remaining forests, often to escape conflict and insecurity. The decrease in DRC forests' distance to loss as a function of area of forest loss was five times that of Brazil or Indonesia. In 2014, Indonesia had the least area of remaining primary forest. Despite an announced moratorium on concession licenses in 2011, Indonesia exhibited a rate of primary forest loss twice that of DRC and triple that of Brazil by the end of the study period. Forest loss dynamics in Indonesia range from industrial-scale clearing of coastal peatlands to logging of interior montane rainforests. While results illustrate considerable variation in forest loss dynamics between the three countries, the dominant narrative is of ongoing exploitation of primary humid tropical forests. © 2018 The Author(s).

Seven root traits were considered: four associated with resource exploitation potential or an ‘extensive’ strategy (fine-root biomass, length, surface area, and volume), and three traits which reflect exploitation efficiency or an ‘intensive’ strategy (specific root area, specific root length, and root tissue density). We found that total fine-root biomass, length, surface area, volume, and fine-root tissue density were higher in the logged-over forest, whereas the old growth forest had higher total specific root length and specific root surface area than the logged-over forest.

It remains, however, largely unclear how above-ground biomass (AGB) recovery of species-rich tropical forests is affected by disturbance intensity and post-disturbance (remaining) tree-community attributes, following logging and thinning interventions. We investigated whether annual AGB increment (∆AGB) decreases with management-related disturbance intensity (disturbance hypothesis), and increases with the diversity (niche-complementarity hypothesis) and the community-weighted mean (CWM) of acquisitive traits of dominant species (biomass-ratio hypothesis) in the remaining tree community. We analysed data from a long-term forest-management experiment in the Brazilian Amazon over two recovery periods: post-logging (1983–1989) and post-thinning (1995–2012). We computed the ∆AGB of surviving trees, recruit trees and of the total tree community. Disturbance intensity was quantified as basal area reduction and basal area remaining. Remaining diversity (taxonomic, functional and structural) and CWM of five functional traits linked to biomass productivity (specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen and phosphorous concentration, leaf toughness and wood density) were calculated for the post-intervention inventories. Predictors were related to response variables using multiple linear regressions and structural equation modelling. We found support for the disturbance hypothesis in both recovery periods. AGB increment of survivors and of the total tree community increased with basal area remaining, indicating the importance of remaining growing stock for biomass recovery. Conversely, AGB increment of recruit trees increased with basal area reduction because changes in forest structure increased resource availability for young trees. We did not find consistent support for the niche-complementarity and biomass-ratio hypotheses, possibly because of a high redundancy in these extremely species-rich forests. Synthesis and applications. The intensity of disturbance through management, expressed as basal area reduction and basal area remaining, was consistently more important for explaining forest biomass recovery following harvesting and thinning than remaining diversity or trait composition. This points to the importance of controlling logging and thinning intensity in forests of the eastern Amazon. Given the high intervention intensities applied in this experiment, it is likely that low to moderate harvesting intensities permitted by the current legislation for the Brazilian Amazon (30 m³/ha) will not impair biomass recovery in these forests. © 2018 The Authors.

Yet there is relatively little information on how interspecific variation in WD correlates with biomass dynamics at the species and population level. We determined changes in biomass in permanent plots in a logged forest in Vietnam from 2004 to 2012, a period representing the last 8 years of a 30 years logging cycle. We measured diameter at breast height (DBH) and estimated aboveground biomass (AGB) growth, mortality, and net AGB increment (the difference between AGB gains and losses through growth and mortality) per species at the individual and population (i.e. corrected for species abundance) level, and correlated these with WD. At the population level, mean net AGB increment rates were 6.47 Mg ha−1 year−1 resulting from a mean AGB growth of 8.30 Mg ha−1 year−1, AGB recruitment of 0.67 Mg ha−1 year−1 and AGB losses through mortality of 2.50 Mg ha−1 year−1. Across species there was a negative relationship between WD and mortality rate, WD and DBH growth rate, and a positive relationship between WD and tree standing biomass. Standing biomass in turn was positively related to AGB growth, and net AGB increment both at the individual and population level. Our findings support the view that high wood density species contribute more to total biomass and indirectly to biomass increment than low wood density species in tropical forests. Maintaining high wood density species thus has potential to increase biomass recovery and carbon sequestration after logging. © 2018, The Author(s).","Biomass; Carbon dynamics; Demographic rates; Tropical forest; Vietnam","Nam, V.T.; Vietnam Administration of Forestry, No 2, Ngoc Ha, Ba Dinh, Viet Nam; email: Nam@vnforest.gov.vn",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047798980

Substantial emissions are from selective logging, a land-use activity that decreases forest carbon density. To maintain carbon values in selectively logged forests, climate change mitigation policies and government agencies promote the adoption of reduced-impact logging (RIL) practices. However, whether RIL will maintain both carbon and timber values in managed tropical forests over time remains uncertain. In this study, we quantify the recovery of timber stocks and aboveground carbon at an experimental site where forests were subjected to different intensities of RIL (4, 8, and 16 trees/ha). Our census data span 20 years postlogging and 17 years after the liberation of future crop trees from competition in a tropical forest on the Guiana Shield, a globally important forest carbon reservoir. We model recovery of timber and carbon with a breakpoint regression that allowed us to capture elevated tree mortality immediately after logging. Recovery rates of timber and carbon were governed by the presence of residual trees (i.e., trees that persisted through the first harvest). The liberation treatment stimulated faster recovery of timber albeit at a carbon cost. Model results suggest a threshold logging intensity beyond which forests managed for timber and carbon derive few benefits from RIL, with recruitment and residual growth not sufficient to offset losses. Inclusion of the breakpoint at which carbon and timber gains outpaced postlogging mortality led to high predictive accuracy, including out-of-sample R2 values &gt;90%, and enabled inference on demographic changes postlogging. Our modeling framework is broadly applicable to studies that aim to quantify impacts of logging on forest recovery. Overall, we demonstrate that initial mortality drives variation in recovery rates, that the second harvest depends on old growth wood, and that timber intensification lowers carbon stocks. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon stocks; climate change mitigation; forest degradation; piecewise regression; REDD+; sustainable forest management; tropical forestry","Roopsind, A.; Biological Sciences, United States; email: anandroopsind@boisestate.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047465518

Species with restricted habitat requirements and slow reproductive rates, such as the spectacular hornbills (Bucerotidae) of the Paleotropics, are particularly vulnerable. We present the first long-term quantitative population assessment of nine forest hornbill species in Ghana, part of the Upper Guinea forest biodiversity hotspot in West Africa. From 1990 to 2009, hornbill encounter rates declined with 32–88% across eight species found in the region. Seven separate surveys between 1990 and 2014 indicated declines in at least six of eight species detected, with large-bodied species hardest hit. Depleted remnant populations of large hornbills mainly persist in two large and relatively well-protected wildlife reserves, Ankasa Resource Reserve and Kakum National Park. Contrastingly, the five largest species of the nine hornbills known to Bia Biosphere Reserve, one of Ghana's few forest wildlife reserves, apparently vanished completely since the 1990s, mainly due to uncontrolled hunting. Similarly, several large hornbills have disappeared from forest reserves where hunting is widespread. We conclude that uncontrolled hunting is the major driver of the recent drastic declines and population extirpations of large hornbills, while reductions in small insectivorous species may be related to extensive fragmentation and habitat disturbances of the Ghanaian forest biome. We call for urgent conservation action to prevent further declines and impending extirpations of forest hornbills and other wildlife in West Africa. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bucerotidae; Conservation status; Forest fragmentation; Illegal logging; Poaching; Upper Guinea","Holbech, L.H.; Department of Animal Biology & Conservation Science, P.O.

Recent field studies have provided detailed descriptions of the carbon cycle of mature tropical forests, but logged or secondary forests have received much less attention. Here, we report the first measures of total net primary productivity (NPP) and its allocation along a disturbance gradient from old-growth forests to moderately and heavily logged forests in Malaysian Borneo. We measured the main NPP components (woody, fine root and canopy NPP) in old-growth (n = 6) and logged (n = 5) 1 ha forest plots. Overall, the total NPP did not differ between old-growth and logged forest (13.5 ± 0.5 and 15.7 ± 1.5 Mg C ha−1 year−1 respectively). However, logged forests allocated significantly higher fraction into woody NPP at the expense of the canopy NPP (42% and 48% into woody and canopy NPP, respectively, in old-growth forest vs 66% and 23% in logged forest). When controlling for local stand structure, NPP in logged forest stands was 41% higher, and woody NPP was 150% higher than in old-growth stands with similar basal area, but this was offset by structure effects (higher gap frequency and absence of large trees in logged forest). This pattern was not driven by species turnover: the average woody NPP of all species groups within logged forest (pioneers, nonpioneers, species unique to logged plots and species shared with old-growth plots) was similar. Hence, below a threshold of very heavy disturbance, logged forests can exhibit higher NPP and higher allocation to wood; such shifts in carbon cycling persist for decades after the logging event. Given that the majority of tropical forest biome has experienced some degree of logging, our results demonstrate that logging can cause substantial shifts in carbon production and allocation in tropical forests. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","allocation; carbon; Global Ecosystems Monitoring; land use; logging; net primary productivity; SAFE Project; tree census","Riutta, T.; School of Geography and the Environment, United Kingdom; email: terhi.riutta@ouce.ox.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042179199

This has led to the emergence of two metrics commonly proposed as tools for decision making: phylogenetic diversity (PD) and functional diversity (FD). Yet, the extent to which they are interchangeable remains poorly understood. We explore shifts in and relationships between FD and PD of bird communities across a disturbance gradient in Borneo, from old-growth tropical forest to oil palm plantation. We show a marked decline in PD, and an increase in phylogenetic mean nearest taxon distance from forest to oil palm, in line with declining SR across the gradient. However, phylogenetic mean pairwise distance is constrained by forest logging more than by conversion to oil palm, taking account of SR. The decline in FD across the gradient is less severe than in PD, with all metrics indicating relatively high trait diversity in oil palm despite low SR, although functional redundancy is much reduced. Accounting for SR, levels of functional over- or under-dispersion of bird communities are strongly coupled to habitat disturbance level rather than to any equivalent phylogenetic metric. Policy implications. We suggest that while phylogenetic diversity (PD) is an improvement on species richness as a proxy for functional diversity (FD), conservation decisions based on phylogenetic diversity alone cannot reliably safeguard maximal functional diversity. Thus, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity are related but still complementary. Priority setting exercises should use these metrics in combination to identify conservation targets. © 2017 The Authors.

In previous work, spaceborne single-pass InSAR phase-center height has been shown to have the capability of accurately monitoring the subtle height change due to forest growth and degradation (with meter or even sub-meter level RMSE about the regression curve fit to time). In this paper, a new approach using spaceborne SAR interferometry has been developed to detect and quantify selective logging events. In particular, a quantitative indicator of forest disturbance is first defined, namely disturbance index (DI; from 0 “no disturbance” to 1 “deforestation”). A numerical field data-based InSAR simulation is then performed to study the functional relationship between the field-measured DI and InSAR relative phase-center height change from a modeled perspective. A selective logging event (October 2015 through January 2016) over the Tapajos National Forest in Brazil is used for experimental validation. The InSAR-inverted DI estimates derived from DLR's TanDEM-X time-series data were compared with those measured from a field work over 32 quarter-hectare stands at Tapajos with relative RMSE of 30% for DI up to 0.3 and the disturbance epoch can be determined with an average accuracy of 13 days (constrained by the satellite repeat interval usually on the order of 2 weeks). As a comparison, the repeat-pass InSAR coherences from the concurrent JAXA's ALOS-2 data are shown to qualitatively correspond to the TanDEM-X results, confirming both the location and the epoch of the disturbance event. This new method is anticipated to contribute to the range of tools being developed for large-scale forest disturbance assessment and monitoring (for UN's REDD+ programme) through using spaceborne single-pass InSAR missions (e.g., DLR's TanDEM-X and in the future, TanDEM-L). © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","ALOS-2; Fire; Forest disturbance; Spaceborne InSAR; TanDEM-X; Tropical selective logging","Lei, Y.; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, United States; email: leiyangfrancis@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045252027

Here, we explore the properties of a new lidar-derived index, the large tree canopy area (LCA) defined as the area occupied by canopy above a reference height. We hypothesize that this simple measure of forest structure representing the crown area of large canopy trees could consistently explain the landscape variations in forest volume and aboveground biomass (AGB) across a range of climate and edaphic conditions. To test this hypothesis, we assembled a unique dataset of high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) and ground inventory data in nine undisturbed old-growth Neotropical forests, of which four had plots large enough (1 ha) to calibrate our model. We found that the LCA for trees greater than 27 m (∼ 25-30 m) in height and at least 100 m2 crown size in a unit area (1 ha), explains more than 75 % of total forest volume variations, irrespective of the forest biogeographic conditions. When weighted by average wood density of the stand, LCA can be used as an unbiased estimator of AGB across sites (<i>R</i>2 Combining double low line 0.78, RMSE Combining double low line 46.02 Mg haĝ'1, bias Combining double low line ĝ'0.63 Mg haĝ'1). Unlike other lidar-derived metrics with complex nonlinear relations to biomass, the relationship between LCA and AGB is linear and remains unique across forest types. A comparison with tree inventories across the study sites indicates that LCA correlates best with the crown area (or basal area) of trees with diameter greater than 50 cm. The spatial invariance of the LCA-AGB relationship across the Neotropics suggests a remarkable regularity of forest structure across the landscape and a new technique for systematic monitoring of large trees for their contribution to AGB and changes associated with selective logging, tree mortality and other types of tropical forest disturbance and dynamics. © 2018 Author(s).",,"Meyer, V.; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, United States; email: victoria.meyer@jpl.nasa.gov",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048321096

This timber harvesting is estimated to account for more than one in eight of all greenhouse gas emissions from tropical forests. Yet there is currently no means to independently estimate extracted volumes and associated greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we built upon an earlier paper that used an automated algorithm applied to LiDAR to accurately identify area of timber harvest impact in the categories of roads/decks, skid trails and gaps. This algorithm was applied to 2014 harvest areas in four concessions in Kalimantan, Indonesia. In two of these concessions, total harvested timber volumes and greenhouse gas emissions were measured and calculated in the field using data from 188 harvested and extracted trees. In order to relate remote sensing data with the estimated extracted volumes, we calculated factors that linked extracted timber volumes with greenhouse gas emissions, and applied three different regression equations. The parameters of the most accurate equation were the areas of roads, skid trails and gaps, explaining 87% of the variation in the data. For situations where rivers are used in place of roads for extracting timber and for instances of non-mechanized, often illegal logging, a second equation was created in which only skid trail and gap attribute data were used, and in this equation 86% of the variation was accounted. The final equation, intended for use in scenarios where LiDAR data are not available but moderate resolution imagery could be used, associated length of roads only with extracted volumes. In this case, 78% of the variation was explained. Application of the first equation permitted estimation of extracted volumes and associated greenhouse gas emissions from two additional logging concessions. We discuss the application of these equations to areas that have been identified as illegal logging concessions, and propose that these may be applied to larger regions across the country. These equations offer a way to estimate volumes of timber extraction when no ground data is available, and to calculate greenhouse gas emissions associated with extracted volumes, providing a simple methodology useful across forested tropical countries. © 2018 The Author(s).

In general, tropical forests have a higher leaf area index and it is a challenge to estimate LAI in a forest with a very dense canopy. In this study, it is assumed that the traditional Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-derived fractional vegetation cover (fCover) has weak relationship with leaf area index in a dense forest. We propose a partial least squares (PLS) regression model using the height percentile metrics derived from airborne LiDAR data to estimate the LAI of a dense forest. Ground inventory and airborne LiDAR data collected in a selectively logged tropical forest area in Eastern Amazonia are used to map LAI from the plot level to the landscape scale. The results indicate that the fCover, derived from the first return or the last return, has no significant correlations with the ground-based LAI. The PLS model evaluated by the leave-one-out validation shows that the estimated LAI is significantly correlated with the ground-based LAI with an R2 of 0.58 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.13. A data comparison indicates that the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) LAI underestimates the landscape-level LAI by about 22%. The MODIS quality control data show that in the selected tile, the cloud state is not the primary factor affecting the MODIS LAI performance; rather, the LAI from the main radiative transfer (RT) algorithm contributes much to the underestimation of the LAI in the tropical forest. In addition, the results show that the LiDAR-based LAI has a better response to the logging activities than the MODIS-based LAI, and that the leaf area reduction caused by logging is about 13%. In contrast, the MODIS-based LAI exhibits no apparent spatial correlation with the LiDAR-based LAI. It is suggested that the main algorithm of MODIS should be improved with regard to tropical forests. The significance of this study is the proposal of a framework to produce ground-based LAI using forest inventory data and determine the plot-level LAI at the airborne and satellite scale using LiDAR data. © 2018 by the authors.","Height percentile metrics; Leaf area index; LiDAR; MODIS; Partial least square; Tropical forest","Qu, Y.; State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, China; email: qyh@bnu.eud.cn",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048987085

Limited data on the magnitude of carbon losses and rates of carbon recovery following forest degradation have hindered carbon accounting efforts and contributed to incomplete national reporting to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). We combined annual time series of Landsat imagery and high-density airborne lidar data to characterize the variability, magnitude, and persistence of Amazon forest degradation impacts on aboveground carbon density (ACD) and canopy structure. On average, degraded forests contained 45.1% of the carbon stocks in intact forests, and differences persisted even after 15 years of regrowth. In comparison to logging, understory fires resulted in the largest and longest-lasting differences in ACD. Heterogeneity in burned forest structure varied by fire severity and frequency. Forests with a history of one, two, and three or more fires retained only 54.4%, 25.2%, and 7.6% of intact ACD, respectively, when measured after a year of regrowth. Unlike the additive impact of successive fires, selective logging before burning did not explain additional variability in modeled ACD loss and recovery of burned forests. Airborne lidar also provides quantitative measures of habitat structure that can aid the estimation of co-benefits of avoided degradation. Notably, forest carbon stocks recovered faster than attributes of canopy structure that are critical for biodiversity in tropical forests, including the abundance of tall trees. We provide the first comprehensive look-up table of emissions factors for specific degradation pathways at standard reporting intervals in the Amazon. Estimated carbon loss and recovery trajectories provide an important foundation for assessing the long-term contributions from forest degradation to regional carbon cycling and advance our understanding of the current state of frontier forests. © 2018 The Author(s).

Elephants are ecological engineers that create and maintain forest habitat; thus, their loss will have large consequences for the composition and structure of Afrotropical forests. Through a comprehensive literature review, we evaluated the roles of forest elephants in seed dispersal, nutrient recycling, and herbivory and physical damage to predict the cascading ecological effects of their population declines. Loss of seed dispersal by elephants will favor tree species dispersed abiotically and by smaller dispersal agents, and tree species composition will depend on the downstream effects of changes in elephant nutrient cycling and browsing. Loss of trampling and herbivory of seedlings and saplings will result in high tree density with release from browsing pressures. Diminished seed dispersal by elephants and high stem density are likely to reduce the recruitment of large trees and thus increase homogeneity of forest structure and decrease carbon stocks. The loss of ecological services by forest elephants likely means Central African forests will be more like Neotropical forests, from which megafauna were extirpated thousands of years ago. Without intervention, as much as 96% of Central African forests will have modified species composition and structure as elephants are compressed into remaining protected areas. Stopping elephant poaching is an urgent first step to mitigating these effects, but long-term conservation will require land-use planning that incorporates elephant habitat into forested landscapes that are being rapidly transformed by industrial agriculture and logging. © 2017 Society for Conservation Biology","bosque tropical; Central Africa; dispersión de semillas; herbivory; herbivoría; Loxodonta cyclotis; Loxodonta cyclotis; nutrient recycling tropical forest; reciclaje de nutrientes; seed dispersal; África Central","Poulsen, J.R.; Nicholas School of the Environment, P.O.

The components of RUSLE such as rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope-length and steepness (LS), cover management (C) and conservation practice (P) factors were grouped into two categories by keeping one set as temporally changing and others as static. Among them the R and C factors are calculated for the years 1991, 2001 and 2015 whereas the K and LS factors are considered for the single time frame. Because of the forested nature of the study area, the P factor is kept constant for the whole analysis. The R factor and C factor is shown changes in values and its distribution over the years, which reflected in the final soil loss and erosion vulnerability map as a change in the rate of erosion and spatial domain. The analysis of three time slices has shown that the maximum value of the soil loss per unit area i.e. at erosion hotspots, is relatively similar throughout at around 1636 to 1744 t/ha/y. This is the result of maximum values of R factor and C factor i.e. high rainfall erosivity combined with lack of vegetation cover in those hotspots, which are generally steeply sloping terrain. The reclassification of annual soil loss map into erosion vulnerability zones indicated a major increase in the spatial spread of erosion vulnerability from the year 1991 to 2015 with a significant increase in the high and critical erosion areas from 2.3% (1991) to 31.5% (2015). In 1991, over 84% of the study area was under low erosion vulnerability class but by the year 2015 only 12% was under low erosion vulnerability class. Moreover, a dynamic nature in the erosion pattern was found from the year 1991 to 2015 with more linear areas of land associated with higher rate of soil loss and enhanced erosion vulnerability. The linearity in the spatial pattern is correlated with the development of logging roads and logging activities which has been confirmed by the extraction of exposed areas from satellite images of different years of analysis. The findings of the present study has quantified the changes in vegetation cover from dense, thick tropical forest to open mixed type landscapes which provide less protection against erosion and soil loss during the severe rainfall events which are characteristic of this tropical region. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Borneo; RUSLE; Sarawak; Soil loss; Spatial-temporal; Vulnerability","Vijith, H.; Department of Applied Geology, CDT 250, Malaysia; email: vijith.hamza@curtin.edu.my",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029579155

Several studies have shown a strong correlation between logging intensity and a reduction of biodiversity, wood production, and biomass stocks. However, little is known about the long-term effects of logging on the main forest carbon (C) stocks in above and below-ground tree biomass, deadwood, litter, and soil. In this study we quantified C stocks in 28 0.25-ha plots located in a mixed Dipterocarp forest, Borneo, Indonesia, logged 16 years ago at different intensities ranging from 0 to 57% of initial biomass removed. We investigated the effect of logging intensity, topography, and soil variables on each C stock using linear mixed models. Sixteen years after logging, total C stocks ranged from 218 to 554 Mg C ha−1 with an average of 314 ± 21 Mg C ha−1, of which more than 75% were found in live trees. Logging intensity was found to be the main factor explaining the variability in carbon stored in above- and below- ground biomass of tree DBH &gt;20 cm and deadwood. Simultaneously, the proportion of deadwood increased with logging intensity reaching 13.5% of total C stocks in intensively logged plots (&gt;20% removal of initial biomass). This study confirmed, therefore, the need to limit logging intensity to a threshold of 20% of initial biomass removal in order to limit the long-term accumulation of deadwood after logging, probably due to high post-logging mortality. With more than half of all Bornean forests already logged, accounting for total C post-logging is key to better assess the long-term carbon footprint of commercial logging in the region, and is a necessary step towards the development of C-oriented forest management in the tropics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Above- and below-ground carbon; Carbon stock; Dipterocarp forests; Logged forest","Rozak, A.H.; CIRAD-ES, France; email: andes.hamuraby.rozak@lipi.go.id",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043525745

Overall, fast human-driven habitat destruction is suspected to be one of the major causes of species extinction. The mosaic of vegetation types, which contributes to the incredible diversity of the tropics is highly impacted by large-scale fragmentation. The main causes of such habitat fragmentation are selective logging for valuable timber and agricultural clearance. The knowledge of the short and long-term effects of removing selected species in the tropical rainforests are scarce and need to be further investigated. Some studies about the effects of tropical forest disturbance in the short term have been conducted, but in the long term, there is limited knowledge. In this paper, I consider a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that modelled the dynamics of tropical rainforest subject to selective logging to understand how and why weeds and vine displace and limit tree species.

Our ability to quantify these impacts is dependent on methods and tools that accurately identify the extent and features of logging activity. LiDAR-based measurements of these features offers significant promise. Here, we present a set of algorithms for automated detection and mapping of critical features associated with logging – roads/decks, skid trails, and gaps – using commercial airborne LiDAR data as input. The automated algorithm was applied to commercial LiDAR data collected over two logging concessions in Kalimantan, Indonesia in 2014. The algorithm results were compared to measurements of the logging features collected in the field soon after logging was complete. The automated algorithm-mapped road/deck and skid trail features match closely with features measured in the field, with agreement levels ranging from 69% to 99% when adjusting for GPS location error. The algorithm performed most poorly with gaps, which, by their nature, are variable due to the unpredictable impact of tree fall versus the linear and regular features directly created by mechanical means. Overall, the automated algorithm performs well and offers significant promise as a generalizable tool useful to efficiently and accurately capture the effects of selective logging, including the potential to distinguish reduced impact logging from conventional logging. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

This research fills a knowledge gap about the viability and dissimilarities of using these technologies for measuring the top of canopy structure in tropical forests. In an empirical study with data acquired in a Guyanese tropical forest, we assessed the differences between top of canopy models (TCMs) derived from TLS measurements and from UAV imagery, processed using structure from motion. Firstly, canopy gaps lead to differences in TCMs derived from TLS and UAVs. UAV TCMs overestimate canopy height in gap areas and often fail to represent smaller gaps altogether. Secondly, it was demonstrated that forest change caused by logging can be detected by both TLS and UAV TCMs, although it is better depicted by the TLS. Thirdly, this research shows that both TLS and UAV TCMs are sensitive to the small variations in sensor positions during data collection. TCMs rendered from UAV data acquired over the same area at different moments are more similar (RMSE 0.11–0.63 m for tree height, and 0.14–3.05 m for gap areas) than those rendered from TLS data (RMSE 0.21–1.21 m for trees, and 1.02–2.48 m for gaps). This study provides support for a more informed decision for choosing between TLS and UAV TCMs to assess top of canopy in a tropical forest by advancing our understanding on: (i) how these technologies capture the top of the canopy, (ii) why their ability to reproduce the same model varies over repeated surveying sessions and (iii) general considerations such as the area coverage, costs, fieldwork time and processing requirements needed. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Large forest-dwelling mammals are often highly sensitive to environmental perturbation through processes such as fragmentation, simplification of habitat structure, and abiotic changes including increased temperatures where the canopy is cleared. Whilst previous work has focused upon species richness and rarity in logged forest, few look at spatial and temporal behavioural responses to forest degradation. Using camera traps, we explored the relationships between diel activity, behavioural expression, habitat use and ambient temperature to understand how the wild free-ranging Bornean banteng (Bos javanicus lowi) respond to logging and regeneration. Three secondary forests in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo were studied, varying in the time since last logging (6–23 years). A combination of generalised linear mixed models and generalised linear models were constructed using >36,000 trap-nights. Temperature had no significant effect on activity, however it varied markedly between forests, with the period of intense heat shortening as forest regeneration increased over the years. Bantengs regulated activity, with a reduction during the wet season in the most degraded forest (z = -2.6, Std. Error = 0.13, p = 0.01), and reductions during midday hours in forest with limited regeneration, however after >20 years of regrowth, activity was more consistent throughout the day. Foraging and use of open canopy areas dominated the activity budget when regeneration was limited. As regeneration advanced, this was replaced by greater investment in travelling and using a closed canopy. Forest degradation modifies the ambient temperature, and positively influences flooding and habitat availability during the wet season. Retention of a mosaic of mature forest patches within commercial forests could minimise these effects and also provide refuge, which is key to heat dissipation and the prevention of thermal stress, whilst retention of degraded forest could provide forage. © 2018 Gardner et al.

We applied the land degradation surveillance framework (LDSF) method with a sentinel site of (10 km × 10 km) to assess carbon stock levels and tree diversity in the Marsabit Forest Reserve (MFR). The above ground (ABG) carbon stock was estimated at 12.42 t/ha, while soil organic carbon (SOC) was 12.51 t/ha, with SOC densities increasing with increasing depth. The mean ABG carbon and SOC densities were higher in the least disturbed strata than the disturbed strata. The estimated ABG carbon and SOC stocks were significantly lower than the range observed in a typical dry tropical forest. Twenty-one tree species were recorded belonging to twelve families with the disturbed areas recording nine tree species while the least disturbed recording twelve species. Rubiaceae and Rutaceae were the richest families with four species each while Boraginaceae, Capparaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Tiliaceae, Violaceae, and Ochnaceae the least frequent with one species each. The most common tree species were, Croton megalocarpus, Drypetes gerrardii, Ochna insculpta, Strychnos henningsii and Vangueria madagascariensis. The forest recorded a basal diameter of 14.09 ± 12.15 cm, basal area of 0.016 m 2/ha with a mean height of 8.69 m. The basal size class distribution declined monotonically indicative of a stable population. Livestock grazing, selective logging, and firewood collection were the primary forms of anthropogenic activities recorded in the MFR despite the moratorium imposed on consumptive utilisation of forest products by the Marsabit County security committee. The Pearson correlation coefficient returned an inverse relationship between forest disturbance with SOC and ABG carbon in the disturbed strata suggesting that anthropogenic activities reduced carbon stocks in the MFR. Concerted efforts to mitigate anthropogenic impacts on the MFR could significantly increase its terrestrial carbon sequestration potential and the provision of critical ecosystem goods and services. © 2018 The Authors","Carbon sequestration; Carbon stocks; Mt Marsabit forest; Soil organic carbon","Muhati, G.L.; Institute for Climate Change and Adaptation University of Nairobi, P.O.

Reduced-impact logging is considered best practice and third-party certification aims to ensure that strict standards are met. This includes minimizing the number of roads constructed, avoiding sensitive areas and strictly regulating hunting. Large scale camera trap grids were utilized in Guatemala and Peru to evaluate the impact of reduced-impact logging in certified concessions upon the large and medium-sized mammal fauna with special emphasis on jaguars (Panthera onca). Spatial capture-recapture models showed that jaguar density in Peru (4.54 ± 0.83 ind. 100 km−2) was significantly higher than in Guatemala (1.52 ± 0.34 ind. 100 km−2) but in both regions, densities were comparable to protected areas. Camera traps detected 22 species of large and medium sized mammals in Guatemala and 27 in Peru and a multi-species occupancy model revealed that logging had no negative impact on any of the species studied and actually had an initial positive impact on several herbivore species. We found no avoidance of logging roads; in fact, many species, especially carnivores, frequently used logging roads as movement corridors. Our results indicate that well-managed logging concessions can maintain important populations of large and medium-sized mammals including large herbivores and large carnivores as long as hunting is controlled and timber volumes extracted are low. Responsible forest management would therefore be an ideal activity in the buffer zones and multiple use zones of protected areas creating much less impact and conflict than alternatives such as agriculture or cattle ranching while still providing economic opportunities. Logging concessions can also play an important role in maintaining landscape connectivity between protected areas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Camera traps; Forest management; Madre de Dios; Maya Biosphere Reserve; Multi-species occupancy model; Petén; Reduced-impact logging; Spatial capture-recapture","Tobler, M.W.; San Diego Zoo Global, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Rd., United States; email: mtobler@sandiegozoo.org",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044771617

With long-lived animals this requires extensive, long-term data, but such data is often lacking. Here we present longitudinal data documenting changes in primate abundance over 45 years at eight sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Complex patterns of change in primate abundance were dependent on site, sampling year, and species, but all species, except blue monkeys, colonized regenerating forest, indicating that park-wide populations are increasing. At two paired sites, we found that while the primate populations in the regenerating forests had increased from nothing to a substantial size, there was little evidence of a decline in the source populations in old-growth forest, with the possible exception of mangabeys at one of the paired sites. Censuses conducted in logged forest since 1970 demonstrated that for all species, except black-and-white colobus, the encounter rate was higher in the old-growth and lightly-logged forest than in heavily-logged forest. Black-and-white colobus generally showed the opposite trend and were most common in the heavily-logged forest in all but the first year of monitoring after logging, when they were most common in the lightly-logged forest. Overall, except for blue monkey populations which are declining, primate populations in Kibale National Park are growing; in fact the endangered red colobus populations have an annual growth rate of 3%. These finding present a positive conservation message and indicate that the Uganda Wildlife Authority is being effective in managing its biodiversity; however, with constant poaching pressure and changes such as the exponential growth of elephant populations that could cause forest degradation, continued monitoring and modification of conservation plans are needed. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Logging; Population change; Population recovery; Primate conservation; Restoration","Chapman, C.A.; Department of Anthropology, Canada; email: Colin.Chapman@McGill.ca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038019573

However, the extent and impact of exotic plant invasions in modified tropical landscapes remain poorly understood. We examined whether logging drives exotic plant invasions and whether their combined influences alter understory plant community composition in lowland rain forests in Borneo. We tested the relationship between understory communities and local- and landscape-scale logging intensity, using leaf area index (LAI) and aboveground biomass (AGB) data from 192 plots across a logging-intensity gradient from primary to repeatedly logged forests. Overall, we found relatively low levels of exotic plant invasions, despite an intensive logging history. Exotic species were more speciose, had greater cover, and more biomass in sites with more local-scale canopy loss. Surprisingly, though, exotic species invasion was not related to either landscape-scale canopy loss or road configuration. Moreover, logging and invasion did not seem to be acting synergistically on native plant composition, except that seedlings of the canopy-dominant Dipterocarpaceae family were less abundant in areas with higher exotic plant biomass. Current low levels of invasion, and limited association with native understory community change, suggest there is a window of opportunity to manage invasive impacts. We caution about potential lag effects and the possibly severe negative impacts of exotic plant invasions on the long-term quality of tropical forest, particularly where agricultural plantations function as permanent seed sources for recurrent dispersal along logging roads. We therefore urge prioritization of strategic management plans to counter the growing threat of exotic plant invasions in modified tropical landscapes. © 2017 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","alien; Borneo; Clidemia hirta; dipterocarps; disturbance gradient; invasive exotic plants; propagule pressure; Sabah","Döbert, T.F.; School of Biological Sciences, 35 Stirling Highway, Australia; email: timm.dobert@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038427910

Despite pervasive changes to forest structure, selectively logged forests represent vital refugia for global biodiversity. The ability of these forests to buffer temperature-sensitive species from climate warming will be an important determinant of their future conservation value, although this topic remains largely unexplored. Thermal buffering potential is broadly determined by: (i) the difference between the “macroclimate” (climate at a local scale, m to ha) and the “microclimate” (climate at a fine-scale, mm to m, that is distinct from the macroclimate); (ii) thermal stability of microclimates (e.g. variation in daily temperatures); and (iii) the availability of microclimates to organisms. We compared these metrics in undisturbed primary forest and intensively logged forest on Borneo, using thermal images to capture cool microclimates on the surface of the forest floor, and information from dataloggers placed inside deadwood, tree holes and leaf litter. Although major differences in forest structure remained 9–12 years after repeated selective logging, we found that logging activity had very little effect on thermal buffering, in terms of macroclimate and microclimate temperatures, and the overall availability of microclimates. For 1°C warming in the macroclimate, temperature inside deadwood, tree holes and leaf litter warmed slightly more in primary forest than in logged forest, but the effect amounted to <0.1°C difference between forest types. We therefore conclude that selectively logged forests are similar to primary forests in their potential for thermal buffering, and subsequent ability to retain temperature-sensitive species under climate change. Selectively logged forests can play a crucial role in the long-term maintenance of global biodiversity. © 2017 The Authors.

The net effects of these interactions remain difficult to predict and may be affected by overhunting and habitat disturbance, two widespread threats to tropical forests. Recent studies have documented their separate effects on plant recruitment but our understanding of how defaunation and logging interact to influence tropical tree communities is limited. From 2013 to 2016, we followed the fate of marked tree seedlings (n = 1489) from 81 genera in and outside experimental plots. Our plots differentially excluded small, medium and large-bodied mammal herbivores in logged and unlogged forest in Malaysian Borneo. We assessed the effects of experimental defaunation and logging on taxonomic diversity and plant trait (wood density, specific leaf area, fruit size) composition of seedling communities. Although seedling mortality was highest in the presence of all mammal herbivores (44%), defaunation alone did not alter taxonomic diversity nor plant trait composition. However, herbivores (across all body sizes) significantly reduced mean fruit size across the seedling community over time (95% confidence interval (CI): 20.09 to 20.01), particularly in logged forest (95% CI: 20.12 to 20.003).

Here, we demonstrate how selective logging influenced dung beetle communities and two associated ecological processes – namely, dung consumption and incidental soil bioturbation – in the eastern Brazilian Amazon, using a robust before-and-after control-impact design. We tested hypotheses about logging-induced changes on environmental condition (canopy cover, leaf litter and soil texture), community metrics (e.g. dung beetle species richness and biomass) and beetle-mediated faecal-detritus processing; and on the importance of the environment for beetle communities and functional processes. We show that post-logging changes in canopy openness do not necessarily mediate logging impacts on dung beetle diversity and biomass, which were directly influenced by reduced impact logging (RIL) operations. Although neither environmental condition (leaf litter or soil sand content) nor faecal consumption and incidental soil bioturbation were directly affected by RIL, the relationships between environmental condition and biological components were. By showing that selective logging alters the linkages among belowground ecological processes and environmental drivers, we provide support that logged forests can retain some important functioning processes, in particular faecal consumption, even when the dung beetle diversity and biomass are impoverished. These results provide support for the resistance of functional processes to logging-induced changes in biodiversity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Amazon forest; Brown world; Dung beetle; Dung removal; Faecal-detritus pathway; Reduced-impact logging","França, F.; Departamento de Biologia, Brazil; email: filipeufla@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044625477

They also host edible caterpillars, Imbrasia oyemensis and Cirina forda, respectively, which are important to the nutrition and income of rural and urban populations. This study evaluated the density of these tree species within a 10 km radius around each of 4 villages and in the 2012 annual cutting areas of two timber concessions in the region of Kisangani (DRC). Sapelli and tali trees ≥20 cm dbh and their stumps were identified and measured on 21 five ha plots around each village and 20 five ha plots on each concession. Around villages and on concessions, sapelli trees occurred at densities of 0.048 ± 0.008 harvestable trees (≥80 cm dbh) ha−1 and 0.135 ± 0.019 precommercial trees ha−1. Harvestable tali trees (≥60 cm dbh) were seven times more abundant at 0.347 ± 0.032 ha−1, while precommercial tali trees occurred at densities of 0.329 ± 0.033 trees ha−1. Between 25% and 40% of the harvestable sapelli trees had been logged as compared to &lt;3% of the harvestable tali trees. Production per tree, derived from another study, was extrapolated to estimate caterpillar yields on a half circle of 15,700 ha within 10 km of villages, using these estimates of tree densities. Depending on the village, yields were estimated as 11.6–34.5 Mg year−1 of I. oyemensis from sapelli trees, and 65.8–80.9 Mg year−1 of C. forda from tali trees, an average of 0.74–2.2 kg ha−1 year and 4.2–5.2 kg ha−1 year, fresh weight, respectively (0.23–0.68 kg ha−1 year−1 and 1.3–1.6 kg ha−1 year−1, dry weight, respectively). Harvestable trees yielded more caterpillars, providing most of the C. forda caterpillars. However, because harvestable sapelli trees occurred at low densities, the bulk of I. oyemensis caterpillar production would be hosted on precommercial trees. Logging practices that reject poorly formed or hollow trees and guidelines that call for high minimum diameter limits and retention of seed trees or prohibit logging on slopes or riparian zones, safeguard edible caterpillar production. Multiple resource management for multiple stakeholders would require more deliberate planning and management approaches based on negotiations with local communities and approaches like setting aside collection zones or collection trees that would be protected from logging. © 2017 The Authors","African mahogany; Cirina forda; Forest management; Imbrasia oyemensis; NTFP; Tropical forests","Snook, L.K.; Bioversity International, Via dei Tre Denari 472/a, Maccarese, Italy; email: l.snook@cgiar.org",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039848887

Studies for mixed dipterocarp forest, the dominant tropical forest type for South and Southeast Asia, demonstrate seedlings in the existing forest understory (advance regeneration) play the most important role in forming a new forest after disturbance (e.g., logging, windstorms). Our study monitors the regeneration dynamic across a topographic gradient (ridge, mid-slope, and valley) of the understory for a mixed dipterocarp forest in the Sinharaja MAB reserve in southwest Sri Lanka. We recorded seedling recruitment, growth, and mortality by species in replicated plots on multiple forest understory sites over a ten-year period. Seedling density ranged from 26 to 31 m2 with all of it categorized as advance regeneration of canopy tree species. Results show differences in seedling density per species across the topography and over time, with differences driven by changes in species composition from valley to ridge and in recruitment periodicity potentially related to supra-annual variations in climate. Seedling mortality was higher on ridges than valley and mid-slopes; and disproportionately higher seedling mortality occurs of relatively shade-intolerant late-successional trees species (70% mortality after 8 yr) compared with their more shade-tolerant associates (30% mortality after 8 yr). Our results contradict current selective logging prescriptions for tropical forests that comprise a single cutting cycle and minimum diameter felling for all commercial timber trees. Such harvests give no consideration to timing and manipulation of the forest canopy to favor release of advance regeneration. We recommend careful timing of timber harvests to occur in synchrony to the periodicity of seedling recruitment and silvicultural treatments that both insures their release and that accommodates to differences in seedling composition and density across topography. © 2018 Ashton et al.","mixed dipterocarp forest; seedlings; selective logging; Sinharaja; Sri Lanka",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043718870

Here, we test the effects of abiotic factors (light variation, caused by logging disturbance, and soil fertility) and biotic factors (species richness and functional trait composition) on biomass stocks (above-ground biomass, fine root biomass), SOM and productivity in a relatively monodominant Guyanese tropical rainforest. This forest grows on nutrient-poor soils and has few species that contribute most to total abundance. We, therefore, expected strong effects of soil fertility and species’ traits that determine resource acquisition and conservation, but not of diversity. We evaluated 6 years of data for 30 0.4-ha plots and tested hypotheses using structural equation models. Disturbance increased productivity but decreased above-ground biomass stocks. Soil phosphorus (P) enhanced above-ground biomass and productivity, whereas soil nitrogen reduced fine root biomass. In contrast to expectations, trait values representing acquisitive strategies (e.g. high leaf nutrient concentration) increased biomass stocks, possibly because they indicate higher nutrient absorption and thus higher biomass build-up. However, under harsh conditions where biomass increase is slow, acquisitive trait values may increase respiration and vulnerability to hazards and therefore increase biomass loss. As expected, species richness did not affect productivity. We conclude that light availability (through disturbance) and soil fertility—especially P—strongly limit forest biomass productivity and stocks in this Guyanese forest. Low P availability may cause strong environmental filtering, which in turn results in a small set of dominant species. As a result, community trait composition but not species richness determines productivity and stocks of biomass and SOM in tropical forest on poor soils.

Global remote sensing based forest cover data (2000 − 2012) point to the rapid loss of tropical dry forest in South America and Africa, also, if not foremost, inside formally protected areas. Here, we significantly extend the baseline of tropical dry forest loss inside a protected area in Ghana using a generalizable change detection technique. The forest cover change detection is based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from historical Landsat data (1984–2015). Field measurements were carried out in dry semi-deciduous forest and in the adjacent savanna and woodland. Estimates of the canopy area index and above ground woody biomass were related to NDVI derived from Landsat 8 data. The change detection indicated significant NDVI decrease in a large area initially covered by tropical dry forest, associated with deforestation. The peak in deforestation was found to have occurred between 1990 and 2002, hereafter, the conservation status of the area was improved. A combination of remote sensing data corroborated by secondary data sources provides evidence for the almost complete clearance of a tropical dry forest inside a strictly protected area, attributable to logging and land clearing for arable farming. The NDVI change detection also revealed NDVI increase in the adjacent woodlands from 2002 to 2015, demonstrating woody encroachment. Historical fire data from the MODIS burned area product indicate that the deforested area experienced a high frequency of anthropogenic burning since 2004, which may have caused further degradation and largely prevents forest regeneration. The results show the ongoing destruction of tropical ecosystems even within ostensibly protected areas and ask for the revision of protection and management strategies of such areas. © 2017 The Authors",,"Janssen, T.A.J.; Department of Earth Sciences, Boelelaan 1085, Netherlands; email: t.a.j.janssen@vu.nl",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039792165

Understanding the long-term responses of tropical forests to management practices is critical for managing tropical forests sustainably. To investigate the responses of tropical forest dynamics to different silvicultural treatment intensities, permanent plots were established in 1967 in an Australian tropical forest with four treatments: selective logging only as a control and selective logging followed by three differing intensity silvicultural treatments in 1969. We investigated changes in the number of species, species dominance, and species composition of trees (DBH ≥ 10 cm) from 1967 to 2015. Before selective logging, the number of tree species did not differ between the treatments, ranging from 70 to 75. Selective logging alone had small immediate effects on the number of species and species abundance distributions. After silvicultural treatment, the number of species in the low-intensity treatment, medium-intensity treatment and high-intensity treatment were reduced to 48, 42, and 18 respectively. The number of species in the control, low-intensity, and medium-intensity treatments recovered to their pre-logging levels within 46 years, but recovery in the high-intensity treatment was incomplete due to much greater initial species loss through silvicultural treatment. Silvicultural treatments increased species dominance, with the differences being progressively more marked as the level of treatment intensity increased. Over 46 years, tree species abundance distribution in the silvicultural treatments became more even and largely returned to pre-logging conditions, with more rapid recovery after low and intermediate silvicultural treatments. Following silvicultural treatments, species composition in the logging only, low-intensity and medium-intensity silvicultural treatments did not change markedly, whereas species composition was substantially altered by high-intensity silvicultural treatment and was subsequently distinct from the other treatments. Within 46 years following treatments, species composition in the high intensity treatment showed a recovery trajectory towards pre-logging conditions, leading to increased species compositional similarity among the four treatments. Increasing the intensity of silviculture treatment led to greater time required for recovery of species diversity, composition and compositional similarity. We recommend that high-intensity silvicultural treatments should be avoided if rapid recovery of species diversity and composition is the desired management outcome in tropical rainforests similar to those in our study area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity conservation; Compositional similarity; Forest recovery; Regenerating forests; Species diversity; Thinning","Hu, J.; School of Agriculture and Food Sciences, Australia; email: jing.hu1@uq.net.au",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037536947

Studies have shown that various lidar-derived metrics can be used to predict forest attributes, such as aboveground biomass. However, finding out which metric works best at which scale and under which conditions requires extensive field inventories as ground-truth data. The goal of our study was to overcome the limitations of inventory data by complementing field-derived data with virtual forest stands from a dynamic forest model. The simulated stands were used to compare 29 different lidar metrics for their utility as predictors of tropical forest biomass at different spatial scales. We used the process-based forest model FORMIND, developed a lidar simulation model, based on the Beer-Lambert law of light extinction, and applied it to a tropical forest in Panama. Simulation scenarios comprised undisturbed primary forests and stands exposed to logging and fire disturbance regimes, resulting in mosaics of different successional stages, totaling 3.7 million trees on 4200 ha. The simulated forest was sampled with the lidar model. Several lidar metrics, in particular height metrics, showed good correlations with forest biomass, even for disturbed forest. Estimation errors (nRMSE) increased with decreasing spatial scale from < 10% (200-m scale) to > 30% (20-m scale) for the best metrics. At the often used 1-ha scale, the top-of-canopy height obtained from canopy height models with fine to relatively coarse pixel resolutions (1 to 10 m) yielded the most accurate biomass predictions, with nRMSE < 6% for undisturbed and nRMSE < 9% for disturbed forests. This study represents the first time dynamic modeling of a tropical forest has been combined with lidar remote sensing to systematically investigate lidar-to-biomass relationships for varying lidar metrics, scales and disturbance states. In the future, this approach can be used to explore the potential of remote sensing of other forest attributes, e.g., carbon dynamics, and other remote sensing systems, e.g., spaceborne lidar and radar. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Aboveground biomass; Disturbance; Forest modeling; Lidar simulation; Resolution; Scale; Tropical forest","Knapp, N.; Department of Ecological Modeling, Germany; email: nikolai.knapp@ufz.de",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035788879

Deforestation is directly linked to species extinction, loss of ecosystem functions, increased CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases, and changes in the structure and quality of aquatic ecosystem biotopes. Deforestation not only reduces the forest area but also changes the landscape configuration. Fragmentation increases the isolation of habitats and increases the edge effect. One of the main environmental problems of Nicaragua at this time is deforestation and fragmentation of forest stands. This problem is caused by an uncontrollable expansion of extensive livestock farming, unsustainable agriculture and population growth. The reason is that the Nicaraguan economy is directly dependent on agriculture and cattle farming. Another reason is the impact of climate change, when the entire Central American region is affected by a 3-year period of extreme drought caused by the climate phenomenon of El Niño. Last but not least, the share of illegal logging is also contributing to deforestation. Between 1990 and 2000, Nicaragua lost an average of 99,900 hectares of forest per year, which stand for a loss of 1,53% per year. Overall, between 1990 and 2005, Nicaragua lost 20.6% of the forest area or around 1 349 000 hectares. © 2018 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

We investigate long-term differences in species richness, diversity, relative abundance and community evenness within a regenerating rainforest previously subjected to two different but common types of human disturbance: selective logging and clear-felling for agriculture. Even after a 30 year recovery period, and despite close-proximity to protected primary forest that provided favourable recolonization potential, species richness and diversity of amphibians, butterflies, understorey birds and nocturnal birds were all lower in post-agriculture secondary forest, compared to regenerating selectively logged forest; in contrast, mammals showed no significant difference. Species richness in secondary forest was on average 18 ± 6.7% lower, and diversity was 13 ± 7.6% lower than in the selectively logged forest. Community evenness and relative abundances also displayed differences related to historic human disturbance type. However, the measured difference in species richness (18%) between selectively logged and secondary forest was 60% smaller than previous indirect comparisons based on young areas of regenerating forests have suggested. We find that human-induced differences in tropical biodiversity are long lasting but also suggest that even historically highly disturbed regenerating tropical forests could, with appropriate management, provide important opportunities for conserving tropical forest biodiversity. © 2018","Anthropogenic; Degraded forest; Disturbance; Logging; Multi-taxa; Secondary forest","Whitworth, A.; Institute of Biodiversity, United Kingdom; email: andy.w.whitworth@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041406564

In the present study of a tree species-rich and old-growth Ecuadorian Neotropical forest, we assessed the spatial distribution of gaps and gap size in relation to: i) tree number at the gap edge, ii) number of tree species at the gap edge, iii) number of tree species per stem at the gap edge, iv) species similarity, v) species evenness at the gap edge, vi) size differentiation at the gap edge, vii) gap isolation and viii) species mingling at the gap edge. Our results demonstrated that the spatial distribution of gaps was random. Various gap attributes were strongly associated with gap size. The number of tree species per stem at the gap edge was negatively correlated to the gap size. Gap sizes up to 50 m2 were mostly sufficient to generate tree species-rich forest stands. Assuming that our results were representative for an old-growth neotropical rainforest in Ecuador, our study remarks the following management recommendations: 1) Rainforests have a very complex spatial and diversity structure and logging activities should preferably be omitted because of adverse effects. 2) If logging is inevitable, this should mimic a random choice of trees and tree species, to prevent special selection of tree dimension and species; and a random distribution of trees to be logged, to produce gaps smaller than 50 m2 and never larger than 400 m2. Additionally, we suggest cutting not more than 5 % of the tree biomass per 10-20 years period, to preclude stronger alterations of ecosystem processes, and the reduction of existing dead wood from the ecosystem. © 2018, Universidad de Costa Rica.

Scattered forest matrices resulted in forest edge areas, which will considerably affect the forest biotic and abiotic conditions, as well as forest tree dynamics within the edge sites. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of forest edge on perimeter of the forest fragment on the forest biomass stock, growth, tree basal area as well as species composition, richness and abundance in a degraded peatland forest in West Kalimantan. A twelve-ha forest was divided into 35 plots in the interior forest and 13 at the forest edge; each plot was 50 m by 50 m in size based on their abiotic conditions such as light and temperatures. Leaf Area Index (LAI) was measured in each plot of both forest edge and interior sites using Licor-2100. The results indicated that even though the biomass levels maintained relatively moderate to high levels on both sites, forest edge significantly lowered forest biomass by 32%, reduced 23-25% of tree-biomass growth per unit area for both tree diameter of 10-20 cm and >20 cm. There was a shift of tree species composition, 76 species were found on both sites, 24 species were not found in edge site, but present in the interior site and 10 species were found only in edge site. Peatland forest matrix created forest edges that are lowering peatland forest roles in sequestering carbon per unit area and reducing species diversity.

The ability to detect a full range of impacts is essential to understanding how biodiversity responds to human disturbance. Since monitoring the entire biodiversity of a tropical forest is an impossible task, specific groups of biodiversity are often used as biological indicators. Due to their relative ease in detection and identification, their sensitivity to environmental change and their short generation time, butterflies are suggested to be one of the most effective biodiversity indicators for tropical forest monitoring. However, most biodiversity monitoring of tropical ecosystems using butterflies relies only on one sub-group, the fruit-feeding butterflies, or Nymphalidae. Here we assess for the first time if the use of carrion-feeding butterfly communities might improve our ability to detect and monitor human impacts and conservation management outcomes in tropical forests. We analysed species richness, abundance and community composition of rainforest fruit and carrion butterfly communities to see how effectively they detect known differences in forest disturbance history, between three different vertical strata of rainforest, and assess whether they provide stable results across different seasons. We found that compared to fruit-feeding butterflies, sampling carrion-feeders detected greater species richness and abundance for the same survey effort, detected more pronounced effects of known differences in historic disturbance, and showed greater temporal stability in biodiversity patterns across the year. We also identify for the first time a series of indicator butterfly species and tribes that could be used as biological indicators to study biodiversity responses to human disturbance and differences across vertical strata of the rainforest. We therefore suggest that carrion-feeding butterfly communities will be a powerful addition to the family of indicators groups that are available for monitoring the impacts of human disturbance on tropical biodiversity. © 2017",,"Whitworth, A.; Institute of Biodiversity, United Kingdom; email: Andy.Whitworth@glasgow.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035113082

We include impacts of variable deforestation risk (secure land tenure or not) and alternative harvesting practices (certified reduced-impact logging methods or not). We find that low-intensity selective logging offers both the best and the worst overall outcomes per unit wood produced, depending on whether certified reduced-impact logging methods are used and whether land tenure is secure. Medium-to-high-intensity natural forest harvests and conversion to high-yield plantations generate intermediate outcomes. Deforestation risk had the strongest influence on overall outcomes.

However, tropical montane forests have been studied less than tropical lowland forests, and their role in carbon storage is not well understood. Montane forests are highly endangered due to logging, land-use and climate change. Our objective was to analyse how the carbon balance changes during forest succession. Methods: In this study, we used a method to estimate local carbon balances that combined forest inventory data with process-based forest models. We utilised such a forest model to study the carbon balance of a tropical montane forest in South Ecuador, comparing two topographical slope positions (ravines and lower slopes vs upper slopes and ridges). Results: The simulation results showed that the forest acts as a carbon sink with a maximum net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of 9.3 Mg C∙(ha∙yr)−1 during its early successional stage (0–100 years). In the late successional stage, the simulated NEE fluctuated around zero and had a variation of 0.77 Mg C∙(ha∙yr) –1. The simulated variability of the NEE was within the range of the field data. We discovered several forest attributes (e.g., basal area or the relative amount of pioneer trees) that can serve as predictors for NEE for young forest stands (0–100 years) but not for those in the late successional stage (500–1,000 years). In case of young forest stands these correlations are high, especially between stand basal area and NEE. Conclusion: In this study, we used an Ecuadorian study site as an example of how to successfully link a forest model with forest inventory data, for estimating stem-diameter distributions, biomass and aboveground net primary productivity. To conclude, this study shows that process-based forest models can be used to investigate the carbon balance of tropical montane forests. With this model it is possible to find hidden relationships between forest attributes and forest carbon fluxes. These relationships promote a better understanding of the role of tropical montane forests in the context of global carbon cycle, which in future will become more relevant to a society under global change. © 2017, The Author(s).","Carbon balance; Forest model; Forest productivity; Forest succession; FORMIND; Tropical montane forest","Fischer, R.; Department of Ecological Modelling, Permoserstr, 15, Germany; email: rico.fischer@ufz.de",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041863303

For logging companies, REDD+ projects provide the opportunity to compensate a voluntary reduction of the logging intensity by valuing the associated carbon gain. We explored, from the perspective of a logging company, a range of scenarios for reducing logging intensity so as to assess the possibilities for emissions reductions and to evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects. On the basis of Monte Carlo simulations for a typical export-oriented forest concession, we calculated intervals of break-even prices of permanent carbon credits. We show that logging intensity reduction is an attractive option when there is a complete cessation of logging, and for little exploited and low-profit forests. The most feasible IFM projects would be those that require a major reduction of logging intensity. Our work suggests that—instead of improving forest logging techniques—IFM projects based on a voluntary reduction of logging intensity would rather lead the exclusive choice of carbon or timber valuation. Carbon market prices are too low to be an incentive to change logging practices toward more climate-smart forest management, and a change of paradigm to change actors’ behaviors would be needed. © 2017 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umeå","Concession; Congo Basin; Improved forest management; Logging; REDD+; Tropical forests","Rossi, V.; RU Forests and Societies, Cameroon; email: vivien.rossi@cirad.fr",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033468381

As such, it is critically important to identify at which spatial scale logging intensity should be measured and whether there are clear thresholds in the relationship between logging intensity and its impacts on biodiversity or ecological processes. We address this using a robust before-and–after logging experimental design in the Brazilian Amazon, using a gradient of logging intensity measured at two different spatial scales. We assessed the impacts of selective logging using dung beetle communities and their ecological functions of dung removal and soil bioturbation. Our findings provide novel empirical evidence that biological consequences from Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) depend strongly on the scale at which logging intensity is measured: dung beetle local species richness and composition were strongly associated with logging intensity measured at a 10 ha scale, while dung beetle-mediated soil bioturbation was more strongly associated with logging intensity measured across 90 ha. Contrary to expectations, we found concave-shaped relationships between logging intensity and biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, demonstrating that sensitive dung beetle species and important processes may be lost following even low intensity anthropogenic forest disturbances. Taken together, these results suggest that production forests in the tropics need to reconsider the scale at which logging intensity is regulated, and put in place measures that further incentivise land sparing to enhance biodiversity conservation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Brazilian Amazon; Land-sparing; Selective logging intensity; Threshold; Tropical forest","França, F.M.; Lancaster Environment Centre, United Kingdom; email: f.machadofranca@lancaster.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032684910

Frequent burning and grazing are required to maintain the savanna vegetation structure. However, in conservation areas, fire suppression is promoted to avoid wildfires; whereas domestic livestock grazing is considered a strong interfering factor for tree establishment, due to trampling and browsing. In tropical forests which were converted to savannas, competitive exotic grasses have often replaced the native grasses. Where exotic grasses are present, aboveground biomass accumulation and thus man-induced fire risk are high and potentially undermine tree recruitment. On the long-term, the savanna state may shift into a grass-dominated state with little tree cover, generating unfavorable conditions from a livelihood perspective. We examined this problem in a human-induced pine savanna in the La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico. Smallholder farmers highly valued this savanna for both livestock production and resin extraction from the fire resistant pine Pinus oocarpa. However, fire suppression and the presence of exotic grasses are reducing the tree recruitment. The main research question was to what degree can cattle grazing replace fire in its role of biomass removal and thereby stimulate pine recruitment and maintain the desired savanna state. We determined current savanna extension in the region and interviewed farmers to reconstruct past savannazation processes and expansion of exotic grasses. We related adult species-specific tree density to the herbaceous-grass cover, and pine and oak seedling and sapling densities to understory vegetation cover, canopy closure, and cattle grazing history. Finally, a field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of livestock grazing on survival and growth of planted pine saplings. The savanna currently covers 20% of the study site; it is the result of past slash-and-burn agriculture and selective logging, which have favored the expansion of several exotic grass species. In savannas where exotic grasses are abundant, sapling density was lower compared to sites with a native grass cover. While livestock grazing seemed to increase pine seedling density likely as a consequence of reduced grass cover, pine sapling survival however, was significantly reduced by livestock trampling. By seeking a balance between the livestock's benefits and adverse effects on pine recruitment, farmers may develop an integrated management system adapted to their specific biotic rangeland conditions. It should allow forage production, while controlling the negative effects of exotic grasses on pine recruitment, thus maintaining a productive pine savanna system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Exotic grasses; Induced pine savanna; Landscape trap; Livestock grazing; Resin extraction; Small-holder farmers","Braasch, M.; El Colegio de la Frontera Sur (ECOSUR), Carretera Panamericana y Periférico Sur s/n Barrio María Auxiliadora, Mexico; email: marcobraasch@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031733802

To determine the extent to which financial constraints justify the reluctance of Indonesian forest industries to intensify their silviculture at operational scales, we develop a series of scenarios to compare the financial viability of enrichment planting along cleared lines through twice logged forest (TPTJ) with the common practice of selective logging alone (TPTI). Because TPTJ also increases carbon stocks relative to the logged-only option, we consider carbon payments in some scenarios. With a discount rate of 6% and a cutting cycle of 30 years, TPTJ yields higher net present values (NPVs) than TPTI (US$442 vs $145/ha, respectively). TPTJ still provides higher NPVs than TPTI with discount rates up to 8% and cutting cycles of 25–30 years.

Fruit characteristics and shade tolerance regimes of 269 tree species were compiled. Stem densities of tree species producing fruits of various sizes and having different shade tolerance regimes were computed for Mabira and compared with densities of conspecifics in Budongo, a less disturbed forest with similar floral composition. Seventy per cent of tree species in Mabira are animal-dispersed, of which 10% are large-fruited light demanders. These species are the most vulnerable because they rarely recruit beneath adult conspecifics and are exclusively dispersed by large vertebrates, also vulnerable in heavily disturbed forests. Comparison of densities between Mabira and Budongo showed that large-fruited light demanders had a lower density in Mabira. Other categories of tree species had similar densities in both forests. It is plausible that the low density of large-fruited light demanders is due to limited recruitment caused by dispersal limitations. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","fruit/seed size; light demanders; logging; seed dispersal; shade tolerants","Ssekuubwa, E.; Department of Forestry, P.O.

Selective logging is a pressing land use with potential for considerable impacts on plant–soil interactions, litter decomposition, and nutrient cycling. Here, in Borneo's tropical rainforests, we test the hypothesis that decomposition is driven by litter quality and that there is a significant “home-field advantage,” that is positive interaction between local litter quality and land use. We determined mass loss of leaf litter, collected from selectively logged and old-growth forest, in a fully factorial experimental design, using meshes that either allowed or precluded access by mesofauna. We measured leaf litter chemical composition before and after the experiment. Key soil chemical and biological properties and microclimatic conditions were measured as land-use descriptors. We found that despite substantial differences in litter quality, the main driver of decomposition was land-use type. Whilst inclusion of mesofauna accelerated decomposition, their effect was independent of land use and litter quality. Decomposition of all litters was slower in selectively logged forest than in old-growth forest. However, there was significantly greater loss of nutrients from litter, especially phosphorus, in selectively logged forest. The analyses of several covariates detected minor microclimatic differences between land-use types but no alterations in soil chemical properties or free-living microbial composition. These results demonstrate that selective logging can significantly reduce litter decomposition in tropical rainforest with no evidence of a home-field advantage. We show that loss of key limiting nutrients from litter (P & N) is greater in selectively logged forest. Overall, the findings hint at subtle differences in microclimate overriding litter quality that result in reduced decomposition rates in selectively logged forests and potentially affect biogeochemical nutrient cycling in the long term. © 2017 The Authors.

Industrial-scale forest degradation and conversion are increasing fire occurrence, and interactions with climate anomalies such as El Niño induced droughts can magnify the extent and severity of fire activity. The influences of these factors on fire frequency in tropical forests has not been widely studied at large spatio-temporal scales at which feedbacks between fire reoccurrence and forest degradation may develop. Linkages between fire activity, industrial land use, and El Niño rainfall deficits are acute in Borneo, where the greatest tropical fire events in recorded history have apparently occurred in recent decades. Here we investigate how fire frequency in Borneo has been influenced by industrial-scale agricultural development and logging during El Niño periods by integrating long-term satellite observations between 1982 and 2010 – a period encompassing the onset, development, and consolidation of its Borneo's industrial forestry and agricultural operations as well as the full diversity of El Niño events. We record changes in fire frequency over this period by deriving the longest and most comprehensive spatio-temporal record of fire activity across Borneo using AVHRR Global Area Coverage (GAC) satellite data. Monthly fire frequency was derived from these data and modelled at 0.04° resolution via a random-forest model, which explained 56% of the monthly variation as a function of oil palm and timber plantation extent and proximity, logging intensity and proximity, human settlement, climate, forest and peatland condition, and time, observed using Landsat and similar satellite data. Oil-palm extent increased fire frequency until covering 20% of a grid cell, signalling the significant influence of early stages of plantation establishment. Heighted fire frequency was particularly acute within 10 km of oil palm, where both expanding plantation and smallholder agriculture are believed to be contributing factors. Fire frequency increased abruptly and dramatically when rainfall fell below 200 mm month−1, especially as landscape perturbation increased (indicated by vegetation index data). Logging intensity had a negligible influence on fire frequency, including on peatlands, suggesting a more complex response of logged forest to burning than appreciated. Over time, the epicentres of high-frequency fires expanded from East Kalimantan (1980's) to Central and West Kalimantan (1990's), coincidentally but apparently slightly preceding oil-palm expansion, and high-frequency fires then waned in East Kalimantan and occurred only in Central and West Kalimantan (2000's). After accounting for land-cover changes and climate, our model under-estimates observed fire frequency during ca. 1990–2002 and over-estimates it thereafter, suggesting that a multi-decadal shift to industrial forest conversion and forest landscapes may have diminished the propensity for high-frequency fires in much of this globally significant tropical region since ca. 2000. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Deforestation; Degradation; El Niño; Fire; Logging; Oil palm","Sloan, S.; Center for Tropical Environmental Sustainability Science, P.O.

We examined response ratios for 637 comparisons between disturbed forests and adjacent ‘pseudo-control’ forests with a history of little or no impact. This revealed an overall decrease of 30% (95% CI: 17–43%) in biodiversity metrics in response to habitat disturbance, which was particularly detrimental to primate assemblages in Madagascar and Southeast Asia. This effect was more severe in areas converted to agriculture (77%; 95% CI: 59–88%), while land use intensification led to far more detrimental effects than the initial degradation of forests, calling for the identification of habitat degradation thresholds. Negative effects of forest degradation were further exacerbated by ~ 30% under scenarios of persistent hunting pressure, emphasizing possible synergistic interactions between environmental stressors. Given that overall primate diversity was depressed in degraded habitats, our results emphasize the importance of retaining connectivity across remnants of undisturbed primary forest within human-modified landscapes to maintain full complements of primate species, and ensure their long-term persistence. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Deforestation; Habitat degradation; Logging; Threat; Tropics","Almeida-Rocha, J.M.D.; UESC, Rodovia Ilhéus-Itabuna, km 16, Pavilhão Max de Menezes, Sala A1, Brazil; email: almeidarocha.jm@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032976768

It is challenging to map tropical forests and their spatio-temporal changes because forests are facing fragmentation from human activities (e.g., logging, deforestation), drought, and fire, as well as persistent clouds. Here we present a robust approach to map forests in South America during 2007–2010 and analyze the consistency and uncertainty among eight major forest maps in South America. Greenness-relevant MOD13Q1 NDVI and structure/biomass-relevant ALOS PALSAR time series data recorded 2007 through 2010 were coupled to identify and map forests at 50-m spatial resolution. Both area and spatial comparison were conducted to analyze the consistency and uncertainty of these eight forest maps. Annual 50-m PALSAR/MODIS forest maps were generated during 2007–2010 and the total forest area in South America was about 8.63 × 106 km2 in 2010. Large differences in total forest area (8.2 × 106 km2–12.7 × 106 km2) existed among these forest products, especially in the forest edges, semi-humid tropical, and subtropical regions. Forest products generated under a similar forest definition had similar or even larger variation than those generated with contrasting forest definitions. We also find out that one needs to consider leaf area index as an adjusting factor and use much higher threshold values in the Vegetation Continuous Field (VCF) datasets to estimate forest cover areas. Analyses of PALSAR/MODIS forest maps in 2008/2009 showed a relatively small rate of loss (3.2 × 104 km2 year− 1) in net forest cover, similar to that of FAO FRA (3.3 × 104 km2 year− 1), but much higher annual rates of forest loss and gain. The rate of forest loss (0.195 × 106 km2 year− 1) was higher than that of Global Forest Watch (0.081 × 106 km2 year− 1). PALSAR/MODIS forest maps showed that more deforestation occurred in the unfragmented forest areas. Caution should be used when using the different forest maps to analyze forest loss and make policies regarding forest ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation.

The mixing ratio of two distinct functional groups (i.e., indicator genera for mature and disturbed forests) could be an alternative to the previous index that requires the identification of all species/genera. However, tree taxa indicative of logging intensity in a wide geographic range have not fully been determined. In this study, we conducted a large-scale vegetation survey in six forest management units (FMUs) spanning geographically distinct regions of Borneo (East Kalimantan in Indonesia, and Sarawak and Sabah in Malaysia) to detect a set of common indicator genera for logging intensity. A total of fifty 20-m radius plots were established in forests with a wide range of disturbance regimes in each FMU. A cluster analysis that was applied to all data combining the six FMUs identified two main vegetation types; one was the mature forest (with greater above-ground biomass, AGB) and the other was the disturbed forest (with lower AGB). Subsequently, 92 genera were derived as indicators for the mature forest by an indicator analysis, whereas 8 genera were derived for the disturbed forest. The mixing ratios of the two indicator groups per plot [(densities of mature-forest indicators – densities of disturbed-forest indicators)/densities of all trees] significantly correlated with another index of forest degradation (i.e., remaining AGB). When the number of indicator genera was greatly reduced by removing all genera other than those of Dipterocapaceae for the mature-forest indicators and Macaranga and Neolamarkia for the disturbed-forest indicators, the mixing ratios of indicator groups still significantly correlated with the index of forest degradation (remaining AGB). Because the two indicator groups with a minimal number of genera can be easily identified by local foresters, we conclude that the mixing ratio is a robust and practical index for the responses of tree communities to logging disturbances in Bornean tropical production forests. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity index; Floristic analysis; Forest certification; Indicator taxa analysis; REDD+; Tree community composition","Aoyagi, R.; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Apartado 0843-03092, Balboa, Panama; email: aoyagi.ryota@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027497991

However, biodiversity decline due to deforestation and forest degradation of tropical forest is increasing at an alarming rate. Biodiversity dynamics due to natural and anthropogenic disturbances are mainly monitored using established field survey approaches. However, such approaches appear to fall short at addressing complex disturbance factors and responses. We argue that the integration of state-of-the-art monitoring approaches can improve the detection of subtle biodiversity disturbances and responses in changing tropical forests, which are often data-poor. We assess the state-of-the-art technologies used to monitor biodiversity dynamics of changing tropical forests, and how their potential integration can increase the detail and accuracy of biodiversity monitoring. Moreover, the relevance of these biodiversity monitoring techniques in support of the UNCBD Aichi targets was explored using the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) as a framework. Our review indicates that although established field surveys were generally the dominant monitoring systems employed, the temporal trend of monitoring approaches indicates the increasing application of remote sensing and in -situ sensors in detecting disturbances related to agricultural activities, logging, hunting and infrastructure. The relevance of new technologies (i.e., remote sensing, in situ sensors, and DNA barcoding) in operationalising EBVs (especially towards the ecosystem structure, ecosystem function, and species population classes) and the Aichi targets has been assessed. Remote sensing application is limited for EBV classes such as genetic composition and species traits but was found most suitable for ecosystem structure class. The complementarity of remote sensing and emerging technologies were shown in relation to EBV candidates such as species distribution, net primary productivity, and habitat structure. We also developed a framework based on the primary biodiversity attributes, which indicated the potential of integration between monitoring approaches. In situ sensors are suitable to help measure biodiversity composition, while approaches based on remote sensing are powerful for addressing structural and functional biodiversity attributes. We conclude that, synergy between the recent biodiversity monitoring approaches is important and possible. However, testing the suitability of monitoring methods across scales, integrating heterogeneous monitoring technologies, setting up metadata standards, and making interpolation and/or extrapolation from observation at different scales is still required to design a robust biodiversity monitoring system that can contribute to effective conservation measures. © 2017 by the authors.","Biodiversity monitoring; Disturbances; DNA barcoding; In situ sensors; Remote sensing; Tropical forests","Mulatu, K.A.; Laboratory of Geo-Information Science and Remote Sensing, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, Netherlands; email: kalkidan.mulatu@wur.nl",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032878391

However, trade-offs still exist between lidar pulse density and accuracy of AGB estimates. We assessed the impacts of lidar pulse density on the estimation of AGB stocks and changes using airborne lidar and field plot data in a selectively logged tropical forest located near Paragominas, Pará, Brazil. Field-derived AGB was computed at 85 square 50 × 50 m plots in 2014. Lidar data were acquired in 2012 and 2014, and for each dataset the pulse density was subsampled from its original density of 13.8 and 37.5 pulses·m-2 to lower densities of 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4 and 0.2 pulses·m-2. For each pulse density dataset, a power-law model was developed to estimate AGB stocks from lidar-derived mean height and corresponding changes between the years 2012 and 2014. We found that AGB change estimates at the plot level were only slightly affected by pulse density. However, at the landscape level we observed differences in estimated AGB change of &gt; 20 Mg·ha-1 when pulse density decreased from 12 to 0.2 pulses·m-2. The effects of pulse density were more pronounced in areas of steep slope, especially when the digital terrain models (DTMs) used in the lidar derived forest height were created from reduced pulse density data. In particular, when the DTM from high pulse density in 2014 was used to derive the forest height from both years, the effects on forest height and the estimated AGB stock and changes did not exceed 20 Mg·ha-1. The results suggest that AGB change can be monitored in selective logging in tropical forests with reasonable accuracy and low cost with low pulse density lidar surveys if a baseline high-quality DTM is available from at least one lidar survey. We recommend the results of this study to be considered in developing projects and national level MRV systems for REDD+ emission reduction programs for tropical forests. © 2017 by the authors.","Biomass change; Humid tropical forest; Lidar; MRV; Pulse density","Silva, C.A.; NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory, United States; email: carlos_engflorestal@outlook.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032864768

An incomplete understanding of seed predation makes it difficult to predict how widespread extirpations of vertebrate granivores in tropical forests might affect tree communities, especially in the face of habitat disturbance. Many tropical forests are simultaneously affected by animal loss as well as habitat disturbance, but the consequences of each for forest regeneration are often studied separately or additively, and usually on a single plant demographic stage. The combined impacts of these threats could affect plant recruitment in ways that are not apparent when studied in isolation. We used wire cages to exclude large (elephants), medium, (sambar deer, bearded pigs, muntjac deer), and small (porcupines, chevrotains) ground-dwelling mammalian granivores and herbivores in logged and unlogged forests in Malaysian Borneo. We assessed the interaction between habitat disturbance (selective logging) and experimental defaunation on seed survival, germination, and seedling establishment in five dominant dipterocarp tree species spanning a 21-fold gradient in seed size. Granivore-induced seed mortality was consistently higher in logged forest. Germination of unpredated seeds was reduced in logged forest and in the absence of small to large-bodied mammals. Experimental defaunation increased germination and reduced seed removal but had little effect on seed survival. Seedling recruitment however, was more likely where logging and animal loss occurred together. The interacting effects of logging and hunting could therefore, actually increase seedling establishment, suggesting that the loss of mammals in disturbed forest could have important consequences for forest regeneration and composition. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","Borneo; defaunation; granivore; logging; plant recruitment; plant-herbivore interactions; seedling; tropical forest","Granados, A.; Department of Zoology, Canada; email: granados@zoology.ubc.ca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030176542

Several certification schemes exist to ensure more sustainable exploitation and large areas of production forests are currently certified. Under such schemes, logging companies are required to evaluate whether species are not overexploited and, if necessary, adapt their logging activities. However, the data needed to project exploitation intensities – growth, mortality and regeneration rates of trees – are scarce or non-existent. Tree-ring analysis provides lifetime species-specific growth data that can be used to allow or improve the projections of timber availability during following logging cycles. In this study, we integrated growth data from tree rings with logging inventory data to forecast timber yields in the next harvest round for four timber species in Cameroon. We compared projections using tree-ring data with projections using fixed growth rates, as set by law and customarily applied in Cameroon. Additionally, we assessed the effect of increasing logging cycles and of using filed-based species-specific logging intensities on the next cycle's yield projections. Under current logging practices, timber volumes available at next logging cycles are projected to be 21–36% of the volumes obtained at first harvest. Simulations using fixed rates often resulted in lower yields with lower volume ingrowth from trees that were below minimum cutting diameters in the first harvest. Lengthening the logging cycle increased yield predictions during the next harvests, but yields were still not sustained over time. This problem can be resolved by using species-specific logging intensities, which led to projected yields of up to 73% of the initial harvested volume. The growth data provided by tree-ring analysis allows conducting such species-specific projections and thus helps to provide the knowledge base necessary for sustainable forest management. Yet, the low overall yields are a concern to forest conservation, as loss of economic value may lead to conversion of forests to other land uses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Future crop trees; Growth projections; Logging cycle; Minimum logging diameter; Sustainable forest management; Timber volume","Groenendijk, P.; Department of Plant Biology, P.O.

A comparative analysis of the LMG and a Regional Code of Practice for reducedimpact forest harvesting was also conducted. The results of this study suggest that the implementation of RIL measures in Bobiri is sporadic due to barriers in the flow of information among stakeholders and to the lack of technical training for field staff of logging companies.

Despite the resulting degradation of forest structure, selectively logged forests still harbor a substantial amount of biodiversity leading to suggestions that their protection is the next best alternative to conserving primary, old-growth forests. Restoring carbon stocks under Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) schemes is a potential method for obtaining funding to protect logged forests, via enrichment planting and liberation cutting of vines. This study investigates the impacts of restoring logged forests in Borneo on avian phylogenetic diversity, the total evolutionary history shared across all species within a community, and on functional diversity, with important implications for the protection of evolutionarily unique species and the provision of many ecosystem services. Overall and understorey avifaunal communities were studied using point count and mist netting surveys, respectively. Restoration caused a significant loss in phylogenetic diversity and MPD (mean pairwise distance) leaving an overall bird community of less total evolutionary history and more closely related species compared to unlogged forests, while the understorey bird community had MNTD (mean nearest taxon distance) that returned toward the lower levels found in a primary forest, indicating more closely related species pairs. The overall bird community experienced a significant loss of functional strategies and species with more specialized traits in restored forests compared to that of unlogged forests, which led to functional clustering in the community. Restoration also led to a reduction in functional richness and thus niches occupied in the understorey bird community compared to unlogged forests. While there are additional benefits of restoration for forest regeneration, carbon sequestration, future timber harvests, and potentially reduced threat of forest conversion, this must be weighed against the apparent loss of phylogenetic and functional diversity from unlogged forest levels, making the biodiversity-friendliness of carbon sequestration schemes questionable under future REDD+ agreements. To reduce perverse biodiversity outcomes, it is important to focus restoration only on the most degraded areas or at reduced intensity where breaks between regimes are incorporated. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","biodiversity; birds; Liana cutting; payments for ecosystem services; REDD+; restoration; selective logging; silviculture; Southeast Asia; sustainable forest management",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028586717

Rarely have these effects been considered in terms of their impact on the functional and phylogenetic diversity of understorey plant communities, despite the direct relevance to community reassembly trajectories. Here, we test the effects of logging on functional traits and evolutionary relatedness, over and above effects that can be explained by changes in species richness alone. We hypothesised that strong environmental filtering will result in more clustered (under-dispersed) functional and phylogenetic structures within communities as logging intensity increases. We surveyed understorey plant communities at 180 locations across a logging intensity gradient from primary to repeatedly logged tropical lowland rain forest in Sabah, Malaysia. For the 691 recorded plant taxa, we generated a phylogeny to assess plot-level phylogenetic relatedness. We quantified 10 plant traits known to respond to disturbance and affect ecosystem functioning, and tested the influence of logging on functional and phylogenetic structure. We found no significant effect of forest canopy loss or road configuration on species richness. By contrast, both functional dispersion and phylogenetic dispersion (net relatedness index) showed strong gradients from clustered towards more randomly assembled communities at higher logging intensity, independent of variation in species richness. Moreover, there was a significant nonlinear shift in the trait dispersion relationship above a logging intensity threshold of c. 65% canopy loss (±17% CL). All functional traits showed significant phylogenetic signals, suggesting broad concordance between functional and phylogenetic dispersion, at least below the logging intensity threshold. Synthesis. We found a strong logging signal in the functional and phylogenetic structure of understorey plant communities, over and above species richness, but this effect was opposite to that predicted. Logging increased, rather than decreased, functional and phylogenetic dispersion in understorey plant communities. This effect was particularly pronounced for functional response traits, which directly link disturbance with plant community reassembly. Our study provides novel insights into the way logging affects understorey plant communities in tropical rain forest and highlights the importance of trait-based approaches to improve our understanding of the broad range of logging-associated impacts. © 2017 The Authors.

Logging is one of the main drivers of road construction in tropical forests. We evaluated forest fragmentation and impacts of logging roads on forest resilience and wildlife, considering the full life cycle of logging roads. Through an extensive evidence review we found that for logging road construction, corridors between 3 and 66 m (median 20 m) width are cleared, leading to a loss of 0.6–8.0 percent (median 1.7%) of forest cover. More severe impacts are increased fire incidence, soil erosion, landslides, and sediment accumulation in streams. Once opened, logging roads potentially allow continued access to the forest interior, which can lead to biological invasions, increased hunting pressure, and proliferation of swidden agriculture. Some roads, initially built for logging, become converted to permanent, public roads with subsequent in-migration and conversion of forest to agriculture. Most logging roads, however, are abandoned to vegetation recovery. Given the far-reaching impacts of the roads that become conduits for human access, its control after the end of logging operations is crucial.

Ground-dwelling and arboreal ants, and several forest-structure descriptors were sampled in nine paired areas located in control (unlogged) and logged areas in 2005, 2007 and 2009. None of the forest structure predictors were related with either the treatment or the time since logging. However, some ant assemblage’ descriptors were related with logging activities. Arboreal and ground-dwelling ant species richness was similar between unlogged and logged areas, but more ground-dwelling ant species were found in areas logged in 2005 compared with areas logged in 2009. Ground-dwelling ant assemblage composition differed between treatments (logged and unlogged) and year of logging, but species composition heterogeneity was similar between areas. Arboreal ant assemblage composition was not related with treatment and year of logging, but assemblage composition was more heterogeneous in managed areas, suggesting that species that forage on the understory vegetation may be more resilient than ground-dwelling species. The general results of functional group approach suggest that changes of species composition between control and managed areas are more related with differences in ant species occurrence than ant species richness. Selective logging had limited effect on both vegetation descriptors and ant assemblage structure, suggesting that the conciliation of impact reduction techniques with low intensity extraction seems a promising alternative for sustainable logging activity in tropical forests. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Conservation; Formicidae; Logging; Reduced impact; Tropical forest","Miranda, P.N.; Centro de Ciências Biológicas e da Natureza, BR 364 – Km 4 – Distrito Industrial, Brazil; email: patricia.miranda@ifac.edu.br",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019932974

Selecting only trees with diameters >50 cm for logging can reduce the density of reproductive trees, thereby affecting pollen dispersal and influencing the mating system among remaining trees. We evaluated the effect of logging rotations on the mating system, gene flow and genetic diversity in populations of Shorea parvifolia in primary forest, and in first and second rotation forest. Our results revealed that multiple (or at least two) selective logging events with a 30-year logging rotation had a significant impact on the genetic diversity of pollen clouds. However, the average pollen dispersal distance did not differ significantly among the multiple selective logging rotations. The multiple rotations reduced the outcrossing rate and the number effective of pollen donors in the logged forest. Moreover, the number of pollen donors in a plot was affected by the basal area of reproductive trees present. These results suggest that reducing the number of reproductive trees by logging with multiple rotations might increase the bi-parental inbreeding rate due to the reduction in density of reproductive trees in a selectively logged forest. We conclude that multiple rotations with a 30-year cycle of selective logging as currently practiced would reduce the density of reproductive trees, and would not be sustainable in terms of maintaining genetic diversity in tropical forests of Southeast Asia. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Genetic diversity; Outcrossing rate; Rotation; Selective logging; Shorea parvifolia","Tsumura, Y.; Faculty of Life & Environmental Sciences, Tsukuba, Japan; email: tsumura.yoshihiko.ke@u.tsukuba.ac.jp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024482226

However, conservation of these areas is challenging due to increasing human threats, including encroachment of agriculture and settlements, overgrazing of livestock, and selective logging. We examined the effects of forest disturbances on birds, and highlights the potential conservation value of unprotected tropical montane forests for birds in the dry evergreen Afromontane forests of the Bale Mountains, Ethiopia. We sampled birds across 2 yr in both protected forests (characterized by low levels of cultivation, overgrazing, and logging) and unprotected forests (higher levels of disturbance). Using functional traits of birds related to habitat type, diet, and foraging stratum, we characterized the differences between protected and unprotected forests in terms of avian species richness, abundance, and assemblage composition. Overall, species richness was 27% higher and bird abundance was 19% higher in unprotected forests. In contrast, species richness and abundance of forest specialists and canopy foragers were significantly higher in protected forests. These findings suggest that unprotected, disturbed tropical montane forests in Ethiopia help to achieve conservation aims in an area recognized for its global biodiversity importance. At the same time, intact forest ecosystems need continued protection to maximize functional heterogeneity associated with specialist tropical forest taxa. © 2017 Cooper Ornithological Society.","Afromontane forest; avian guilds; avifaunal diversity; Bale Mountains; forest specialists; patch size; protected area","Asefa, A.; DST-NRF Centre of Excellence, South Africa; email: addisu.asefa@yahoo.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020508548

The aim of this study was to evaluate the structure and population dynamics of Copaifera in unmanaged and managed stands by reduced-impact logging (RIL) in eastern Amazon in Pará state, Brazil. Based on a stem map of the study area, 40 Copaifera trees were randomly selected, where an equal number of trees were selected in managed and unmanaged stands. A transect of 10 × 100 m was centered at each tree (50 m each side) to assess Copaifera regeneration. Transects were subdivided into ten plots, of which six were systematically chosen to assess the height, diameter and number of Copaifera seedlings and saplings. The field assessment occurred in 2011 and 2013. To estimate the amount of sunlight transmitted to the forest floor, we computed canopy cover from airborne LiDAR data. According to the results, the abundance of Copaifera seedlings/saplings was higher in managed than unmanaged stands. About 5% of Copaifera regeneration was found between 45-50 m from the Copaifera tree while ~73% of regeneration was concentrated within a 10 m radius of the Copaifera tree. We verified that the diameter distribution of Copaifera regeneration was not a negative exponential distribution, as is typical of most tree species in natural forest. Rather, the Copaifera regeneration had a spatially aggregated distribution. In this short-term analysis, the impact of timber management is not negatively affecting the population structure or dynamics of Copaifera regeneration. © 2017 by the authors.","Forest dynamics; Lidar remote sensing; Natural regeneration; Reduced-impact logging; Tropical forest","Klauberg, C.; US Forest Service (USDA), 1221 South Main Street, United States; email: klauberg@hotmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026228657

Here we focus on the model's approach to prediction of the magnitude and duration of silvicultural treatment effects on growth of the residual trees that will contribute most of the timber available to the next planned harvest in 25–40 years. Data from 30 1-ha permanent sample plots monitored for up to 20 years in dipterocarp forest in Kalimantan, Indonesia were used to develop the model. The treatments were different logging intensities with or without post-logging silvicultural treatments. Each species was assigned to one of five groups based on their ecological traits and the merchantability of their timber. A mixed-effects model was used to account for the spatially and temporally autocorrelated permanent plot data. The mixed-effects approach improved model performance substantially compared to a fixed-effects approach; specification of the variance function and correlation structure of the error term further improved model fit. Patterns and rates of tree diameter increment varied substantially, as indicated by the large differences among species groups in terms of the level of random-effects, number of parameters assigned as mixed-effects, and the covariates that define the best model. Similarly, silvicultural treatment effects also varied among species groups, as indicated by differences in the treatment dummy variables in the final model. Among-treatment differences diminished over time. We also found that species group representation is effected differentially by the silvicultural treatments.

Hunting-induced defaunation can disrupt these interactions, altering tree recruitment, forest structure, and carbon storage, with strong effects at the seed and seedling stages. Research to date has largely focused on how changes to prominent interactions (especially seed dispersal) affect plant species and communities, while concurrent disruptions to less-studied processes may have opposing effects. With a particularly limited understanding of non-trophic interactions – such as physical damage to seedlings by vertebrate trampling, rooting, and digging – it remains difficult to predict the outcomes of defaunation for tropical forest plant communities. We established 1800 artificial seedlings in 18 intact and disturbed sites across the three main tropical forest regions – the Neotropics (Peru), the Afrotropics (Gabon) and the Indo-Malayan tropics (Malaysian Borneo) – to isolate non-trophic vertebrate physical damage from other causes of seedling mortality (herbivory, pathogens, abiotic desiccation, etc.), and to understand its effects in intact and anthropogenically-disturbed forests. We found that vertebrate physical damage is a consistent force in forests across the tropics, and that hunting significantly alters its strength, with a ∼70% decrease in damage in hunted vs. intact sites that resulted in a ∼3.5-fold (350%) increase in artificial seedling survival. Our results reveal an understudied mechanism that may contribute to changes in seedling survival, stem density, and plant community composition in tropical forests subjected to hunting. © 2017 The Authors","Defaunation; Hunting; Logging; Plant–animal interactions; Trampling; Tropical forest","Rosin, C.; Nicholas School of the Environment, United States; email: cooper.rosin@duke.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021668964

Short Communication: Effects of felling intensity on Hymenoptera biodiversity in a natural production forest in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 18: xxxx. Hymenoptera is one of the major components of insect biodiversity, where its abundance and diversity contributes to the functioning of the forest ecosystem. Most of the tropical forest in Kalimantan island has been logging since 1970. Tree felling is the initial step of logging activity. This activity leads to change Hymenoptera diversity. This study analyzes the effects of felling intensity on the Hymenoptera diversity in 100 ha area in a natural production forest in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. In this study, the diversity, evenness, and species richness index of Hymenoptera was compared before and after felling in three intensities (low, moderate, and high). Insects were collected in 9 purposively located 0.5 ha plots using a malaise trap. Three malaise traps were set in each plot The results showed that the timber felling tends to decrease the abundance of Hymenoptera. Diversity and species richness of Hymenoptera will decline in moderate and high felling intensity, whereas evenness index of Hymenoptera unchanged at three felling intensities. The composition of morphospecies of Hymenoptera was changed after tree felling with high intensity. The results of the study suggest that minimizing the felling intensity may reduce disruption of insect habitat in natural production forest in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. © 2017, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Landscape-scale conservation strategies that include these forests are expected to have substantial benefits for biodiversity, especially for large mammals and birds that require extensive habitat but that are susceptible to extirpation due to synergies between logging and hunting. In addition, their responses to logging alone are poorly understood due to their cryptic behavior and low densities. In this study, we assessed the effects of logging and hunting on detection and occupancy rates of large vertebrates in a multiple-use forest on the Guiana Shield. Our study site was certified as being responsibly managed for timber production and indigenous communities are legally guaranteed use-rights to the forest. We coupled camera-trap data for wildlife detection with a spatially explicit dataset on indigenous hunting. A multi-species occupancy model found a weak positive effect of logging on occupancy and detection rates, while hunting had a weak negative effect. Model predictions of species richness were also higher in logged forest sites compared to unlogged forest sites. Density estimates for jaguars and ocelots in our multiple-use area were similar to estimates reported for fully protected areas. Involvement of local communities in forest management, control of forest access, and nesting production forests in a landscape that includes protected areas seemed important for these positive biodiversity outcomes.

The identification of priority areas for conservation is crucial for land use planning to ensure the protection of biodiversity and ecological function. Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs), as defined by Greenpeace and World Resources Institute (WRI), are areas of the forest ecosystems not subjected to human activities. They have been identified by mapping human disturbances through remote sensing. Contrary to similar global-scale concepts, IFLs have been integrated into the standards of the certification body Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and therefore have practical implications for forest management policies. The Motion 65, approved in the general assembly of FSC in 2014, mandates the protection of IFLs located in FSC certified logging concessions. Until the implementation of national standards, forestry operations are banished from 80% of the IFL area within each forest management unit. To trace the history and evaluate the suitability of IFLs in the Central African context, we searched for documents related to the IFL method, and related approaches focusing on the identification of areas devoid of human disturbances. The IFL method is simple and cost-effective and allows for a global assessment of the influence of human infrastructures and industrial exploitation on forests. However, the method does not consider the situation below the canopy and those forest components not visible by satellites. For example, hunting, one of the main threats faced by wildlife in Central African forests today, cannot be detected with satellite imagery. On the other hand, other anthropogenic activities which remote sensing may detect may be compatible with forest ecosystem conservation. To better tailor the IFL approach to Central African forests, we recommend (i) the consideration of wildlife communities in the intactness analysis, (ii) a thorough evaluation of the impacts of human activities on forest ecosystems, and (iii) the integration of local stakeholders and governments in the design of land management strategies to respond to social, economic and environmental needs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Central Africa; Conservation; Forest management policy; Intact Forest Landscapes","Haurez, B.; Central African Forest, Passage des Déportés 2, Belgium; email: barbara.haurez@ulg.ac.be",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017036469

Because of its high economic value, illegal logging and overexploitation is threatening this species in several locations in Indonesia. In this study, in order to conserve genetic resources, we investigated the genetic structure of E. zwageri in Indonesia using chloroplast DNA sequencing. Eusideroxylon zwageri samples were collected from the Kalimantan (56 trees from seven populations) and Sumatra (16 trees from two populations) islands of Indonesia. Approximately 3137 bp of chloroplast DNA was sequenced for each tree. Twenty-one haplotypes were identified, of which six haplotypes were detected from two or three populations, whereas the other 15 haplotypes were detected from one population each. For each population, one to six haplotypes were detected, and phylogenetically closer haplotypes were detected within the same population. Although the haplotypes were roughly divided into two groups, geographically-close populations did not always have phylogenetically-close haplotypes. Our results suggest that in Indonesia, E. zwageri showed a high genetic diversity at the chloroplast DNA level, and populations within a population were derived from similar maternal lineages. Therefore, transplantation within a population may be a feasible option for E. zwageri conservation.

Habitat deterioration may also negatively affect the physiology and health of wildlife species, which may eventually lead to a higher susceptibility to infectious agents and/or increased shedding of the pathogens causing EIDs. Bats are known to host viruses closely related to important EIDs. Here, we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation, whether habitat disturbance influences the occurrence of astro- and coronaviruses in eight bat species. In contrast to our hypothesis, anthropogenic habitat disturbance was not associated with corona- and astrovirus detection rates in fecal samples. However, we found that bats infected with either astro- or coronaviruses were likely to be coinfected with the respective other virus. Additionally, we identified two more risk factors influencing astrovirus shedding. First, the detection rate of astroviruses was higher at the beginning of the rainy compared to the dry season. Second, there was a trend that individuals with a poor body condition had a higher probability of shedding astroviruses in their feces. The identification of risk factors for increased viral shedding that may potentially result in increased interspecies transmission is important to prevent viral spillovers from bats to other animals, including humans. © 2017, EcoHealth Alliance.","Astroviruses; Bats; Coinfection; Coronaviruses; Habitat fragmentation; Human-modified landscapes","Seltmann, A.; Department of Evolutionary Ecology, Alfred-Kowalke-Str. 17, Germany; email: Seltmann@izw-berlin.de",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019203425

In Southeast Asia, rainforest streams are particularly threatened by logging and conversion to oil palm, but we lack information on the impacts of this on freshwater environmental conditions, and the relative importance of catchment versus riparian-scale disturbance. We studied 16 streams in Sabah, Borneo, including old-growth forest, logged forest, and oil palm sites. We assessed forest quality in riparian zones and across the whole catchment and compared it with stream environmental conditions including water quality, structural complexity, and organic inputs. We found that streams with the highest riparian forest quality were nearly 4 °C cooler, over 20 cm deeper, had over 40% less sand, greater canopy cover, more stored leaf litter, and wider channels than oil palm streams with the lowest riparian forest quality. Other variables were significantly related to catchment-scale forest quality, with streams in the highest quality forest catchments having 40% more bedrock and 20 times more dead wood, along with higher phosphorus, and lower nitrate-N levels compared to streams with the lowest catchment-scale forest quality. Although riparian buffer strips went some way to protecting waterways, they did not maintain fully forest-like stream conditions. In addition, logged forest streams still showed signs of disturbance 10–15 years after selective logging. Our results suggest that maintenance and restoration of buffer strips can help to protect healthy freshwater ecosystems but logging practices and catchment-scale forest management also need to be considered.

Deforestation is still ongoing, however, due to illegal and/or legal logging and slash-burn agriculture, and as a result, savannazation is widely occurring. Because deforestation affects soil conditions, it is important to understand the effects of vegetation on soil nutrient dynamics in order to implement sustainable land management practices and support future afforestation. In this chapter, I explain and discuss the different nutrient stocks and flows in forest and savanna oxisols in Central Africa, based on field surveys and experiments in East Cameroon. First, I describe the difference in soil nutrient stocks between the forest and savanna: Soil C stock is mostly the same, but the soil carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio is substantially smaller in forest than in savanna, indicating N-rich conditions in forest. There is also lower soil K stock in forest, indicating that K deficiency could be one of the limiting factors for afforestation. Second, I describe the difference in soil nutrient flow between forest and savanna in relation to soil microbes. There is a significant positive correlation between soil moisture and microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) in forest, indicating the importance of organic P mineralization for MBP, whereas in savanna, there is a significant positive correlation between soil N availability and MBP, indicating N limitation for MBP. These results suggest that forest is an N-rich and P-limited ecosystem, whereas savanna is an N-limited ecosystem. © 2017.

We compared these habitats on the basis soil (physical) characteristics, canopy cover, and floristic composition. For areas one and four years after logging, we supplemented the ground-based information with aerial LiDAR data. By eight years post-logging the size class distributions of tree regeneration in all habitat types resembled those in unlogged areas, and densities were only lower in crown gaps. Eight years after logging, relative densities of pioneer trees were highest on secondary roads and log landings; no among habitat differences were observed in the relative densities of non-pioneer species at any time along the chronosequence. Tree species diversity (Fisher's alpha) converged on unlogged values on skid trails, bole gaps, and crown gaps at 8-years post-logging, but values remained lower on secondary roads and log landings. Canopy openness was greatest one year after logging, especially in log landings (mean 45.4 ± SE 4.5%) whereas four and eight years post-logging it did not exceed 10% and no differences were found among habitats. Soil bulk density was elevated relative to un-logged areas only on log landings one and four years after logging, and this difference disappeared by eight years post-logging.

Here we focus on recovery of aboveground carbon and timber stocks over the first 32 years after selective logging with the CELOS Harvest System in Suriname. Our data are from twelve 1-ha permanent sample plots in which growth, survival, and recruitment of trees ≥15 cm diameter were monitored between 1978 and 2012. We evaluate plot-level changes in basal area, stem density, aboveground carbon, and timber stock in response to average timber harvests of 15, 23, and 46 m3 ha−1. We use a linear mixed-effects model in a Bayesian framework to quantify recovery time for aboveground carbon and timber stock, as well as annualized increments for both. Our statistical models accounted for the uncertainty associated with the height and biomass allometries used to estimate aboveground carbon and increased precision of annualized aboveground carbon increments by including data from forty-one plots located elsewhere on the Guiana Shield. The probabilities of aboveground carbon recovery to pre-logging levels 32 years after harvests of 15, 23 and 46 m3 ha−1 were 45%, 40%, and 24%, respectively. Net aboveground carbon increment for logged forests across all harvest intensities was 0.64 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, more than twice the rate observed in unlogged forests (0.26 Mg C ha−1 yr−1). The probabilities of timber stock recovery at the end of the 32-year period were highest after harvest intensities of 15 and 23 m3 ha−1 (with 80% probability) and lowest after the harvest of 46 m3 ha−1 (with 70% probability). Timber stock recovery across all harvest intensities was driven primarily by residual tree growth. Application of the legal cutting limit of 25 m3 ha−1 will require more than 70 and 40 years to recover aboveground carbon and timber stocks, respectively, with 90% probability. Based on the low recruitment rates of the twelve species harvested, the 25 year cutting cycle currently implemented in Suriname is too short for long-term timber stock sustainability. We highlight the value of propagating uncertainty from individual tree measurements to statistical predictions of carbon stock recovery. Ultimately, our study reveals the trade-offs that must be made between timber and carbon services as well as the opportunity to use carbon payments to enable longer cutting rotations to capture carbon from forest regrowth. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Allometric models; Cutting cycles; REDD+; Reduced-impact logging; Sustainable forest management; Timber stocks","Roopsind, A.; Department of Biology, Gainesville, United States; email: aroopsind@ufl.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013250241

We studied seedling mortality in a rainforest in Uganda where natural recovery has failed after selective logging carried out 40 years earlier and the sites are dominated by herbaceous vegetation. We established an experiment where seeds of 12 indigenous tree species were sown into different-sized logging gaps in order to capture factors that cause early seedling mortality. We examined whether seedling mortality was influenced by vegetation cover (VC), vertebrate herbivores (VHs), gap size, or forest compartment and recorded causes of mortality. We found that seedling mortality was in general high but showed high tree species-specific variation (ranging from 19 to 92% six months after emergence). VHs, particularly rodents, were the most important cause of mortality. Rotting caused mortality particularly in smaller gaps, but elephant trampling, drying, being washed away by rain and falling debris were only minor mortality causes.

Silvicultural treatments beyond reduced-impact logging are often recommended to increase timber stocking, tree growth, and profits. Despite lack of large-scale and long-term scientific support, Indonesia has embarked on large-scale silvicultural intensification. To fill this information gap, we assessed the timber, carbon, and tree species composition consequences of different silvicultural practices in dipterocarp forests in Kalimantan, Indonesia. With data from 30 1-ha sample plots monitored for up to 20 years after silvicultural intervention coupled with a new forest growth and yield model simulation (SILFOR), we evaluated the long–term consequences of the following silvicultural practices: once logged with a minimum cutting diameter (MCD) of 60 cm (L60); once logged followed by under-planting with seedlings of commercial timber species (L60UP); twice logged with MCDs of 60 cm and then 40 cm (L60L40); and, twice logged followed by strip planting along cleared lines (L60L40SP). The results indicate that timber yields will not be sustained by L60 or L60L40 even if cutting cycles are extended from the current minimum of 30 years to 60 years. In contrast, yields from enrichment planted logged-over forests will recover to levels higher than the first cut if cutting cycles are extended to 50 years for L60UP and to 40 years for L60L40SP. Under these intensive silvicultural regimes, biomass carbon stocks also recover to primary forests levels, but with increased representation of commercial species. Although silviculturally successful, the financial consequences of these approaches to management intensification remain to be scrutinized. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Enrichment planting; Forest dynamics; Forest recovery; Managed tropical forest; Selective logging; SILFOR","Ruslandi; Department of Biology, United States; email: ruslandi_rsl@yahoo.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012284443

Such accumulated beach organic material (ABOM) has the potential to exert important negative effects on the reproductive success of marine turtles. Females must be able to exit the ocean and cross sandy beaches to nest and, as no parental care is provided, hatchlings must cross the beach to reach the sea following emergence from the nest. We investigated how ABOM affects nest site selection and hatchling dispersal at a globally important rookery for leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea in Colombia. Detailed surveys were combined with field experiments in which the amount of ABOM was manipulated. Areas with higher ABOM had a similar rate of nesting, but females spent significantly more time in nest camouflage, suffered external lesions and nested closer to the shoreline, increasing the risk of egg mortality caused by flooding and erosion. When ABOM was manually removed from several beach sectors, nest site selection moved towards areas with less risk of flooding or tidal erosion. In nesting seasons with higher ABOM, a lower rate of female recapture was experienced, suggesting a greater dispersion of nests, possibly emigration. ABOM represents a barrier for many hatchlings, causing them to spend significantly more time reaching the sea, thereby increasing their energy output and their risk of predation or desiccation. © Inter-Research 2017 www.int-res.com.","Behaviour; Conservation; Debris; Deforestation; Dermochelys coriacea; Driftwood; Nesting; Pollution; Sea turtle","Marco, A.; Doñana Biological Station, Av.

Implementing programs to reduce emissions from tropical forest loss in Southeast Asia are perceived to be expensive due to high opportunity costs of avoided deforestation. However, these costs are not representative of all REDD+ opportunities as they are typically based on average costs across large land areas and are primarily for reducing deforestation from oil palm or pulp concessions. As mitigation costs and carbon benefits can vary according to site characteristics, spatially-explicit information should be used to assess cost-effectiveness and to guide the allocation of scarce REDD+ resources. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of the following REDD+ strategies in Indonesia, one of the world's largest sources of carbon emissions from deforestation: halting additional deforestation in protected areas, timber and oil palm concessions, reforesting degraded land and employing reduced-impact logging techniques in logging concessions. We discover that when spatial variation in costs and benefits is considered, low-cost options emerged even for the two most expensive strategies: protecting forests from conversion to oil palm and timber plantations. To achieve a low emissions reduction target of 25%, we suggest funding should target deforestation in protected areas, and oil palm and timber concessions to maximize emissions reductions at the lowest cumulative cost. Low-cost opportunities for reducing emissions from oil palm are where concessions have been granted on deep peat deposits or unproductive land. To achieve a high emissions reduction target of 75%, funding is allocated across all strategies, emphasizing that no single strategy can reduce emissions cost-effectively across all of Indonesia. These findings demonstrate that by using a spatially-targeted approach to identify high priority locations for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, REDD+ resources can be allocated cost-effectively across Indonesia. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","carbon; forests; Indonesia; prioritize; REDD+; spatial; targets","Graham, V.; College of Marine and Environmental Sciences, Australia; email: victoria.graham@my.jcu.edu.au",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018462555

Our results provide unbiased forest loss area estimates, which confirm the reduction of primary forest clearing (deforestation) documented by official maps. By the end of the study period, nonprimary forest clearing, together with primary forest degradation within the BLA, became comparable in area to deforestation, accounting for an estimated 53% of gross tree cover loss area and 26 to 35% of gross aboveground carbon loss. The main type of tree cover loss in all forest types was agroindustrial clearing for pasture (63% of total loss area), followed by small-scale forest clearing (12%) and agroindustrial clearing for cropland (9%), with natural woodlands being directly converted into croplands more often than primary forests. Fire accounted for 9% of the 2000–2013 primary forest disturbance area, with peak disturbances corresponding to droughts in 2005, 2007, and 2010.

However the variance in secondary tropical forest biomass for a given stand age and climate is high and our understanding of why is limited. We constructed a model of terrestrial C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling to examine the influence of disturbance and management practices on nutrient limitation and biomass recovery in secondary tropical forests. The model predicted that N limited the rate of forest recovery in the first few decades following harvest, but that this limitation switched to P approximately 30-40 yr after abandonment, consistent with field data on N and P cycling from secondary tropical forest chronosequences. Simulated biomass recovery agreed well with field data of biomass accumulation following harvest (R2 = 0.80). Model results showed that if all biomass remained on site following a severe disturbance such as blowdown, regrowth approached pre-disturbance biomass in 80-90 yr, and recovery was faster following smaller disturbances such as selective logging. Field data from regrowth on abandoned pastures were consistent with simulated losses of nutrients in soil organic matter, particularly P. Following any forest disturbance that involved the removal of nutrients (i.e., except blowdown), forest regrowth produced reduced biomass relative to the initial state as a result of nutrient loss through harvest, leaching and/or sequestration by secondary minerals. Differences in nutrient availability accounted for 49-94% of the variance in secondary forest biomass C at a given stand age. Management lessons from this study are the importance of strategies that help retain nutrients on site, recognizing the role of coarse woody debris in immobilization and subsequent release of nutrients, and the potential for nutrient additions to enhance biomass growth and recovery in secondary tropical forests. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","Amazon; biomass; disturbance; land use; nutrients; tropical secondary forest",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017171807

Abstract: One of the main challenges in the sustained management of natural tropical forests is obtaining reliable data on tree growth, which is prerequisite information for determining harvesting volumes and felling cycles. In this study, we apply growth models based on tree-ring data and allometric equations to estimate site-specific management options for timber resources of the commercial species Calophyllum brasiliense (Calophyllaceae) comparing 16 wetland sites across different Brazilian ecoregions, the Amazon, Cerrado (savannah), Pantanal and Mata Atlântica (Coastal Atlantic Rainforest). By modeling diameter, height, and volume growth parameters, we estimate site-specific minimum logging diameters (MLD) and felling cycles analyzing a total of 341 trees. Between ecoregions, the mean diameter increments varied slightly between 4.3 ± 1.6 mm year−1 in the Amazon region (average of six sites), 4.0 ± 0.8 mm year−1 in the Cerrado and Pantanal (average of seven sites), and 4.5 ± 1.2 mm year−1 in the Mata Atlântica (average of three sites). However, between sites, we observed significant differences in diameter and volume increment rates, resulting in felling cycles varying from 14 to 63 years and MLDs in the range of 35–81 cm. This clearly indicates that forest management practices in Brazil, which generally applies a feeling cycle of 25 years and a diameter-cutting limit of 50 cm cannot guarantee a sustainable timber harvest. Timber resource management of this species requires site-specific criteria and should be restricted at sites with a low wood productivity.

With deforestation and degradation taking place throughout the tropics, improved understanding of the magnitude and spatial variation in deadwood is vital for the development of regional and global carbon budgets. However, this potentially important carbon pool is poorly quantified in Afrotropical forests and the regional drivers of deadwood stocks are unknown. In the first large-scale study of deadwood in Central Africa, we quantified stocks in 47 forest sites across Gabon and evaluated the effects of disturbance (logging), forest structure variables (live AGB, wood density, abundance of large trees), and abiotic variables (temperature, precipitation, seasonality). Average deadwood stocks (measured as necromass, the biomass of deadwood) were 65 Mg ha−1 or 23% of live AGB. Deadwood stocks varied spatially with disturbance and forest structure, but not abiotic variables. Deadwood stocks increased significantly with logging (+38 Mg ha−1) and the abundance of large trees (+2.4 Mg ha−1 for every tree &gt;60 cm dbh). Gabon holds 0.74 Pg C, or 21% of total aboveground carbon in deadwood, a threefold increase over previous estimates. Importantly, deadwood densities in Gabon are comparable to those in the Neotropics and respond similarly to logging, but represent a lower proportion of live AGB (median of 18% in Gabon compared to 26% in the Neotropics). In forest carbon accounting, necromass is often assumed to be a constant proportion (9%) of biomass, but in humid tropical forests this ratio varies from 2% in undisturbed forest to 300% in logged forest. Because logging significantly increases the deadwood carbon pool, estimates of tropical forest carbon should at a minimum use different ratios for logged (mean of 30%) and unlogged forests (mean of 18%). © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aboveground biomass (AGB); carbon storage; coarse woody debris (CWD); deadwood; necromass; tropical forest","Poulsen, J.R.; Nicholas School of the Environment, PO Box 90328, United States; email: john.poulsen@duke.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991407941

This is a critical issue to be addressed in the context of policy discussions to implement REDD+. This work reviews current scientific knowledge about the temporal dynamics of degradation-induced carbon emissions to describe common patterns of emissions from logging and fire across tropical forest regions. Using best available information, we: (i) develop short-term emissions factors (per area) for logging and fire degradation scenarios in tropical forests; and (ii) describe the temporal pattern of degradation emissions and recovery trajectory post logging and fire disturbance. Results: Average emissions from aboveground biomass were 19.9 MgC/ha for logging and 46.0 MgC/ha for fire disturbance, with an average period of study of 3.22 and 2.15 years post-disturbance, respectively. Longer-term studies of post-logging forest recovery suggest that biomass accumulates to pre-disturbance levels within a few decades. Very few studies exist on longer-term (>10 years) effects of fire disturbance in tropical rainforests, and recovery patterns over time are unknown. Conclusions: This review will aid in understanding whether degradation emissions are a substantial component of country-level emissions portfolios, or whether these emissions would be offset by forest recovery and regeneration. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"Andrade, R.B.; University of Colorado-Boulder, United States; email: rb.andrade@ymail.com",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014817270

The Amazon basin contains the largest rainforest on Earth, almost 5.8 million km2, and occupies about 40% of South America; more than 60% of the basin is located in Brazil and the rest in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. Over the past decade the positive role of tropical rainforests in capturing large amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has been demonstrated. In response to the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, tropical forests act as a global carbon sink. Main body: Accumulation of carbon in the tropical terrestrial biosphere strongly contributes to slowing the rate of increase of CO2 into the atmosphere, thus resulting in the reduction of greenhouse gas effect. Tropical rainforests have been estimated to account for 32-36% of terrestrial Net Primary Productivity (NPP) that is the difference between total forest photosynthesis and plant respiration. Tropical rainforests have been acting as a strong carbon sink in this way for decades. However, over the past years, increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, and especially CO2, in the atmosphere have significantly affected the net carbon balance of tropical rainforests, and have warmed the planet substantially driving climate changes through more severe and prolonged heat waves, variability in temperature, increased air pollution, forest fires, droughts, and floods. The role of tropical forests in mitigating climate change is therefore critical. Over the past 30 years almost 600,000 km2 have been deforested in Brazil alone due to the rapid development of Amazonia, this is the reason why currently the region is one of the 'hotspots' of global environmental change on the planet. Conclusion: Deforestation represents the second largest anthropogenic source of CO2 to the atmosphere, after fossil fuel combustion. There are many causes of deforestation, including socioeconomic and natural factors, such as clear-cutting for agriculture, ranching and development, unsustainable logging for timber, as well as droughts, fires and degradation due to climate change. About natural causes of forest degradation, in the context of the Amazon, the major agent of change in the forest ecosystem would most likely be decreased dry-season precipitation. Of the 23 global climate models employed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their 2007 report, 50-70% predict a substantial (above 20%) reduction of dry-season rainfall in eastern Amazonia under mid-range greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, 40% in central Amazonia and 20% in the west. While annual carbon emissions from fossil-fuel combustion have been continually increasing since 1960s, historical trends of deforestation and associated carbon emissions have remained poorly understood. © 2017 The Author(s).","Air pollution and respiratory diseases; Anthropogenic emissions of CO2; Bronchial asthma; Climate change; Deforestation and climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Interaction between climate change and allergy; Respiratory allergy","D'Amato, G.; Division of Respiratory and Allergic Diseases, Italy; email: gdamatomail@gmail.com",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014521437

We compared a high-intensity land-use area, where the forest that had been cleared, and used for subsistence agriculture before being abandoned in 1934 then regrew to a low-intensity land-use area, in which there had been only some selective experimental logging by the USDA Forest Service in the 1940s. Prior to our study, both areas were strongly affected by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and again damaged to a lesser degree by Hurricane Georges in 1998, increasing canopy openness and subsequently increasing tree stem densities. Between 2001 and 2015, changes in the light environment and the recovery of forest structure resulted in roughly a 50% reduction in tree stem densities in the high-intensity land-use area, as recruited saplings naturally thinned. In this area, liana abundance increased by 103%, liana biomass tripled, and occupancy of trees by lianas grew by nearly 50%. In the low-intensity land-use area, juvenile stem densities were stable, and resultantly liana abundance only increased by 33%, liana biomass rose 39%, and the occupancy of trees was constant. Liana flower and fruit production increased over the 14-year interval, and these increases were much greater in the high-intensity land-use quadrats. Results of this study do show how rapid forest tree successional dynamics coincide with liana increases, but the confounding of hurricane effects of disturbance at our site, prevent us from asserting that the increases in liana density and biomass can be attributed to the same causes as those in forests elsewhere in the Neotropics. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.","Hurricane disturbance; Land-use legacy; Lianas; Puerto Rico; Tropical forest","Hogan, J.A.; Department of Environmental Science, United States; email: jamesaaronhogan@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016202025

We sampled individuals of 18 tree species, which occurred in two forest physiognomies; open forest with canopy interrupted by palm trees and closed, denser forest, with emergent trees. We hypothesized that infection incidence would be higher in open than in closed forest, irrespective of the mistletoe species involved. In addition, we expected that mistletoe parasitism would be higher on host species that were more abundant, taller, deciduous, and had less dense wood. We sampled 870 individual trees in both sites combined. All but one host species was infected by at least one species of mistletoe. We found 13 mistletoe species/morphospecies, Loranthaceae (7) and Viscaceae (6), parasitizing very different hosts. Mistletoe infection incidence was higher in the closed forest (10.3%) than in the open forest (5.4%). In the closed forest, host height influenced incidence positively, while deciduousness had a negative influence. Our results show that mistletoes are common in the canopy of pristine tropical forests and, contrary to expectations, that infection incidence was higher in the closed forest. The positive relation between infection incidence and host height in this forest type suggests that emergent trees have higher chances of being infected than individuals of correspondent species in the lower forest layers. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Hemiparasite; Host–parasite interaction; Mistletoe assembly; Reduced Impact Logging","Fadini, R.F.; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Recursos Naturais da Amazônia, Rua Vera Paz, s/n, Brazil; email: rfadini@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997482216

Results showed that there were a large number of trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) < 30 cm in the two logged forests. Additionally, the two logged forests only had 40% of the basal area of the large trees (DBH ≥ 30 cm) found in the old growth forest. The species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices generally showed no difference among the three forest types. MCC had 70% of the species richness of the large trees in the MOG, whereas MSL and MOG had similar species richness. High value timber species had similar species richness among the three forest types, but a lower abundance and basal area of large trees in MCC. The species composition was distinct between the three forests. Large trees belonging to the family Fagaceae dominated in the logged forests and played a more important role in the old growth forest.

Understanding how biodiversity will respond to RIL demands assessments that include interactions among initial site conditions, specific harvest techniques, and responses of species that can be compared across varied forest types and regions. We assessed the short-term effects of RIL on 10 avian species in logged and unlogged portions of two concessions in Acre State, Brazil. We performed 460 point-count surveys and estimated variation in occupancy using a removal model that accounts for imperfect detection. Species were selected to include birds with contrasting expected responses to logging activities. We also conducted vegetation assessments at bird sampling locations, paying particular attention to bamboo (Guadua spp.) structure and distribution due to its dominance in forests of the region and high importance as a habitat component for Amazonian birds. Occupancy of four species varied between RIL and unlogged areas and was highly influenced by the percentage of bamboo present. Overall, bird responses to logging was greater where percent cover of bamboo was highest and, for two species, elevated occupancy was closely associated with elevated bamboo density. Bamboo dominance did not differ between logged and unlogged areas; our analysis indicated that this may have resulted from avoidance of bamboo stands by logging crews. This potential behavior, in turn, insured that bamboo refuges were maintained within logged areas, aiding species otherwise negatively affected by logging. Our work suggested how important logger behavior can be in influencing the structure of wildlife habitat under RIL management and that bird responses to logging, both positive and negative, are strongly influenced by local forest conditions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bamboo; Bird; Forest management; Logging; Tropical forest","Chaves, W.A.; Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation, United States; email: willandiac@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994050135

The conservation and replacement of nesting cavities depend critically on cavity persistence, which is predicted to decline with increasing anthropogenic impact to the habitat, and to vary according to characteristics of trees and excavators. We used Cox proportional-hazards models to study the factors influencing persistence of 277 cavities used by 43 species of nesting birds in 38 species of trees, across a gradient of human impact in the subtropical Atlantic Forest of Argentina, 2004–2016. Median cavity persistence was 6 years, with 79% of cavity losses caused by the collapse of either the whole tree or the section of the tree holding the cavity. Contrary to predictions, cavity persistence did not vary across habitats (primary forest, degraded forest, farm) or excavator types (true woodpecker vs. weak excavator). Persistence was highest (median > 10 years) for non-excavated cavities in live trunks of healthy trees, and increased with tree size and species-specific wood density. Thus, although logging and conversion to farmland remove most cavities, the cavities that remain in these human-modified habitats provide high quality, multi-annual nest sites for forest birds. Preserving and restoring these cavities should be a priority for conservation of forest vertebrates. The positive effect of species-specific wood density on cavity persistence suggests a trade-off in rates of cavity turnover, whereby cavities are produced early but lost quickly in fast-growing (low wood density) pioneer tree species, and produced late but persist much longer in slow-growing (high wood density) climax species. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Atlantic Forest; Hole-nesting bird; Nest site; Tree hollow; Wood density; Woodpecker","Cockle, K.L.; Instituto de Bio y Geociencias del NOA (IBIGEO-CONICET), Av. 9 de Julio 14, Argentina; email: kristinacockle@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994008690

We addressed this with an experimental study in a selectively logged Ugandan rainforest that has failed to recover naturally. Our objective was to examine seedling emergence and performance (seedling height) and natural recruitment of indigenous tree species to better understand the factors that limit natural regeneration of forest. Seeds of 12 indigenous tree species were sown in forest gaps to examine the effect of herbaceous vegetation (manipulated with vegetation clearance), vertebrate herbivores (manipulated with vertebrate exclusion) and gap size on seedling emergence and performance, natural recruitment and seed disturbance. Seedling emergence was generally low, but showed high species-specific variation (range 0–50%). Emergence was significantly more likely to occur when vegetation was cleared and when seeds were protected from vertebrates. Seedlings also performed better when protected from vertebrates. Natural recruitment was low, limited to early successional species and enhanced by vegetation clearance. Seed disturbance was common. Our findings imply that regeneration of selectively logged forests is limited by barriers linked to herbaceous vegetation and vertebrate herbivores and granivores. However, seedling emergence and performance of some of the sown species was high, indicating that direct seeding can support reforestation efforts but that careful attention needs to be paid on species selection.

In tropical forests the biomass of ants and termites alone exceeds that of all other animals. Core ecosystem services provided by insects include pollination, decomposition and soil formation, biological control, and population regulation of other animals. Insects are crucial dietary components for myriad vertebrates, especially amphibians, reptiles, songbirds, bats, and small mammals. Studies from across the globe, but especially the northern hemisphere, are reporting alarming insect declines, both in abundance and in species diversity. Principal threats include habitat degradation (with deforestation and agricultural practices), invasive species, climate change, pollution (with nontarget pesticide effects), and pathogens. Anthropocene insect losses will trigger new upward and downward consequences to communities and ecosystems. Insects with low reproductive potential, specialized habits, small ranges, and low dispersability (especially flightless taxa) are at greatest risk of extinction. Tropical rainforests are home to the richest insect faunas, and on all continents these forests are under extreme threats from logging and agricultural practices. Metapopulation structure and other special aspects of insect life histories often warrant the adoption of different paradigms, strategies, and policies relative to those embraced for the preservation of vertebrates. As is commonly the case with invertebrates, the data gaps relevant to insect conservation are enormous, especially for noncharismatic species: litter, soil, and canopy species, and tropical faunas.

However, excessive use of trees for cellulose-based products has continuously depleted world’s forest resources. Nowadays, around 14 % of deforestation is caused by logging for the production of wood cellulose-based products. Many scientists predicted that in 2030, only 10 % of the mature tropical forest will remain. In the era of declining forest resources and expansion of industrialization, it is a worthwhile effort to consider an alternative source of plant cellulose i.e. bacterial cellulose or biocellulose. Biocellulose produced by bacterial fermentation method using various substrates has been proven to be a remarkably versatile biomaterial for a variety of cellulose-based products. Interestingly, the highest cellulose worldwide demands are in the pharmaceutical sector with an annual demand of 30,000 tons. For Malaysia, as a country with vast agricultural areas, the use of generated agricultural wastes such as palm oil mill effluent, pineapple and sugarcane as a fermentation medium can not only avoid environmental pollution but also reduce the production cost. In fact, the use of agricultural wastes as a fermentation medium has proven to reduce 20 % of carbon sources supply for fermentation. In this respect, biocellulose production can play an important role in reducing global warming and preservation of nature. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Biocellulose; Cellulose-based products; Fermentation; Preservation of forestry; Reducing global warming; Use of agricultural wastes","Muhamad, I.I.; Department of Bioprocess and Polymer Engineering, Malaysia; email: idayu@cheme.utm.my",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071501615

Ants and plants often form such mutualistic relationships, with ants providing protection from herbivory, protection from competition from other plants, seed dispersal, C02and/or food, and receiving in return housing space and/or food from plants (Rico-Gray &amp; Oliveira, 2007). Some associations are symbiotic (i.e. partners live together) while in others ants receive food benefits, but nest elsewhere. In this review we focus on ant-plant symbioses (i.e. in which entire colonies of ants inhabit plants), since these tend to be more intimate associations, sometimes have high interaction specificity, and have clearly defined partners. Although symbioses usually involve ants inhabiting plant-evolved living spaces, this is not always the case, with ants sometimes inhabiting other structures (such as the leaf litter layer in litter-collecting species) but nonetheless providing benefits to the plant in terms of protection from herbivory (Gibernau et al., 2007; Fayle et al., 2012) or nutrients (Watkins et al., 2008). For the purposes of this chapter, we exclude ants using plants as attachment points for external nests such as those inhabiting carton structures. Symbiotic ant-plant mutualisms are particularly abundant in tropical forests (Bruna et al., 2005; Feldhaar et al., 2010), where they can play important roles in structuring ecosystems (Frederickson et al., 2005; Tanaka et al., 2009). Human-driven land-use causes changes to ecosystems worldwide, driven in the tropics mainly by logging of forests, clearance for expansion of agricultural land, and consequent fragmentation of remaining forest (Tilman et al., 2001; Edwards et al., 2014; Figure 3.1). Although the negative impacts of these processes on the number and identity of species are moderately well-known, changes in species interaction networks are much less studied despite being of key importance (Kaiser-Bunbury &amp; Blüthgen, 2015). This is because network structure can determine community stability in the face of further disturbance (Dunne &amp; Williams, 2009) and therefore affect associated ecosystem processes (Tylianakis et al., 2010). Symbiotic ant-plant networks are abundant in tropical forests and hence are likely to be affected by habitat disturbance (Mayer et al., 2014). However, remarkably little work has been dedicated to understanding how these networks respond to human-driven land use change (Table 3.1). © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048196491

The tropical forests of Indochina countries are rich in biodiversity and carbon density, and thus are significant from social, ecological, political and economic aspects. These forests provide essential livelihoods to the local and indigenous people. Rapid economic growth, agriculture expansion, illegal logging, population growth, and urbanization have been reported as major contributors to almost all cases of deforestation. Due to rapid development, forest resources are at a great risk. The FRA 2010 report shows that deforestation caused a loss of about 13 million hectares of tropical forests per year from the year 2000 to 2010. Therefore, there is an urgent need for better management of these resources. This book partially contributes towards climate change mitigation by implementing the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism. To mitigate climate change, most present studies are now concentrated on afforestation, reforestation and reducing deforestation and degradation. This book is focused on the application of multi-sensor remote sensing techniques to manage Cambodian forests for the effective implementation of the REDD+ mechanism. In this context, it is important to obtain reliable and consistent information of (a) forest cover, (b) deforestation, and (c) forest biomass to estimate CO2 emissions for the improvement of national carbon accounting. Additionally, this information will also be used for the development of the measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) system and for the management of forest resources to support sustainable forest management. Current knowledge is very limited with regard to the MRV system for REDD+ mechanism implementation. This book demonstrates the use of multi-sensor remote sensing techniques to manage the forest resources more sustainably. Further, it includes a concept on how precisely we can measure various forest parameters to minimize the uncertainty and to validate the results based on field data. The study is very much interdisciplinary in nature. It integrates core remote sensing techniques with the socio-economic angle of the REDD+ mechanism. It emphasizes on remote sensing as a technique for ensuring the MRV of REDD+ initiatives, taking into consideration its cost effectiveness in implementation. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, these forests often occur on rich soils, and are therefore prone to disturbance by agricultural activities. Across their range, many SDTFs are in various stages of regeneration, although little is known about their regeneration dynamics and temporal change in general. To fill this knowledge gap, we studied the changes in species diversity and community structure of an SDTF tree community with a history of past selective logging located in northern Minas Gerais, Brazil. We hypothesized an increase in species diversity and biomass-related parameters, along with a reduction in stem density for the community after five years of regeneration. In 2005, we measured all trees (diameter ≥ 3.18 cm at 1.3 m) within twenty 20 x 20 m (400 m2) plots in the patch, and we remeasured the trees in 2010. Between the two censuses, we found no significant changes in species richness and diversity, suggesting that species accumulation had leveled out. However, we found significant gains in tree basal area and recruitment, suggesting continual regeneration. Diameter class distributions of the five most abundant tree species showed similar patterns. We conclude that past disturbances can have ongoing effects on SDTF vegetation, although inter-annual variations may also play a regulatory role on community dynamics. © 2017, Universidad Austral de Chile.

Malaysia's natural forest is still an important source of valuable timber for the local timber industry which contributes to the international market. There is also an increasing recognition of the protective roles of the forests such as the conservation of biodiversity, protection of soil, water resources and stabilizing the climate. This causes the pressure to protect the forest, especially when related to carbon emissions. Reports have indicated that improved forest management through proper logging technique could enhance carbon stock and reduce carbon emission. The impact of forest logging on carbon stock changes is very crucial and need to be monitored. A study was carried out in an inland production forest in Lipis, Pahang to assess changes in carbon stocks between two different logging techniques; namely Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) and Low Impact Logging (LIL). The study found that LIL significantly increased carbon stocks of residual stands at about three times as compared to the RIL with 8.04 tC/ha and 24.34 tC/ha, respectively. Analysis using linear mixed effect model showed a significant result (p-value=0.0016) in terms of the interaction before and after logging of RIL and LIL techniques.

Here, we applied a proposed tree-based approach to evaluate logging damage in a tropical mixed deciduous forest in Bago Yoma, Myanmar and compared the cases with semi-evergreen forests of Cambodia. The logging damage was assessed in twenty 0.1-ha plots, each of which contained the stump and crown of one felled tree, and multinomial logistic regression was used to quantify the probability of the felled tree causing severe, slight, or no damage to residual trees. In both cases of Myanmar and Cambodia, severe damage was dependent on the size of the residual and felled trees, while slight damage was independent of the size of felled trees. There was no slight damage of residual trees with ≥50 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) in Myanmar, whereas slight damage increased with residual tree size in Cambodia and in tropical rain forests of other countries. This difference could be attributed to the sparseness of standing trees (98 trees ha−1) in our study site in Myanmar, which made it easier to control the felling direction to avoid damage to larger residual trees. Additionally, the probability of increasingly severe damage with increasing DBH of the felled trees was higher in Myanmar than in Cambodia; one of the reasons may be the steeper terrain at the Myanmar site. © 2017 The Japanese Forest Society.","Logging damage; Multinominal regression; Sizes of felled and residual trees; Tropical forestry","Mizoue, N.; Faculty of Agriculture, Japan; email: mizoue@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038079587

Renowned for its lowland tropical forests, its fame is more pronounced because a road that should be there is not: environmentalists have repeatedly, and remarkably, blocked all attempts to connect the Americas via the Pan American Highway. That lacuna, that absence of a road, also serves to occlude history in the region as its old-growth forests give the erroneous impression of a peopleless nature. In Crafting Wounaan Landscapes, Julie Velásquez Runk upends long-standing assumptions about the people that call Darién home, and she demonstrates the agency of the Wounaan people to make their living and preserve and transform their way of life in the face of continuous and tremendous change. Velásquez Runk focuses on Wounaan crafting–how their ability to subtly effect change has granted them resilience in a dynamic and globalized era. She theorizes that unpredictable landscapes, political decisions, and cultural beliefs are responsible for environmental conservation problems, and she unpacks environmental governance efforts that illustrate what happens when conservation is confronted with people in a purportedly peopleless place.

We examined the impact of selective logging on tree species richness, composition and structure prevalent after 27 years. Trees ≥ 30 cm girth at breast height were inventoried in four 1 ha plots in selectively logged patches and two 1 ha plots in an adjacent unlogged patch of lowland dipterocarp forest continuum, Uppangala, central Western Ghats, India. We enumerated 2343 trees (598 trees ha-1) belonging to 116 species (63 species ha-1) and 1345 trees (672 trees ha-1) belonging to 68 species (55 species ha-1) in logged and unlogged plots, respectively. The species richness in logged plots as compared to unlogged plots varied with spatial scale of sampling: at 1 ha scale two logged plots had higher species richness whereas it was high in only one plot at 400 m2 scale. Logged plots had low floristic similarity between them and also with the unlogged plots. Mantel and partial Mantel tests proved that logging was the main driver for the species composition rather than the elevation and spatial distance. Higher abundance of species belonging to canopy, intermediate and light wood categories and lower density of emergent, understory and medium wood types were recorded in the logged plots. As compared to unlogged plots, logged plots had 20-59% less above ground biomass (AGB) due to paucity of larger trees, especially in the emergent and medium wood types but higher AGB in canopy and hardwood categories. Our study shows the residual impact of logging even after 27 years and suggests that the recovery process may depend on the resurgence of emergent and medium wood categories. © International Society for Tropical Ecology.","Above ground biomass; Residual impact of logging; Structural ensembles; Trees; Tropical forest; Wood density categories","Ayyappan, N.; Department of Ecology, India; email: ayyappan.n@ifpindia.org",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028357197

To determine the response of lianas to a low-intensity selective timber harvest (2.7 trees ha-1, 2.9 m3 ha-1) carried out with reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques, liana regeneration was measured on 11 log landings and each of their associated primary skid trails, secondary skid trails and felling gaps. The study was conducted 10 months after a timber harvest in a lowland mixed tropical forest in Belize. Liana diversity, abundance and modes of regeneration (i.e. seed versus vegetative sprouts) were assessed by taxonomic family. Lianas were least abundant on log landings that experienced complete topsoil removal. Similarly, taxonomic family diversity and Shannon's entropy based on Renyi's diversity profile were lowest on log landings. Lianas, particularly those that regenerated directly from seeds, increased in abundance from felling gaps to secondary skid trails to primary skid trails. Liana recruitment was dominated (in order of decreasing abundance) by species in the Fabaceae, Bignoniaceae and Dilleniaceae. Fabaceae contributed the majority of seed-origin liana regeneration while most vegetative sprouts were Bignoniaceae. The results indicated that the low intensity RIL harvest studied retarded liana regeneration only on log landings and did not result in liana proliferation or extreme changes in liana community composition. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.","Climbing plants; Reduced-impact logging; Timber harvest; Tropical forest; Vines",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026837949

However, it is unclear whether this measure will effectively reduce forest loss, because disturbance agents other than logging may have substantial effects on forest loss. In this study, we investigated an approach to attribute disturbance agents to forest loss, and we characterized the attribution of disturbance agents, as well as the areas affected by these agents, in tropical seasonal forests in the Bago Mountains, Myanmar. A trajectory-based analysis using a Landsat time series was performed to detect change pixels. After the aggregation process that grouped adjacent change pixels in the same year as patches, a change attribution was implemented using the spectral, geometric, and topographic information of each patch via random forest modeling. The attributed agents of change include ""logging"", ""plantation"", ""shifting cultivation"", ""urban expansion"", ""water invasion"", ""recovery"", ""other change"", and ""no change"". The overall accuracy of the attribution model at the patch and area levels was 84.7% and 96.0%, respectively. The estimated disturbance area from the attribution model accounted for 10.0% of the study area. The largest disturbance agent was found to be logging (59.8%), followed by water invasion (14.6%).

In these disturbed landscapes, the juxtaposition of multiple habitat types can be especially important to fledglings and young birds, which may leave breeding grounds in human-altered habitat for different habitats nearby that provide increased foraging opportunities, reduced competition, and higher protection from predators. In this study, we evaluated the importance of three habitat types to two life stages of the critically endangered Bahama Oriole (Icterus northropi), a synanthropic songbird endemic to Andros, The Bahamas. First, we determined the avian species composition and relative abundance of I. northropi among three major vegetation types on Andros: Caribbean pine (Pinus caribaea) forest, coppice (broadleaf dry forest), and anthropogenic areas, dominated by nonnative vegetation (farmland and developed land). We then compared the foraging strategies and social interactions of two age classes of adult Bahama Orioles in relation to differential habitat use. Bird surveys late in the Bahama Oriole's breeding season indicated the number of avian species and Bahama Oriole density were highest in coppice. Some bird species occurring in the coppice and pine forest were never observed in agricultural or residential areas, and may be at risk if human disturbance of pine forest and coppice increases, as is occurring at a rapid pace on Andros. During the breeding season, second-year (SY) adult Bahama Orioles foraged in all vegetation types, whereas after-second-year (ASY) adults were observed foraging only in anthropogenic areas, where the species nested largely in introduced coconut palms (Cocos nucifera). Additionally, SY adults foraging in anthropogenic areas were often observed with an ASY adult, suggesting divergent habitat use for younger, unpaired birds. Other aspects of foraging (vegetation features, food-gleaning behavior, and food items) were similar for the two age classes. Older Bahama Orioles exhibited relatively higher rates of social interactions (intraspecific and interspecific pooled) in anthropogenic areas, and won more interaction outcomes compared to younger adults. Our findings concur with those of other studies indicating dry broadleaf forest is vitally important to migrating, wintering, and resident birds, including the critically endangered Bahama Oriole, which appears to depend heavily on this vegetation type during certain life stages. © 2017 Price and Hayes.","Anthropogenic habitat; Caribbean; Delayed plumage maturation; Dry tropical forest; Pine forest; Synanthropic species","Price, M.R.; Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Management, United States; email: melrprice@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021160922

We use both interview data conducted with long-term residents and/or landowners from 129 remnant forest patches and 15 continuous forest sites and line-transect census data from a subset of 21 forest patches and two continuous forests. Forest patch area was the strongest predictor of species persistence, explaining as much as 46% of the overall variation in gamebird species richness. Logistic regression models showed that anthropogenic disturbance- including surface wildfires, selective logging and hunting pressure-had a variety of effects on species persistence. Most large-bodied gamebird species were sensitive to forest fragmentation, occupying primarily large, high-quality forest patches in higher abundances, and were typically absent from patches <100 ha. Our findings highlight the importance of large (>10,000 ha), relatively undisturbed forest patches to both maximize persistence and maintain baseline abundances of large neotropical forest birds.","Bird; Disturbance; Hunting; Logging; Tropical forest; Wildfires","Michalski, F.; Laboratório de Ecologia e Conservação de Vertebrados, Brazil; email: fmichalski@unifap.br",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020200301

Effects of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) application were also reported. We observed lower CO2 fluxes in the logged forest (2.0-2.4 g carbon (C) m-2 day-1) than the primary forest (2.4-3.5 g C m-2 day-1). The lower fluxes were probably because root respiration and heterotrophic respiration were lower in the logged forest. Smaller amounts of microbial biomass C (840-985 and 589-641 μg C g soil-1 in the primary and secondary forests respectively) and N (109-143 and 106-117 μg N g soil-1) in the secondary forest than the primary forest suggested that there were less substrate inputs such as leaf and root litters, soil organic matters and root exudates in the former which produced less microbial population with lower heterotrophic respiration. Application of P increased CO2 emission (from 2.0-2.7 to 2.2-3.5 g C m-2 day-1) and microbial biomass N (from 106-115 to 110-143 μg N g soil-1), suggesting that the belowground ecosystems of both forests were limited by availability of P as reported in other tropical forests. Fluxes of CH4 showed no differences between forests or manipulation of nutrient because of the high variability of fluxes. Logging operation and nutrient application did not influence N2O fluxes. The invariable N2O fluxes occurred because water content was low during sampling and emission of N2O was restricted by water availability, which might have masked the effects of logging or nutrient application on N2O emission. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.","Logged forest; Microbial biomass; Primary forest; Secondary forest","Mori, T.; Forest Ecology Laboratory, Kitashirakawa Oiwake-cho, Japan; email: taikimori7@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018894313

IFLs are critical for stabilizing terrestrial carbon storage, harboring biodiversity, regulating hydrological regimes, and providing other ecosystem functions. Although the remaining IFLs comprise only 20% of tropical forest area, they account for 40% of the total aboveground tropical forest carbon. We show that global IFL extent has been reduced by 7.2% since the year 2000. An increasing rate of global IFL area reduction was found, largely driven by the tripling of IFL tropical forest loss in 2011–2013 compared to that in 2001–2003. Industrial logging, agricultural expansion, fire, and mining/resource extraction were the primary causes of IFL area reduction. Protected areas (International Union for Conservation of Nature categories I to III) were found to have a positive effect in slowing the reduction of IFL area from timber harvesting but were less effective in limiting agricultural expansion. The certification of logging concessions under responsible management had a negligible impact on slowing IFL fragmentation in the Congo Basin. Fragmentation of IFLs by logging and establishment of roads and other infrastructure initiates a cascade of changes that lead to landscape transformation and loss of conservation values. Given that only 12% of the global IFL area is protected, our results illustrate the need for planning and investment in carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation efforts that target the most valuable remaining forests, as identified using the IFL approach. © 2017 The Authors. some rights reserved.",,"Potapov, P.; University of MarylandUnited States; email: potapov@umd.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017004043

Here, we show how changing land use systems have influenced soil C and N stocks, SOM physical fractions, and the origin of SOM in the Santarém region of the eastern Brazilian Amazon. Soil C and N stocks were calculated for the surface layer of 0-30 cm. Anthropogenic disturbances to the standing forest, such as selective logging and wildfires, led to significant declines in soil C and N stocks. However, in the long-term, the conversion of the Amazon forest to pasture did not have a noticeable effect on soil C and N stocks, presumably because of additional inputs from pasture grasses. However, the conversion to cropland did lead to reductions in soil C and N content. According to the physical fractionation of SOM, LUC altered SOM quality, but silt and clay remained the combined fraction that contributed the most to soil C storage. Our results emphasize the importance of implementing more sustainable forest management systems, whilst also calling further attention to the need for fire monitoring systems, helping to ensure the resilience of C and N stocks and sequestration in forest soils; thereby contributing towards urgently needed ongoing efforts to mitigate climate change. © 2017 by the authors.","Cropland; Pasture; Soil carbon; SOM physical fractions; Stable isotopes; Tropical forests","Cerri, C.E.P.; Department of Soil Science, 11 Pádua Dias Avenue, Brazil; email: cepcerri@usp.br",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014963761

The forests in this region attract global attention for a number of reasons. International support has gained momentum for both conservationist and indigenous rights movements. The Stern Review advised that to reduce global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions cheaply and quickly, further deforestation must be prevented. The situation is even worse in areas where indigenous Pygmy people live alongside the Bantu-speaking farmers. The improvement of infrastructure and forest-related legal reforms for the development of the logging industry were believed to lead toward poverty reduction in rural areas. In the New World, these criteria suffice in most cases because it is usually clear who are the indigenous people within a particular country. © 2014 by Taylor and Francis.",,"Ichikawa, M.; Kyoto UniversityJapan",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009664540

Hopes for the simultaneous achievement of conservation goals and poverty alleviation are therefore increasingly placed on forests used for timber extraction. Most timber exploitation is carried out unsustainably, which causes forest degradation. Two important mechanisms have emerged to promote sustainable forest management: certification and community-based forest management (CFM). We synthesize the published information about how forest certification and CFM perform in terms of environmental, social, and economic variables. With the caveat that very few published studies meet the standards for formal impact evaluation, we found that certification has substantial environmental benefits, typically achieved at a cost of reduced short-term financial profit, and accompanied by some improvement to the welfare of neighboring communities. We found that the economic and environmental benefits of CFM are understudied, but that the social impacts are controversial, with both positive and negative changes reported. We identify the trade-offs that likely caused these conflicting results and that, if addressed, would help both CFM and certification deliver the hoped-for benefits.

The database consisted of 142 trees of interest for logging in a forest under management for timber in Brazil's state of Acre. The trees chosen for study were selected through proportional sampling by diameter class (ranging from 45 to 165 cm DBH) in order to properly represent the dominant and co-dominant tree populations with diameters appropriate for harvest. Subsequent to LIDAR profiling of these trees, they were felled, subjected to a battery of dimensional measurements and sampled for wood-density determination. A set of models was generated, followed by model selection and identity testing in order to compare groups of basic wood density (low, medium and high). The morphometric variables of the crown had high explanatory power for bole biomass independent of whether the allometric equations included DBH. When calculating bole biomass with equations that include basic wood density, the best estimate is obtained using variables for both DBH and crown morphology. To obtain an allometric equation that encompasses species in all three classes of basic density, one should either use only independent variables representing crown dimensions or complement these with variables for basic density (BD) and total height (Ht). The study demonstrates the feasibility of using ground-based measurements to calibrate biomass models that include only LIDAR-based variables, allowing much larger areas to be surveyed with reasonable accuracy. The present study is designed to produce data needed for forest management, but the methods developed here can be adapted to studies aimed at reducing the uncertainty in biomass estimates of whole forests (not just harvestable trees) for use in quantifying carbon emissions from forest loss and degradation. © 2016 The Author(s)","Airborne LIDAR; Forest profiling; Linear regression models; Logging; Rainforest; Tropical forest","Fearnside, P.M.; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia (INPA), Av.

Seed predation is a strong determinant of plant reproductive success, but it remains unclear how defaunation modifies this process. We examined the effects of hunting-induced defaunation on seed predation and seedling establishment, using replicated exclosure treatments at six sites across a defaunation gradient in northeastern Gabon. We monitored 5580 seeds of eight commercially important tree species that varied in seed traits such as size and dispersal mode. Rodents caused the greatest seed mortality for all species, removing ∼60% of accessible seeds. In comparison, invertebrates and fungi together caused just 6% of seed mortality. With protection from rodents, more than twice as many seeds established as seedlings, demonstrating that vertebrate seed predation was a strong filter on recruitment. With increasing defaunation, the proportion of seeds removed by rodents increased significantly, and seedling establishment decreased significantly, for most species. In heavily defaunated sites, with the lowest abundances of large mammals, seed removal by rodents increased by 63% and seedling establishment decreased by 42% compared to sites with intact fauna. Diminished seedling establishment is likely to reduce the regeneration of many tree species – including some with commercial importance – in hunted forests, with detrimental economic consequences. In turn, declines in timber regeneration may increase the likelihood that selectively logged forests are converted to non-forest land uses with little conservation value. Appropriate management could preclude these outcomes, to the benefit of both wildlife and natural timber regeneration. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Aucoumea klaineana; Lophira alata; Rodents; Selective logging; Timber; Trophic cascade","Rosin, C.; Nicholas School of the Environment, 450 Research Drive, United States; email: cooper.rosin@duke.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992467551

Currently, in forest management practiced in the Amazon Region, growth and production models are not used to predict the future stock of the forest. Thus, the sustainable economic and environmental aspects of this activity remain uncertain. The aim of this present work was to model the growth of individual trees in a forest managed in the Amazon Region, by using artificial neural networks (ANN) to serve as subsidy to the wielder in obtaining future stock after logging, thus reducing uncertainty on forest management sustainability. Selective harvest was carried out in 1979 with an intensity of 72.5 m3 ha−1 in a 64 ha area in the Tapajós National Forest - PA. In 1981, 36 permanent plots (50 m × 50 m) were installed at random and inventoried. There were nine successive measurements in 1982, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2007, 2010, and 2012. In the modeling of the future diameter, training and testing of ANN were carried out, including different semi-independent competition indexes (DSICI). All ANN, with and without DSICI, presented correlation above 99%, RMSE below 11%, and EF above 0.98. Based on the prognosis of tree growth, we were able to conclude that ANN can be effectively used to assist in the management of tropical forests and, thus, allow for the most suitable cutting intensity and cutting cycle per species, ensuring environmental and economic sustainability of forest management. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,"Reis, L.P.; Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Avenida Peter Henry Rolfs, s/n, CEP 36.570-900, Viçosa, Brazil; email: leonardopequenoreis@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992467231

Increases in tree cover have concentrated in nations with recent histories of extensive deforestation, humid climates, high crop yields, and small numbers of farm workers. The associations of expanded tree cover with high yields for cereal crops and small populations of cultivators suggests a dynamic, sometimes referred to as a forest transition, in which urbanization and industrialization promote a long-term expansion in tree cover on certain types of land. The association of tree cover gains with tree cover losses and humid climates suggests a second dynamic, a churning, treadmill-like production of wood products from lands subjected to recurring harvests of wood products followed by tree cover gains in the recently harvested areas. The forest transition dynamic suggests that many smallholders would allow tree cover to expand on their lands if payments for environmental services were available. The salience of the treadmill dynamic of tree cover losses followed by tree cover gains underscores the importance of questions about the implications of commercial tree monocultures for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and social justice. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Deforestation; Forest transition; Logging; Reforestation; Tropical forests","Rudel, T.K.; Departments of Human Ecology and Sociology, 55 Dudley Road, United States; email: rudel@aesop.rutgers.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983502925

Here, we use the functional trait structure of Amazonian forest bird assemblages to explore the impacts of land-cover change on two ecosystem processes: seed dispersal and insect predation. We show that trait structure in assemblages of frugivorous and insectivorous birds remained stable after primary forests were subjected to logging and fire events, but that further intensification of human land use substantially reduced the functional diversity and dispersion of traits, and resulted in communities that occupied a different region of trait space. These effects were only partially reversed in regenerating secondary forests. Our findings suggest that local extinctions caused by the loss and degradation of tropical forest are non-random with respect to functional traits, thus disrupting the network of trophic interactions regulating seed dispersal by forest birds and herbivory by insects, with important implications for the structure and resilience of human-modified tropical forests. Furthermore, our results illustrate how quantitative functional traits for specific guilds can provide a range of metrics for estimating the contribution of biodiversity to ecosystem processes, and the response of such processes to land-cover change. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In southeast Asia, enrichment planting with seedlings of the dominant group of dipterocarp tree species aims to accelerate restoration of forest structure and functioning. The role of tree diversity in forest restoration is still unclear, but the ‘insurance hypothesis’ predicts that in temporally and spatially varying environments planting mixtures may stabilize functioning owing to differences in species traits and ecologies. To test for potential insurance effects, we analyse the patterns of seedling mortality and growth in monoculture and mixture plots over the first decade of the Sabah biodiversity experiment. Our results reveal the species differences required for potential insurance effects including a trade-off in which species with denser wood have lower growth rates but higher survival. This trade-offwas consistent over time during the first decade, but growth and mortality varied spatially across our 500 ha experiment with species responding to changing conditions in different ways. Overall, average survival rates were extreme in monocultures than mixtures consistent with a potential insurance effect in which monocultures of poorly surviving species risk recruitment failure, whereas monocultures of species with high survival have rates of selfthinning that are potentially wasteful when seedling stocks are limited. Longer-term monitoring as species interactions strengthen will be needed to more comprehensively test to what degree mixtures of species spread risk and use limited seedling stocks more efficiently to increase diversity and restore ecosystem structure and functioning. © 2016 The Authors.","Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning; Dipterocarpaceae; Forest restoration; Sabah biodiversity experiment; Selective logging; Tropical forest","Hector, A.; Department of Plant Sciences, South Parks Road, United Kingdom; email: andrew.hector@plants.ox.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006100732

The study area comprised approximately 166 000 ha in the Kouilou Département, Republic of Congo, a section of land targeted for extensive future development. In total 156 forest sample sites were surveyed using the Braun-Blanquet method of phytosociology. Diversity of each plant community was expressed in terms of species richness; Shannon-Wiener index; exponent of Shannon-Wiener index; evenness; Fisher’s alpha; Simpson’s index; and inverse Simpson index. Eleven plant communities were described and mapped at a much finer scale than has been done previously. The communities were arranged along two gradients: a degraded – relatively intact gradient and a wet – dry gradient. The least degraded communities, and consequently those with the highest conservation value, were the swamp forests and the okoumé forest. Overall, the values reported for the diversity parameters in the current study were within the range reported for other tropical forests in Central Africa. The study revealed a gradient between the coast (west) and the Mayombe mountain range (east) in plant diversity linked to topography and climate with plant diversity lowest at the coast. Furthermore, plant diversity was negatively related to the distance to human infrastructure. The forest communities appear to be fairly resilient to past anthropogenic disturbances, however, there is no historical analogue to the more severe types of forest destruction associated with some of the future developments anticipated, such as mechanized logging or mining. © International Society for Tropical Ecology.","Diversity; Marantaceae forest; Okoumé forest; Phytosociology; Plant communities; Shannon-Wiener index","Gaugris, J.; FLORA FAUNA & MAN, Virgin Islands (British); email: jeromegaugris@florafaunaman.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008881541

While logging impacts on wildlife are predicted to change species distribution and abundance, the underlying physiological responses are poorly understood. Although there is a growing consensus that selective logging impacts on natural populations start with individual stress-induced sublethal responses, this literature is dominated by investigations conducted with vertebrates from temperate zones. Moreover, the sublethal effects of human-induced forest disturbance on tropical invertebrates have never been examined. To help address this knowledge gap, we examined the body fat content and relative abundance of three dung beetle species (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) with minimum abundance of 40 individuals within each examined treatment level. These were sampled across 34 plots in a before-after control-impact design (BACI) in a timber concession area of the Brazilian Amazon. For the first time, we present evidence of logging-induced physiological stress responses in tropical invertebrates. Selective logging increased the individual levels of fat storage and reduced the relative abundance of two dung beetle species. Given this qualitative similarity, we support the measurement of body fat content as reliable biomarker to assess stress-induced sublethal effects on dung beetles. Understanding how environmental modification impacts the wildlife has never been more important. Our novel approach provides new insights into the mechanisms through which forest disturbances impose population-level impacts on tropical invertebrates. © 2016 The Authors.

Quantitative analyses were conducted within and near forest concessions in Cameroon to determine the density of multiple use tree species that provide both timber for industry and foods consumed by local populations (fruit and oil or edible caterpillars), and how this has been affected by logging. Individuals of the three species (Moabi, Baillonella toxisperma; Sapelli, Entandrophragma cylindricum; and Tali, Erythrophleum suaveolens), including their stumps, were identified and measured on 5 ha (100 m × 500 m) sample plots around 4 villages and in 2 concessions. Around each village 21 sample plots, stratified by distance, were laid out along three transects extending 10 km towards the concession, each oriented 45° from the other. In concessions, 20 plots were established within the 2012 cutting unit after timber harvesting, using a stratified random system. Moabi trees occurred at the lowest densities: around villages, 22.8 ± 3.3/100 ha of precommercial individuals and 5.0 ± 1.4/100 ha of individuals of harvestable size (⩾80 cm dbh); on concessions, 7.5 ± 2.4 precommercial trees/100 ha, and 0–2.0 ± 1.4/100 ha harvestable individuals. Densities of Sapelli trees were not significantly different between villages and concessions, averaging 32.6 ± 3.8/100 ha and 37.5 ± 5.5/100 ha, respectively, for precommercial sizes and 9.5 ± 2.2/100 ha and 6 ± 1.6/100 ha, respectively, for harvestable trees (⩾100 cm dbh). Pre-commercial Tali trees occurred at lower densities (3.8 ± 0.9/100 ha) around villages, as compared to 11.5 ± 3.1/100 ha on concessions. Harvestable Tali trees (⩾60 cm dbh) occurred at the same densities around villages and on concessions (56.0 ± 7.2/100 ha). Half, or more, of commercial-sized trees of caterpillar-hosting species were left standing after harvest on concessions (89–94% of Tali; 50–79% of Sapelli), reflecting constraints due to timber quality, market demand and inaccessibility. No harvestable Moabi trees were logged from the 2012 cutting areas, reflecting agreements between communities and concessionaires to leave them for fruit and oil, but densities were so low it will be important that villagers conserve those around their villages. Stumps of all three species were found around villages, revealing that mechanisms for negotiation are also needed among villagers with interests in either timber or non-timber resources obtained from the same tree species. © 2016 The Authors","Caterpillars; Concessions; Congo Basin; Forest foods; Logging; Tropical forest","Snook, L.K.; Bioversity International, Via dei Tre Denari 472/aMaccarese 00057, Italy; email: l.snook@cgiar.org",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989311637

The primary narrative raised in the literature is that REDD+ will be of limited utility for reducing forest carbon loss in Southeast Asia, while the level of finance committed falls short of profits from alternative land-use activities in the region, including large-scale timber and oil palm operations. Here we assess the financial costs and carbon benefits of various REDD+ strategies deployed in the region. We find the cost of reducing emissions ranges from $9 to $75 per tonne of avoided carbon emissions. The strategies focused on reducing forest degradation and promoting forest regrowth are the most cost-effective ways of reducing emissions and used in over 60% of REDD+ projects. By comparing the financial costs and carbon benefits of a broader range of strategies than previously assessed, we highlight the variation between different strategies and draw attention to opportunities where REDD+ can achieve maximum carbon benefits cost-effectively. These findings have broad policy implications for Southeast Asia. Until carbon finance escalates, emissions reductions can be maximized from reforestation, reduced-impact logging and investing in improved management of protected areas.

However, little is known about their effects on genetic diversity within species. Aims: We assess the degree of genetic diversity among dipterocarp seedlings used for enrichment planting of selectively logged forests in Sabah, Malaysia, and compare it with diversity in naturally regenerating seedlings. Methods: We sampled young leaf tissues from seedlings of Shorea leprosula and Parashorea malaanonan for DNA genotyping, using microsatellite markers. Results: The levels of genetic diversity (expected heterozygosity and rarefied allelic richness) of naturally regenerating seedlings were statistically indistinguishable among unlogged, once logged and repeatedly logged forest areas. Enrichment-planted seedlings of P. malaanonan exhibited similar levels of genetic diversity to naturally regenerating seedlings whereas those of S. leprosula had significantly lower genetic diversity than natural seedlings. Interestingly, reduction of genetic variation was consistently observed in single-species plots relative to mixed-species plots among enrichment-planted seedlings. Conclusions: There was no reduction of genetic variation in naturally regenerating dipterocarp seedlings in areas of selective logging. However, genetic variation of enrichment-planted seedlings was lower in single-species plots relative to mixed-species plots. This suggests that enrichment-planting strategies should adopt diverse mixtures that should promote levels of both species richness and genetic diversity within species. © 2017 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.","allelic richness; enrichment planting; forest regeneration; genetic diversity; heterozygosity; microsatellites; Parashorea malaanonan; Shorea leprosula; species diversity","Shimizu, K.K.; Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, Switzerland; email: kentaro.shimizu@ieu.uzh.ch",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009250486

Consequently, inbreeding in tree populations may reduce fitness and increase extinction risks, especially among species that are predominantly outcrossing, dependent on biotic pollination and/or display limited seed dispersal such as species of the Dipterocarpaceae. Aims: To test the hypothesis that heterozygosity of individual progeny affects their likelihood of germination and the growth and survival of seedlings. Methods: Standardised measure of multilocus heterozygosity (sMLH) was estimated from seven microsatellite loci for individual progeny collected from 18 mother trees of the large dipterocarp Parashorea tomentella. The relationships among sMLH, germination and seedling growth and survival were determined for the progeny. Results: Seedling survival over 18 months increased with greater sMLH and fresh fruit weight. This result was expressed under all experimentally controlled combinations of light and nutrient availability in the nursery and in the shaded understorey of primary forest where survival overall was much lower than in the nursery. sMLH did not affect the probability of germination or seedling growth rate in any experimental treatment.

For deforested lands to have conservation value requires an understanding of regeneration rates of vegetation, the rates at which animals colonize and grow in regenerating areas, and the nature of interactions between plants and animals in the specific region. Here, we present data on forest regeneration and animal abundance at four regenerating sites that had reached the stage of closed canopy forest where the average dbh of the trees was 17 cm. Overall, 20.3 percent of stems were wind-dispersed species and 79.7 percent were animal-dispersed species, while in the old-growth forest 17.3 percent of the stems were wind-dispersed species. The regenerating forest supported a substantial primate population and encounter rate (groups per km walked) in the regenerating sites was high compared to the neighboring old-growth forests. By monitoring elephant tracks for 10 yr, we demonstrated that elephant numbers increased steadily over time, but they increased dramatically since 2004. In general, the richness of the mammal community detected by sight, tracks, feces, and/or camera traps, was high in regenerating forests compared to that documented for the national park. We conclude that in Africa, a continent that has seen dramatic declines in the area of old-growth forest, there is ample opportunity to reclaim degraded areas and quickly restore substantial animal populations. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","Acanthus pubescens; elephants; Lantana camara; logged forest; primates; restoration ecology; tropical rain forest","Chapman, C.A.; Makerere University Biological Field Station, PO Box 967, Uganda; email: Colin.Chapman@McGill.ca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995903059

The landscape approach to conservation (known also as the ecosystem approach) is one such hybrid governance platform. Implemented worldwide over the past decade by international NGOs, the landscape approach employs the ‘ecosystem principles’ of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). In spite of its prominence as a conservation and development strategy, little political ecology scholarship has considered the landscape approach. This article offers a case study of a conservation landscape in the Congo Basin, the Tri-National de la Sangha (TNS), which connects tropical forests in Cameroon, Republic of Congo, and Central African Republic. Led by NGOs, the TNS has since 2001 relied on partnerships among logging companies, safari hunters, the state, and local communities. Although the landscape approach purports to facilitate re-negotiations of user rights, resource access patterns in the TNS appear to have molded to pre-existing power relations. Rather than incorporating local concerns and capabilities into management, local knowledge is discredited and livelihoods are marginalized. As a result, management occurs through spatially-demarcated zones, contrasting the fluidity of interactions among diverse groups: both human (loggers, hunter-gatherers, safari guides, NGOs) and non-human (trees, elephants). These findings are situated within a burgeoning literature on neoliberal environmental governance, and suggest that ensuring ecologically and socially positive outcomes will require careful and iterative attention to linkages between ecological processes and evolving power dynamics. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cameroon; Conservation landscape; Ecosystem approach; Neoliberal conservation; Tropical forest; Wildlife",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988980401

Predator-mobbing is a widespread anti-predator behavior in birds that expresses a well-known trade-off influencing prey survival under predation risk. Here, we ask whether the predator-mobbing behavior of understory forest birds is altered by selective logging and associated forest structural changes in the highly endangered lowland rainforest of Sumatra. At four study sites spanning a gradient of logging-induced forest degradation, we used standardized mobbing and owl call playbacks with predator model presentation to elicit the predator-mobbing behavior of understory prey birds, compared birds’ mobbing intensity across sites, and related variation in this intensity to forest vegetation structure. We found that selective logging altered birds’ predator-mobbing intensity (measured by behavioral conspicuousness and propensity to approach the predator) as well as forest structure, and that vegetative changes to canopy and understory were correlated with contrasting responses by the two major bird foraging guilds, gleaning versus flycatching birds. We additionally discuss the implications of our findings for further hypothesis testing pertaining to the impacts of selective logging on the ecological processes underlying prey mobbing behavior, particularly with regards to predator–prey interactions and prey accruement of energy reserves. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Birds; Foraging guild; Habitat change; Playback; Sumatra; Understory","Hua, F.; Program in Science, United States; email: hua.fangyuan@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978870776

In tropical areas, hosting large biomass and biodiversity resources which are often threatened by unsustainable anthropogenic pressures, frequent forest resources monitoring is needed. Lidar is a powerful tool to estimate aboveground biomass at fine resolution; however its application in tropical forests has been limited, with high variability in the accuracy of results. Lidar pulses scan the forest vertical profile, and can provide structure information which is also linked to biodiversity. In the last decade the remote sensing of biodiversity has received great attention, but few studies focused on the use of lidar for assessing tree species richness in tropical forests. This research aims at estimating aboveground biomass and tree species richness using discrete return airborne lidar in Ghana forests. We tested an advanced statistical technique, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), which does not require assumptions on data distribution or on the relationships between variables, being suitable for studying ecological variables. We compared the MARS regression results with those obtained by multilinear regression and found that both algorithms were effective, but MARS provided higher accuracy either for biomass (R2 = 0.72) and species richness (R2 = 0.64). We also noted strong correlation between biodiversity and biomass field values. Even if the forest areas under analysis are limited in extent and represent peculiar ecosystems, the preliminary indications produced by our study suggest that instrument such as lidar, specifically useful for pinpointing forest structure, can also be exploited as a support for tree species richness assessment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Carbon monitoring; Lidar; Species richness; Tropical forests; West Africa","Vaglio Laurin, G.; Department for Innovation in Biological, Italy; email: gaia.vl@unitus.it",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996587387

Birds have been studied to determine their responses to landscape changes in the North Selangor Peat Swamp Forest (NSPSF). We captured 1045 birds from 72 species of the NSPSF and 168 individual birds from 13 species in oil palm plantations using mist-netting. Our results show that peat swamp forest supports more bird species than the oil palm areas. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling revealed that both vegetation types had an influence on bird species composition. SIMPER analysis also showed that the percentage of the assemblage similarity within the oil palm areas was 51.30 %, while it was 31.32 % in the peat swamp. We found that the populations of frugivores, insectivores, and omnivores were significantly higher in the peat swamp forest, whereas there was no significant difference in the granivores between the two sites.

This paper is the first to develop a Hartman model with selective cutting in this setting that takes additionality of carbon sequestration explicitly into account. We apply the model using data for Kalimantan, Indonesia, for both private and government forest managers. The latter have a lower discount rate and are exempt from taxes. RIL leads to less damages on the residual stand than CL and has lower variable but higher fixed costs.

Previously unlogged forest was subjected to conventional logging (CL), reduced-impact logging (RIL), or was set aside as an unlogged control. All trees ≥25 cm DBH and all trees of commercial species ≥10 cm DBH were monitored in a 24.5 ha plot in each treatment, with a 5.25 ha subplot in each for monitoring all trees ≥10 cm DBH. Above-ground biomass and bole volumes of merchantable species were tracked based on 10 inventories made between 1993 and 2014. Pre-logging biomass and bole volumes of commercial species were estimated as 237, 231, and 211 Mg ha-1, and 78, 80, and 70 m3 ha-1, in the RIL, CL, and unlogged plots, respectively.

Over the first twenty years after logging, average volume increments from commercial species were substantially higher in the RIL plot (0.72 m3 ha-1 year-1) than in the CL plot (0.08 m3 ha-1 year-1). Recovery of both biomass and timber volumes were temporarily reversed between 2009 and 2014 due to a 4-fold increase in annual mortality rates in the RIL plot and a 5.5-fold increase in the CL plot (as well as a 3-fold increase in the control plot), all presumably related to the extreme drought of 2010.

The results showed that 1) the competition of P. massoniana and the main planting species in mixed forest were ranked as: Castanopsis hystrix > Manglietia glauca > Quercus griffithii > Pinus massoniana > Michelia hedyosperma > Erythrophleum fordii, and average competition index in different transformation modes was ranked as: A1 > A3 > A4 > A2. 2) The number of objective and competitive trees was 212 and 336, respectively in mixed stand. The number of P. massoniana was 190 in monoculture stand. The competition index in monoculture forest (359.51) was larger than in mixed forest (166.98). It meant that the appropriate intensity of logging effectively reduced the pressure of competition. The intraspecific competition only existed in monoculture forest. The intraspecific and interspecific competition index of P. massoniana was each accounted for 54.65% and 45.35% in the mixed forests. 3) The intraspecific competition index of Pinus massoniana had significant difference among mixed forest and monoculture forest. It decreased gradually with the increase of diameter at breast height (DBH), and the average competition indices with diameter grade in mixed forest were less than in control monoculture forest. 4) The interspecific competition pressure came from fast-growing trees firstly. The relationship of Pinus massoniana and main species (CI > 1) followed as: Quercus griffithii > Manglietia glauca > Castanopsis hystrix > Michelia hedyosperma > Schefflera octophylla > Trema cannabina > Styrax tonkinensis > Erythrophleum fordii > Ficus esquiroliana. The interspecific competition between each model had no difference. 5) The index of Pinus massoniana decreased with the increase of DBH. The relationship between total and intraspecific competition index and DBH accorded with power and hyperbola function respectively in mixed forest. The relationship between competition index and DBH conformed to logarithmic function in monoculture forest. It showed a stronger competition intensity at DBH of <25 cm and appeared weaker at DBH over 25 cm. According to analysis of competition of close- to-nature transformation forest, we know that cutting disturbance trees and enriching species could reduce competitive pressure of Pinus massoniana and facilitate growth of enrichment species and natural regeneration. As well as it could guide positive succession to form multiple layer, uneven-aged and mixed forest. This study proved the rationality and feasibility of transformation from monoculture plantation to close-to-nature forest. © 2016, Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing Forestry University.

We assess genetic variation of C. alternans, genetic exchange, differentiation, bottlenecks, effective population size and signals of natural selection. Genetic diversity was higher in conserved than in fragmented forest but not significant. Fragmentation did not play a significant role in genetic diversity, possibly due to the populations heterogeneity. C. alternans has been subject to a pronounced isolation of trees as a product of logging, thus raising inbreeding. Bayesian clustering show a trend towards an increased structuring over the course of generations but also, indicates that populations have recently gone through a bottleneck. The bottleneck following deforestation was not severe enough to lower the effective size, this could lead to high standing genetic diversity, providing a buffer against genetic erosion. We observed directional and balancing selection in C. alternans.

Yet, over 70% of all remaining tropical forests are growing in former agricultural or logged areas. We investigated the relationship among land use history, biotic and abiotic factors, and soil fungal community composition and diversity in a second-growth tropical forest in Puerto Rico. We coupled high-throughput DNA sequencing with tree community and environmental data to determine whether land use history had an effect on soil fungal community descriptors. We also investigated the biotic and abiotic factors that underlie such differences and asked whether the relative importance of biotic (tree diversity, basal tree area, and litterfall biomass) and abiotic (soil type, pH, iron, and total carbon, water flow, and canopy openness) factors in structuring soil fungal communities differed according to land use history. We demonstrated longlasting effects of land use history on soil fungal communities. At our research site, most of the explained variation in soil fungal composition (R2 = 18.6%), richness (R2 = 11.4%), and evenness (R2 = 10%) was associated with edaphic factors. Areas previously subject to both logging and farming had a soil fungal community with lower beta diversity and greater evenness of fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) than areas subject to light logging. Yet, fungal richness was similar between the two areas of historical land use. Together, these results suggest that fungal communities in disturbed areas are more homogeneous and diverse than in areas subject to light logging. Edaphic factors were the most strongly correlated with soil fungal composition, especially in areas subject to light logging, where soils are more heterogenous. High functional tree diversity in areas subject to both logging and farming led to stronger correlations between biotic factors and fungal composition than in areas subject to light logging. In contrast, fungal richness and evenness were more strongly correlated with biotic factors in areas of light logging, suggesting that these metrics might reflect long-term associations in old-growth forests. The large amount of unexplained variance in fungal composition suggests that these communities are structured by both stochastic and niche assemblage processes. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","Forest soil fungi; High-throughput sequencing; Land use history; Luquillo forest dynamics plot (LFDP); Puerto Rico; Tropical forest",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84985011847

However, few studies have considered the multivariate relationships of aboveground C storage with stand age, stand structural diversity, and species diversity in natural forests. In this study, aboveground C storage, stand age, tree species, DBH and height diversity indices, were determined across 80 subtropical forest plots in Eastern China. We employed structural equation modelling (SEM) to test for the direct and indirect effects of stand structural diversity, species diversity, and stand age on aboveground C storage. The three final SEMs with different directions for the path between species diversity and stand structural diversity had a similar goodness of fit to the data. They accounted for 82% of the variation in aboveground C storage, 55-59% of the variation in stand structural diversity, and 0.1 to 9% of the variation in species diversity. Stand age demonstrated strong positive total effects, including a positive direct effect (β = 0.41), and a positive indirect effect via stand structural diversity (β = 0.41) on aboveground C storage. Stand structural diversity had a positive direct effect on aboveground C storage (β = 0.56), whereas there was little total effect of species diversity as it had a negative direct association with, but had a positive indirect effect, via stand structural diversity, on aboveground C storage. The negligible total effect of species diversity on aboveground C storage in the forests under study may have been attributable to competitive exclusion with high aboveground biomass, or a historical logging preference for productive species. Our analyses suggested that stand structural diversity was a major determinant for variations in aboveground C storage in the secondary subtropical forests in Eastern China. Hence, maintaining tree DBH and height diversity through silvicultural operations might constitute an effective approach for enhancing aboveground C storage in these forests. © Author(s) 2016.",,"Yan, E.-R.; School of Ecological and Environmental Sciences, China; email: eryan@des.ecnu.edu.cn",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983449580

Being transient pools of disturbance-killed trees, coarse woody debris (CWD) stocks play a key role in the carbon budget of such disturbed forests. Here, we investigated for the first time how logging affects the CWD input during and following a fire and, consequently, post-fire CWD stocks. Measurements were made at a permanent site in Bukit Soeharto Education Forest (BSEF) in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. This site consisted of plots that had been subjected to three different logging intensities (HF: heavily felled, trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥30 cm were felled; LF: lightly felled, trees with DBH ≥50 cm were felled; UF: unfelled), all of which were burned by a fire that occurred during a drought associated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation in 1998, shortly after logging. CWD mass were measured in 2012, following 14 years of monitoring the CWD inputs. The average CWD mass across the three logging treatments was 89 Mg ha-1, which is higher than the reported values for undisturbed forests but within the recorded range for recently disturbed forests. The amount of CWD inputs due to tree death during the fire was similar among the three treatments. However, there was a large difference in the CWD input in the post-fire period. In UF plots, large CWD inputs lasted for 2 years following the fire due to delayed tree death, whereas in HF and LF plots, where the above-ground biomass had greatly reduced by selective logging, no further large CWD inputs occurred after the fire. Consequently, the CWD stocks in the HF and LF plots were 50-60% lower than those in the UF plots. A simulation predicted that these CWD inputs during and shortly after the fire still constitute a large proportion of the CWD stocks in 2012, suggesting that the CWD pool is a rather durable carbon store in BSEF. In the HF and LF plots, there was few large diameter CWD pieces, reflecting the selective logging of large diameter trees, whereas, in the UF plots, there were large standing dead and uprooted trees. Since the larger diameter CWD pieces are persist in the forest for a longer time continuing to store carbon and to provide habitats for diverse wild life, selective logging could have large impacts on forest ecology and function not only by decreasing the total CWD inputs and stocks but also by decreasing the large diameter CWD pieces. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..","Carbon emission; Carbon stock; Coarse woody debris; Forest fire; Selective logging; Simulation","Osone, Y.; Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, 1 Matsunosato, Japan; email: osone@affrc.go.jp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965174486

(see Figure 14.1) The park was created in 1993 as an IUCN category II National Park when the Kingdom reopened its doors to the world. It is one of only two Cambodian ASEAN Heritage Parks and it was gazetted in an effort to protect the rare fauna of the area, such as tigers, elephants and leopards, and also to establish possibilities for ecotourism (Baird and Dearden, 2003: p. 543). Today, VNP, being part of the Annamite Cordillera, belongs to the Indo-Burma Biodiversity Hotspot region and as such has been listed by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund as one of the most endangered tropical forests in the world, see CEPF (2015). Some biologists and conservationists consider these forests the single most endangered forest on the planet (deBuys, 2015). Numerous groups of highlander tribes traditionally inhabit the park’s buffer zone, such as the Brao and Kavet. They are legally permitted to fish, hunt non-threatened species such as wild pigs, and collect non-timber forest products within the park’s boundaries. Highlanders are allowed to hunt deer and pigs, which are abundant in the park, but only using traditional methods such as trapping or crossbows and not guns (pers. comm. Thon Soukhon, VNP Deputy Director, 2014). They consider the largest mountains in VNP ‘spirit mountains’ (see Figure 14.2) and these and other ‘spirit places’ are surrounded by a rich animist folklore, the details of which vary between tribes and villages. Both VNP and the animist culture of the highlanders are under severe threat on numerous fronts, including Economic Land Concessions (ELCs), illegal logging, poaching, encroachment, road-building and other forms of economic development. © 2016 Bas Verschuuren and Naoya Furuta, selection and editorial material; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107595386

We found decaying wood affected physical, chemical, and biotic properties of the underlying soil. Soil temperature was less variable under the decaying logs than away from the logs. Soil under the decaying wood had fewer roots, and lower NO3- and Mg2+ availability than samples collected a distance of 50 cm away from the logs. Tree species and decay stage were important factors defining the effect of decaying wood on the distribution of available nutrients. Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ levels were higher in the soil associated with the youngest logs, and were higher near S. macrophylla logs. Heavy metals were also higher in the soil located near the younger logs independent of the species; other metal ions such as Al3+ and Fe3+were higher in the soil were higher in the soil associated with D. excelsa and the oldest logs.

Estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) with high accuracy is crucial to quantifying carbon stocks for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation-plus implementation (REDD+). Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a promising remote sensing technology that provides fine-scale forest structure variability data. This paper highlights the use of airborne LiDAR data for estimating the AGB of a logged-over tropical forest in Sabah, Malaysia. The LiDAR data was acquired using an Optech Orion C200 sensor onboard a fixed wing aircraft. The canopy height of each LiDAR point was calculated from the height difference between the first returns and the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) constructed from the ground points. Among the obtained LiDAR height metrics, the mean canopy height produced the strongest relationship with the observed AGB. This single-variable model had a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 80.02 t ha-1 or 22.31% of the mean AGB, which performed exceptionally when compared with recent tropical rainforest studies. Overall, airborne LiDAR did provide fine-scale canopy height measurements for accurately and reliably estimating the AGB in a logged-over forest in Sabah, thus supporting the state's effort in realizing the REDD+ mechanism.","Aboveground biomass; LiDAR; Sabah; Selective logging","Phua, M.-H.; Faculty of Science and Natural Resources, Malaysia; email: pmh@ums.edu.my",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988597073

We evaluated the effects of silvicultural systems with differing cutting rotations and enrichment planting regimes on the genetic diversity of Shorea parvifolia, an abundant and ecologically important tree in Southeast Asian rainforests. Our result showed that in most respects the genetic diversity is not significantly different between primary forest and the other silvicultural systems; however, the proportion of private alleles is significantly different between them. Intensive second-rotation (L3) harvesting of individuals >40 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) resulted in a sizable reduction in the number of reproductive trees and a dramatic decrease in the numbers of rare and private alleles, suggesting a negative impact on the genetic diversity of the remaining tree population. Enrichment planting with S. parvifolia in the logged forest improved some genetic parameters, significantly increasing the number of rare alleles in L3 in particular. We conclude that the genetic diversity of logged tropical forests gradually decreases depending on logging rotation times, especially with respect to sensitive genetic parameters such as the numbers of rare and private alleles, and that enrichment planting with native dipterocarps can maintain or even increase the genetic diversity of logged tropical forests in Southeast Asia. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Enrichment planting; Genetic diversity; Rotation; Selective logging; Shorea parvifolia","Tsumura, Y.; Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, Japan; email: tsumura.yoshihiko.ke@u.tsukuba.ac.jp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977125864

Therefore, road management is crucial in reconciling selective logging and biodiversity conservation. Most logging roads are abandoned after timber harvesting; however, little is known about their long-term impacts on forest vegetation and accessibility, especially in Central Africa. In 11 logging concessions in the Congo Basin, we field-sampled a chronosequence of roads that, judging from satellite images, had been abandoned between 1985 and 2015. We assessed recovery of timber resources, tree diversity and above-ground biomass in three zones: the road track, the road edge (where forest had been cleared during road construction) and the adjacent logged forest. The density of commercial timber species &lt;15 cm d.b.h. was almost three times higher in the road track (321 individuals ha−1) and edge (267) than in the logged adjacent forest (97). Over time, tree species diversity converged to a comparable level between roads and adjacent forests, along with an increase in canopy closure. The average width of forest clearing for road construction was 20 m, covering a total 0·76% of the forest area inside concessions. After 15 years following abandonment, road tracks had recovered 24 Mg ha−1 of above-ground woody biomass, which was 6% of that in the adjacent forest, while road edges had accumulated 167 Mg ha−1 (42%). Ten years after abandonment, roads were no longer penetrable by poachers on motorcycles. An exotic herb species was fully replaced by dominant Marantaceae that have even higher abundance in the adjacent forest. Synthesis and applications. Our evidence of vegetation recovery suggests that logging roads are mostly transient elements in the forest landscapes. However, given the slow recovery of biomass on abandoned road tracks, we advocate both reducing the width of forest clearing for road construction and reopening old logging roads for future harvests, rather than building new roads in intact forests. Road edges seem suitable for post-logging silviculture which needs to be assisted by removing dominant herbs during the early years after abandonment while the road track is still accessible. © 2016 The Authors.

Production forests as designated by national forest services cover up to 400 million ha, i.e. half of the forested area in the humid tropics. Forest management thus plays a major role in the global carbon budget, but with a lack of unified method to estimate carbon fluxes from tropical managed forests. In this study we propose a new time- and spatially-explicit methodology to estimate the above-ground carbon budget of selective logging at regional scale. Results: The yearly balance of a logging unit, i.e. the elementary management unit of a forest estate, is modelled by aggregating three sub-models encompassing (i) emissions from extracted wood, (ii) emissions from logging damage and deforested areas and (iii) carbon storage from post-logging recovery. Models are parametrised and uncertainties are propagated through a MCMC algorithm. As a case study, we used 38 years of National Forest Inventories in French Guiana, northeastern Amazonia, to estimate the above-ground carbon balance (i.e. the net carbon exchange with the atmosphere) of selectively logged forests. Over this period, the net carbon balance of selective logging in the French Guianan Permanent Forest Estate is estimated to be comprised between 0.12 and 1.33 Tg C, with a median value of 0.64 Tg C. Uncertainties over the model could be diminished by improving the accuracy of both logging damage and large woody necromass decay submodels. Conclusions: We propose an innovating carbon accounting framework relying upon basic logging statistics. This flexible tool allows carbon budget of tropical managed forests to be estimated in a wide range of tropical regions. © 2016 The Author(s).","Amazonia; Carbon cycle; Error propagation; Production forests; Selective logging","Hérault, B.; Cirad, Campus agronomique, French Guiana; email: bruno.herault@cirad.fr",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979701699

However, little is known about forest recovery dynamics across this region. Extrapolating findings from logged forests in tropical mainlands or large continental landbridge islands to isolated archipelagos such as the Solomons is inappropriate because succession and diversification patterns and processes differ between the former and latter. We compared the taxonomic diversity and composition of trees between unlogged forest and sites that were logged 10, 30 and 50 years previously to provide an indication of the potential dynamics of these forests following timber harvesting. The distance to logging roads and to unlogged forest influenced post-logging recovery, emphasising the importance of edge effects in previously logged forests. At least in the first 50 years after logging, tree-community composition did not appear to converge toward that in unlogged forests over time. Although species assemblages in logged forests generally tend to shift from light demanding-pioneers to old-growth species over time, a long-lived pioneer Campnosperma brevipetiolata dominated the forest even 50 years after logging. We suggest that recovery of the tree community in logged forests has been hindered by the persistence of C. brevipetiolata, and suggest that it could be thinned via careful silviculture techniques to enhance growth of mature-phase forest species. Removal of such persistent, long-lived pioneer trees could potentially help to accelerate recovery of heavily logged forests. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Logging; Recovery dynamics; Solomon Islands; Tree community composition; Tree diversity","Katovai, E.; Centre for Tropical Environmental and Sustainability Science, Australia; email: eric.katovai@my.jcu.edu.au",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962781131

However, maintaining forest cover may not reduce anthropogenic forest disturbances, which are rarely considered in conservation programmes. These disturbances occur both within forests, including selective logging and wildfires, and at the landscape level, through edge, area and isolation effects. Until now, the combined effect of anthropogenic disturbance on the conservation value of remnant primary forests has remained unknown, making it impossible to assess the relative importance of forest disturbance and forest loss. Here we address these knowledge gaps using a large data set of plants, birds and dung beetles (1,538, 460 and 156 species, respectively) sampled in 36 catchments in the Brazilian state of Pará. Catchments retaining more than 69-80% forest cover lost more conservation value from disturbance than from forest loss. For example, a 20% loss of primary forest, the maximum level of deforestation allowed on Amazonian properties under Brazil's Forest Code, resulted in a 39-54% loss of conservation value: 96-171% more than expected without considering disturbance effects. We extrapolated the disturbance-mediated loss of conservation value throughout Pará, which covers 25% of the Brazilian Amazon. Although disturbed forests retained considerable conservation value compared with deforested areas, the toll of disturbance outside Pará's strictly protected areas is equivalent to the loss of 92,000-139,000 km2 of primary forest. Even this lowest estimate is greater than the area deforested across the entire Brazilian Amazon between 2006 and 2015 (ref. 10). Species distribution models showed that both landscape and within-forest disturbances contributed to biodiversity loss, with the greatest negative effects on species of high conservation and functional value. These results demonstrate an urgent need for policy interventions that go beyond the maintenance of forest cover to safeguard the hyper-diversity of tropical forest ecosystems. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Reduced-impact logging (RIL) is a prominent activity accounting for such forestry practices to prevent strong forest disturbances. Our aims were to evaluate the effects of RIL on insect communities of forested streams from Eastern Amazon and to test the hypothesis of negative effects of RIL on species richness, abundance, and functional feeding groups of aquatic insect assemblages. Neither of the evaluated metrics of the studied assemblages were negatively affected by RIL. Environmental metrics, such as substrate heterogeneity, woody canopy cover, and hill slope height, varied more among RIL streams than in reference streams, indicating a gradient according to logging impacts, and are suitable candidates to monitor RIL impacts in Amazonian streams. In addition, the PHI index also varied among REF and RIL, according to age class and year of logging, which could reflect trends to recover the forest structure after logging in a time frame of only 10 years.

Location: Afram Headwaters Forest Reserve, southern Ghana. Methods: We established sampling areas and assessed seedlings and saplings <5 cm DBH in nine habitats. The habitats were logging road, skid trail, large canopy gaps dominated by B. papyrifera, large canopy gaps dominated by invasive Chromolaena odorata, Nauclea diderrichii plantation, Mansonia altissima plantation, Terminalia ivorensis plantation, abandoned farmland and unlogged forest. Results: We found that the abundance of pioneers declined with increasing abundance of B. papyrifera. This trend was more pronounced in the farmland and in the N. diderrichii plantation. By contrast, increased abundance of B. papyrifera did not lead to a decrease in the abundance of the shade-tolerant species. B. papyrifera seedlings and saplings were absent in the forest understorey. We also found a lower abundance and richness of some vulnerable tree species and valuable timber species in the N. diderrichii plantation and in gaps dominated by B. papyrifera.

This can provide a basis for future studies to explore the potential of such tree species in restoration programmes targeted at B. papyrifera-invaded sites. Our results also suggest that the integrity of the undisturbed forest patches in the landscape must be protected to help prevent B. papyrifera from spreading further.

The validity of the IDH remains contentious in tropical forests because the IDH has been supported in tropical dry forests but often not in humid tropical forests. We addressed the following questions: (1) is the IDH valid in humid tropical forests of Borneo; (2) how does the disturbance index (DI) influence conformity to the IDH; and (3) does the rainfall regime influence conformity to the IDH within the tropical biome?. Location: Humid tropical forests of northern Borneo. Methods: We established approximately 50 20-m radius circular plots across primary to highly degraded forests in each of three logging concessions. Species richness was regressed against the following four DIs: above-ground biomass (AGB), relative number (RNO) of pioneer trees, average wood density, and the principal component analysis (PCA) axis 1 score for the three DIs. For studies that examined the IDH in tropical forests, the relationship between total and dry season precipitation and the percentage reduction in species diversity from a unimodal maximum to the lowest disturbance level was examined. Results: Species richness peaked at intermediate disturbance levels when average wood density and PCA 1 score, but not AGB and pioneer RNO, were used as DIs. The peaks were relatively flat, with 8–11% reduction in species richness from a unimodal maximum to the lowest disturbance level. The percentage reduction in species richness from a unimodal maximum to the lowest disturbance level increased with decreasing total and dry season precipitation within the tropical biome. Conclusion: Species richness showed a unimodal response to disturbance, but conformity to the IDH varied with DI because different DIs may have different biological meanings. Species richness changed little from a moderately disturbed to the least disturbed stand in humid tropical forests compared with tropical dry forests, indicating that IDH is dependent on rainfall regime. © 2016 International Association for Vegetation Science","Disturbance index; HOF model; Intermediate disturbance hypothesis; Rainfall; Selective logging; Species density; Species richness; Wood density","Imai, N.; Primate Research Institute, Kanrin, Japan; email: imai.nobuo.2x@kyoto-u.ac.jp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961262600

Pioneer tree species are critical for facilitating the transition from deforested land to secondary forest because they stabilize terrain and enhance connectivity between forest fragments by increasing matrix permeability and initiating disperser community assembly. Despite the ecological importance of early successional species, little is known about their ability to maintain gene flow across deforested landscapes. Utilizing highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, we examined patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation for the pioneer understory tree Miconia affinis across the Isthmus of Panama. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of geographic distance, forest cover, and elevation on genetic differentiation among populations using circuit theory and regression modeling within a landscape genetics framework. We report marked differences in historical and contemporary migration rates and moderately high levels of genetic differentiation in M. affinis populations across the Isthmus of Panama. Genetic differentiation increased significantly with elevation and geographic distance among populations; however, we did not find that forest cover enhanced or reduced genetic differentiation in the study region. Overall, our results reveal strong dispersal for M. affinis across human-altered landscapes, highlighting the potential use of this species for reforestation in tropical regions. Additionally, this study demonstrates the importance of considering topography when designing programs aimed at conserving genetic diversity within degraded tropical landscapes. © 2016 Castilla et al.

We tested this hypothesis in the Caatinga vegetation - A seasonally dry tropical forest restricted to northeast Brazil. We sampled 11,653 individuals (adults, saplings, and seedlings) from 51 species in 29 plots distributed along a gradient of chronic disturbance. The gradient was assessed using a chronic disturbance index (CDI) based on five recognized indicators of chronic disturbances: proximity to urban center, houses and roads and the density of both people and livestock. We used linear models to test if mean effective number of lineages, mean phylogenetic distance and phylogenetic dispersion decreased with CDI and if such relationships differed among ontogenetic stages. As expected, the mean effective number of lineages and the mean phylogenetic distance were negatively related to CDI, and such diversity losses occurred irrespective of ontogeny. Yet the increase in phylogenetic clustering in more disturbed plots was only evident in seedlings and saplings, mostly because clades with more descendent taxa than expected by chance (e.g., Euphorbiaceae) thrived in more disturbed plots. This novel study indicates that chronic human disturbances are promoting the phylogenetic impoverishment of the irreplaceable woody flora of the Brazilian Caatinga forest. The highest impoverishment was observed in seedlings and saplings, indicating that if current chronic disturbances remain, they will result in increasingly poorer phylogenetically forests. This loss of evolutionary history will potentially limit the capacity of this ecosystem to respond to human disturbances (i.e., lower ecological resilience) and particularly their ability to adapt to rapid climatic changes in the region. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","Anthropogenic disturbance; Biodiversity; Community assembly; Environmental filtering; Forest- dependent human populations; Ontogenetic response; Phylogenetic diversity and structure; Seasonally dry tropical forest; Semiarid ecosystem; Wood plant assemblage","Leal, I.R.; Departamento de Botânica, Av.

To maintain the full range of forest ecosystem services and support the development of effective conservation policies, we must understand the overall impact of degradation on different forest resources. This research investigates the response to disturbance of forest structure using several indicators: soil carbon content, arboreal richness and biodiversity, functional composition (guild and wood density), and productivity. We drew upon large field and remote sensing datasets from different forest types in Ghana, characterized by varied protection status, to investigate impacts of selective logging, and of illegal land use and resources extraction, which are the main disturbance causes in West Africa. Results indicate that functional composition and the overall number of species are less affected by degradation, while forest structure, soil carbon content and species abundance are seriously impacted, with resources distribution reflecting the protection level of the areas. Remote sensing analysis showed an increase in productivity in the last three decades, with higher resiliency to change in drier forest types, and stronger productivity correlation with solar radiation in the short dry season. The study region is affected by growing anthropogenic pressure on natural resources and by an increased climate variability: possible interactions of disturbance with climate are also discussed, together with the urgency to reduce degradation in order to preserve the full range of ecosystem functions. © SISEF.","Africa; Degradation; Guild; Logging; Remote sensing; Tropical forest","Vaglio Laurin, G.; Impacts of Agriculture, V.

In Papua New Guinea (PNG) timber harvesting has been identified as a major contributor to deforestation and forest degradation but its impact on biodiversity is still poorly understood. In this study we investigated the effect of selective logging on tree taxonomic composition, structure and diversity of PNG forests. We used data from 101 one-hectare permanent sample plots (PSPs) belonging to two vegetation types: low altitude forests on plains and fans (type P) and low altitude forests on uplands (type H). We used multivariate techniques to test for significant differences in species composition between plots of different vegetation types and disturbance regimes, identifying the tree taxa to which these differences could be ascribed. ANOVA was used to test for differences between logged-over and unlogged forest PSPs with respect to biodiversity (richness, Shannon’s diversity, Pielou’s evenness) and stand structure (stem density, basal area – BA). Temporal trends of forest features were analyzed using linear regression. Significant differences in taxonomic composition were found between logged-over and unlogged plots of the H type (p = 0.04). No differences were found in richness, diversity and evenness between logged-over and unlogged forest plots, while stem density was higher in the latter (421 ± 153 stems ha-1). Greater BA was found in unlogged forests (30.28 ± 4.45 m2 ha-1) of the H type when compared to the logged-over stands (15.52 ± 4.04 m2 ha-1). We detected positive trends in richness (0.55 ± 0.19 taxa ha-1 yr-1) and diversity after logging. Furthermore, H type forest exhibited positive trends in stem density (9 ± 1 stems ha-1 yr-1) and BA (0.42 ± 0.06 m2 ha-1 yr-1) with elapsed time since harvesting. Our analysis highlights some significant effects of logging activities on biodiversity and structure of PNG forests. Additionally, forests exhibited a significant recovery with respect to richness, diversity and stand structure. These preliminary results will be compared with data collected by the forthcoming National Forest Inventory in order to assess and monitor the effects of human activities and ecological factors on PNG forest biodiversity and develop appropriate conservation measures and sustainable management strategies. © SISEF.","Basal area; Biodiversity; Multivariate analysis; National forest inventory; Papua new guinea; Permanent sample plots; REDD+; Selective logging","Testolin, R.; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, V.le delle Terme di Caracalla, Italy; email: riccardo.testolin@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970939138

However, there remains considerable uncertainty as to whether tropical forests will continue to act as carbon sinks in the face of increased pressure from expanding human activities. Consequently, understanding what drives productivity in tropical forests is critical. We used permanent forest plot data from the Gola Rainforest National Park (Sierra Leone) – one of the largest tracts of intact tropical moist forest in West Africa – to explore how (1) stand basal area and tree diversity, (2) past disturbance associated with past logging, and (3) underlying soil nutrient gradients interact to determine rates of aboveground wood production (AWP). We started by statistically modeling the diameter growth of individual trees and used these models to estimate AWP for 142 permanent forest plots. We then used structural equation modeling to explore the direct and indirect pathways which shape rates of AWP. Across the plot network, stand basal area emerged as the strongest determinant of AWP, with densely packed stands exhibiting the fastest rates of AWP. In addition to stand packing density, both tree diversity and soil phosphorus content were also positively related to productivity. By contrast, historical logging activities negatively impacted AWP through the removal of large trees, which contributed disproportionately to productivity. Understanding what determines variation in wood production across tropical forest landscapes requires accounting for multiple interacting drivers – with stand structure, tree diversity, and soil nutrients all playing a key role. Importantly, our results also indicate that logging activities can have a long-lasting impact on a forest's ability to sequester and store carbon, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding old-growth tropical forests. © 2016 The Authors.

This study investigates the extent to which human disturbance to natural ecosystems facilitates the spread of non-native species, focusing on a small mammal community in selectively logged rain forest, Sabah, Borneo. The microhabitat preferences of the invasive Rattus rattus and three native species of small mammal were examined in three-dimensional space by combining the spool-and-line technique with a novel method for quantifying fine-scale habitat selection. These methods allowed the detection of significant differences for each species between the microhabitats used compared with alternative, available microhabitats that were avoided. Rattus rattus showed the greatest preference for heavily disturbed habitats, and in contrast to two native small mammals of the genus Maxomys, R. rattus showed high levels of arboreal behavior, frequently leaving the forest floor and traveling through the understory and midstory forest strata. This behavior may enable R. rattus to effectively utilize the complex three-dimensional space of the lower strata in degraded forests, which is characterized by dense vegetation. The behavioral flexibility of R. rattus to operate in both terrestrial and arboreal space may facilitate its invasion into degraded forests. Human activities that generate heavily disturbed habitats preferred by R. rattus may promote the establishment of this invasive species in tropical forests in Borneo, and possibly elsewhere. We present this as an example of a synergistic effect, whereby forest disturbance directly threatens biodiversity and indirectly increases the threat posed by invasive species, creating habitat conditions that facilitate the establishment of non-native fauna. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","Rattus rattus; Arboreality; Habitat preference; Invasion; Selective logging; Synergistic effects","Loveridge, R.; Department of Life Sciences, Silwood Park Campus, Buckhurst Road, United Kingdom; email: robin.loveridge@googlemail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959048562

Alterations to natural disturbance regimes, such as those brought about by logging, have the potential to shift relative species abundances and the community composition of forests, resulting in population declines for commercially valuable species. Timber operations therefore need to minimise such changes if long-term sustainability is to be achieved within the industry. Reduced-impact logging (RIL) has been promoted widely as an alternative management strategy to conventional selective logging, as it employs practices that decrease the negative impacts of logging within forests. However, the long-term sustainability of RIL, including the influence it has on the regeneration of species targeted for timber extraction, is still uncertain. Here we undertake a comparative study in Iwokrama forest, Guyana, examining seedling densities of four commercially valuable and two pioneer tree species in unlogged, 1.5 years and 4.5 years postharvest forest plots to ascertain how seedling regeneration is effected by RIL. We find that RIL had either a neutral or positive impact on the density of seedlings of timber species when compared to unlogged forest, with pioneer species densities remaining rare. We conclude that the forestry practices associated with RIL have little effect on the natural regeneration rates of key commercially valuable tree species in logged neotropical forests. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Forest disturbance; Guyana; Regeneration; RIL; Sustainable forestry; Timber","Bicknell, J.E.; Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (DICE), United Kingdom; email: J.E.Bicknell@kent.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958987623

Knowledge on the impacts of these hazards on forest structure and dynamics has been compiled in empirical studies. However, the results of these studies are often not sufficient for long-term projections and extrapolations to large spatial scales especially for unprecedented environmental conditions, which require both the identification and understanding of key underlying processes. Forest models bridge this gap by incorporating multiple ecological processes in a dynamic framework (i.e. including a realistic model structure) and addressing the complexity of forest ecosystems. Here, we describe the evolution of the individual-based and process-based forest gap model FORMIND and its application to tropical forests. At its core, the model includes physiological processes on tree level (photosynthesis, respiration, tree growth, mortality, regeneration, competition). During the past two decades, FORMIND has been used to address various scientific questions arising from different forest types by continuously extending the model structure. The model applications thus provided understanding in three main aspects: (1) the grouping of single tree species into plant functional types is a successful approach to reduce complexity in vegetation models, (2) structural realism was necessary to analyze impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as logging, fragmentation, or drought, and (3) complex ecological processes such as carbon fluxes in tropical forests - starting from the individual tree level up to the entire forest ecosystem - can be explored as a function of forest structure, species composition and disturbance regime. Overall, this review shows how the evolution of long-term modelling projects not only provides scientific understanding of forest ecosystems, but also provides benefits for ecological theory and empirical study design. © 2015 The Authors.","Carbon balance; Disturbance; Forest simulations; FORMIND; Species richness; Structural realism","Fischer, R.; Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research GmbH-UFZ, Permoserstr. 15, Germany; email: rico.fischer@ufz.de",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961159772

Forest ecosystem, which is an integral part of terrestrial ecosystems, can play a significant role in absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and aiding global climate change mitigation, subsequently contributing to meet the national commitment and demand of carbon emission reduction and carbon sink enhancement. Afforestation and reforestation, as recognized in the Kyoto Protocol, provide relatively low-cost and effective solutions to enhance forest ecosystem carbon sink. Meanwhile, the carbon sequestration capacity of a forest ecosystem is enormously affected by various natural and anthropogenic factors, which may convert the forest ecosystem from a carbon sink to a source. Therefore, the understanding of the influence of afforestation, reforestation, and those factors on the carbon sequestration capacity of the forest ecosystem is important for the accurate estimation of global and regional forest ecosystem carbon budget. In this study, the recent research progresses on the effect of afforestation and reforestation on carbon sequestration capacity of global and regional forest has been reviewed, along with the influence of several natural and anthropogenic disturbances (i.e., forest logging, climate change, CO2 concentration enhancement, fire, and insect). It was indicated that the carbon sequestration capacity of global afforestation and reforestation was in the range of 148 to 2400 TgC/a, varying regionally as follows: tropical forest (1700 TgC/a) &gt; boreal forest (700 TgC/a) &gt; temperate forest (27-500 TgC/a). Furthermore, besides climate change and CO2 concentration rise, other factors that caused carbon emissions in the forest have been summed up and listed below. Forest logging caused the highest carbon emissions (900 TgC/a), followed by forest fire (300 TgC/a), and insects caused the lowest carbon emissions (2-107 TgC/a). Henceforth, more attention should be paid on the influence of carbon sequestration measures and integrated effects of multiple forms of disturbance on the carbon sequestration capacity of forest ecosystems, especially carbon sequestration capacity of forest soil. Furthermore, controlling forest logging and fire, along with reducing or avoiding additional carbon leakage due to afforestation and reforestation would also greatly contribute to forest carbon sequestration. © 2016, Ecological Society of China.

We compared the two systems on the basis of productivity and stand damage in forests that were selectively logged at the same intensity on slopes ≤ 40% for bulldozer and for mono-cable yarding on slopes ≤55%. On slopes ≤40%, bulldozers yarded an average of 10.3 m3 hm-1 hour-1 to roadside log landings whereas mono-cable winch productivity was 7.8 m3 hm-1 hour-1.

Detecting and mapping logging impacts on forest structure is a primary conservation concern, as these impacts feed through to changes in biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Here, we test whether high-spatial resolution satellite remote sensing can be used to map the responses of aboveground live tree biomass (AGB), canopy leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FCover) to selective logging and deforestation in Malaysian Borneo. We measured these attributes in permanent vegetation plots in rainforest and oil palm plantations across the degradation landscape of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project. We found significant mathematical relationships between field-measured structure and satellite-derived spectral and texture information, explaining up to 62% of variation in biophysical structure across forest and oil palm plots. These relationships held at different aggregation levels from plots to forest disturbance types and oil palms allowing us to map aboveground biomass and canopy structure across the degradation landscape. The maps reveal considerable spatial variation in the impacts of previous logging, a pattern that was less clear when considering field data alone. Up-scaled maps revealed a pronounced decline in aboveground live tree biomass with increasing disturbance, impacts which are also clearly visible in the field data even a decade after logging. Field data demonstrate a rapid recovery in forest canopy structure with the canopy recovering to pre-disturbance levels a decade after logging.

We did a meta-analysis to summarise the effect of logging on the abundance of individual bird and mammal species in tropical forests of Borneo, which have suffered some of the most intense selective logging in the tropics. We found that species classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as 'vulnerable' or 'near-threatened' are generally less abundant in logged tropical forests than those classified as 'least concern'. However, the effect of logging within each IUCN category is variable, indicating that logging is not the only or main cause of decline in abundance. While our results show that closely related species responded similarly to logging, in birds there was significant variation between responses of some closely related species. Bigger species were significantly more susceptible to logging than smaller species in both birds and mammals. We also found that cavity-nesting birds suffered more from logging than did other species. Our results highlight the importance of identifying which factors lead individual species to flourish or suffer in logged tropical forests. © 2016 The Authors.","Biodiversity; IUCN; Logging; Rainforests; Silviculture; Vertebrates","Costantini, D.; Department of Biology, Universiteitsplein 1, Belgium; email: davidcostantini@libero.it",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959344461

The synergetic effects of habitat loss and fragmentation might lead to profound impacts on forest structure and composition, conducting forest fragments towards early successional stages (retrogressive succession). In this study, we tested this hypothesis by evaluating how landscape-scale forest loss affects the forest structure. We sampled forest structure descriptors in 40 forest sites in landscapes ranging from 3 to 100% forest cover. Forest cover was negatively related to most of the structural variables, generally in a non-linear manner. In contrast, dead trees and logging were ubiquitous and not related to forest cover. The forest remnants in more deforested landscapes retain early successional forest attributes, with tree assemblages that are less dense, shorter, thinner, with an overall basal area loss, and with increasing canopy openness. This structural degradation indicates that landscape-scale forest loss strongly determines the trajectory of the local forest structure, pushing forests to a retrogressive succession process, which is more likely to occur in deforested landscapes and can lead to functional forest erosion. Our findings indicate that remnants within deforested landscapes may suffer recruitment limitation, primarily of large trees. Additionally, the forest structure characteristics were more severely degraded in landscapes with less than 40% forest cover. In the face of these results, the recommendation is to avoid the reduction of forest cover below this threshold, at which point structural erosion becomes more severe, with predictable negative consequences on biodiversity and ecosystem service maintenance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Extinction threshold; Habitat loss; Landscape changes; Retrogressive succession; Tree community; Tropical forest","Cazetta, E.; PPG Ecologia e Conservação da Biodiversidade, Brazil; email: eliana.cazetta@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956897857

We mapped 937 ha of logging infrastructure in a selectively harvested tropical forest to inform a scalable approach to measuring the impacts of discrete management practices (hauling, skidding, and felling). We used a lidar-derived disturbance model to map all skid trails and haul roads within 26 months of the selective harvest of six blocks of dipterocarp forest in five industrial concessions in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Lidar maps of logging impacts (220 ha) agreed well with ground-based maps (total of 217 ha, RMS error of 6 ha or 3%), but skid trail positions agreed only 59% of the time. Due to rapid forest regeneration, total lidar-derived haul road area was 31% smaller than road area measured in the field; agreement was higher for lidar collections within a year of the harvest. Maps of carbon density generated from Fourier transforms of lidar height profiles estimated skidding and felling biomass losses to within 1-5% of ground-based measurements. Lidar-derived skidding and hauling impact zones covered only 69% of the permitted harvest area; the remaining areas showed no signs of logging disturbance, and available biophysical data did not explain their location. These results emphasize the need for more extensive mapping of logging infrastructure to capture spatial variability in skid trail density and hitherto undetected no-impact zones. While a ground-based GPS is recommended as the most affordable method for wide-scale infrastructure mapping, aerial lidar is an effective tool for remotely quantifying the extent of logging impacts in tropical forests. © 2016 The Authors.","Biomass map; Carbon emissions; Lidar; Logging infrastructure; Reduced impact logging","Ellis, P.; The Nature Conservancy, 4245 Fairfax Drive, United States; email: pellis@tnc.org",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956698758

Aerial insectivorous bats are a highly diverse group that plays key roles in the ecology of rainforests, but their use of vertical space remains elusive. Using automatic ultrasound recording stations placed in the canopy, subcanopy and understorey we tested if bat activity and species diversity are vertically stratified, both in the forest interior and near the edges of water bodies. These patterns were tested separately for individual species, and for two functional groups - open space and edge space bats. Insectivorous bat activity increased by roughly seven fold, and species diversity doubled, from the understorey to the canopy. Both edge space and open space bats were more active in the upper strata, but this tendency was much more accentuated in the latter. Myotis riparius was the only species with greater activity near the understorey. These patterns were altered at the edges of water bodies, where vertical stratification was much less marked. The observed patterns are parsimoniously explained by constraints imposed by vegetation clutter that change across strata, which affect bat species differently. Only bats better adapted to closed spaces are usually capable of foraging within the understorey, whereas the majority of species can exploit the free spaces immediately below the canopy; open space bats seem to concentrate their activity above the canopy. This importance of the inter strata open spaces for bat foraging highlights the need to preserve pristine stratified rainforests, as even selective logging usually disrupts vertical stratification. Moreover, the concentration of insectivorous bats at the upper strata of rainforests underlines the need to include canopy level sampling in ecological studies. © 2016 Nordic Society Oikos.",,"Marques, J.T.; Depto de Biologia Animal, Portugal; email: jtiagomarques@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936984859

Within these forest ecosystems, the frugivore community contributes important ecological services through animal-mediated seed dispersal. However, there is no clear understanding of the impacts of logging on wildlife or of the extent to which seed dispersal is preserved in logged forests. Given its tendency for nesting in light gaps, the western lowland gorilla is likely to provide directed-dispersal services to a wide range of tree species. Production forests preserved from poaching have been reported to harbor high densities of gorillas, but the monitoring of gorilla populations subjected to logging is poorly documented. This study investigated gorilla density and nesting behavior after timber exploitation in a logging concession in southeast Gabon. Nest count censuses were performed on line transects, before and after the second felling cycle. Gorilla density dropped from 1.5 (116.7 nests km-2, 95% CI = 83.4-163.5) to 1.0 (64.9 nests km-2, % CI = 32.6-129.5) weaned gorilla km-2 4-6 months after logging, then rose to 2.6 (176.3 nests km-2, 95% CI = 113.5-274.1) gorillas km-2 9-11 months after logging. A consistent preference for nesting in open canopy terra firma forest was observed during all censuses. This study demonstrates the short-term resilience of the western lowland gorilla to selective timber harvesting, and argues that they offer a continued contribution to directed-dispersal services within months after logging. Although a long-term monitoring of gorillas in a logged forest should be undertaken, the role of this species in logged forest recovery is thought to be important. The preservation of gorilla should receive particular consideration by forest managers. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Density; Gabon; Gorilla gorilla gorilla; Line transects; Nesting behavior; Timber exploitation","Haurez, B.; Laboratory of Tropical Forestry, Passage des Déportés 2, Belgium; email: bhaurez@doct.ulg.ac.be",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956857142

This is less than the storage reported in a recent synthesis of AGB observations in mature tropical montane forests, potentially due to a legacy of selective logging within our study sites. The slope angle resulted in AGB being 1.5-10% greater when reported on a planimetric compared to land surface area basis. We also quantified AGB in areas of abandoned pasture where grazing and fire had been excluded. Pasture that had been recently abandoned (1-2years) stored 2-18Mgha-1 of AGB with the higher values due to the presence of relict trees. Re-growing secondary forests, established through natural regeneration, accumulated AGB at a rate of 10Mgha-1yr-1 at 1000 m elevation and 4Mgha-1yr-1 at 2250m elevation, for the first 5-7years after pasture abandonment. After 12-15 years, accumulation of AGB slowed to 1-2Mgha-1yr-1. Net biomass accumulation rates were similar to those observed in lowland humid tropical forests, suggesting that regenerating tropical montane forests provide an important carbon sequestration. In newly regenerating forests, small trees (DBH &lt; 10cm) contributed up to 50% of total AGB. In the older secondary forest at high elevation coarse dead wood contributed 34% of total AGB. © 2016 The Authors.","Biomass; Reforestation; Sequestration; Tropical montane forest","Spracklen, D.V.; School of Earth and Environment, United Kingdom; email: D.V.Spracklen@leeds.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954558035

Whether such changes modify interactions between species and the networks in which they are embedded remain fundamental questions to assess the ‘health’ and ecosystem functionality of logged forests. We focus on interactions between lianas and their tree hosts within primary and selectively logged forests in the biodiversity hotspot of Malaysian Borneo. We found that lianas were more abundant, had higher species richness, and different species compositions in logged than in primary forests. Logged forests showed heavier liana loads disparately affecting slowgrowing tree species, which could exacerbate the loss of timber value and carbon storage alreadyassociatedwith logging.Moreover, simulation scenarios of host tree local species loss indicated that logging might decrease the robustness of liana–tree interaction networks if heavily infested trees (i.e. the most connected ones)were more likely to disappear. This effect is partially mitigated in the short term by the colonization of host trees by a greater diversity of liana species within logged forests, yet this might not compensate for the loss of preferred tree hosts in the long term. As a consequence, species interaction networks may show a lagged response to disturbance, which may trigger sudden collapses in species richness and ecosystem function in response to additional disturbances, representing a new type of ‘extinction debt’. © 2016 The Authors.","Ecosystem functioning; Network structure; Selective logging; Southeast Asia; Tree–liana networks; Wood density","Magrach, A.; Institute of Terrestrial Ecosystems, CHN G 74.2 Universitätstrasse 16, Switzerland; email: ainhoamagrach@hotmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960145953

This is particularly relevant in tropical forests where natural population densities can be low and isolated trees may be subject to outcross pollen limitation and/or produce low-quality selfed seeds that exhibit inbreeding depression. Comparing reproductive biology processes and genetic diversity of populations at different densities can provide indirect evidence of the potential impacts of logging. Here, we analysed patterns of genetic diversity, mating system and gene flow in three Central African populations of the self-compatible legume timber species Erythrophleum suaveolens with contrasting densities (0.11, 0.68 and 1.72 adults per ha). The comparison of inbreeding levels among cohorts suggests that selfing is detrimental as inbred individuals are eliminated between seedling and adult stages. Levels of genetic diversity, selfing rates (∼16%) and patterns of spatial genetic structure (Sp ∼ 0.006) were similar in all three populations. However, the extent of gene dispersal differed markedly among populations: the average distance of pollen dispersal increased with decreasing density (from 200 m in the high-density population to 1000 m in the low-density one). Overall, our results suggest that the reproductive biology and genetic diversity of the species are not affected by current logging practices. However, further investigations need to be conducted in low-density populations to evaluate (1) whether pollen limitation may reduce seed production and (2) the regeneration potential of the species. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A growing proportion of tropical production forests are managed under Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) principles. The objective of SFM is to achieve multiple benefits, including forest protection, biodiversity conservation and income enhancement. However, the outcomes resulting from the implementation of SFM in tropical forest ecosystems have seldom been examined rigorously. In this paper, we present a methodological approach to assess broad-scale impacts of SFM policy in tropical forest ecosystems. As a case study, we investigated deforestation and timber production in logging concessions in the Republic of Congo after the implementation of its SFM-based forestry law in 2000. Compliance with the forestry law was incomplete, allowing a unique opportunity to compare deforestation and legal timber production outcomes in concessions that implemented SFM-based policy compared to those that did not. Quasi-experimental matching analysis indicated that deforestation in matched parcels in compliant concessions was up to 2-times higher than matched parcels in non-compliant concessions, equivalent to 67km2 of forest loss for the period 2005-2010. Annual deforestation data demonstrated that deforestation was stable or increased in all six concessions following the respective date of compliance in each concession. Legal timber production increased (by 5%, from 0.18 to 0.19 CBM/ha/yr) and became more stable, in compliant compared to non-compliant concessions. Our results suggest that the presence of SFM in a concession does not immediately lead to less deforestation. Rather, SFM policy may be associated with higher deforestation, because SFM is also associated with higher legal timber production, foreign capital, and international timber demand. Our findings measure short-term associations between SFM and deforestation in the Congo, and underscore the need for empirical evaluation of long-term impacts of SFM in tropical forest ecosystems worldwide. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Avoided deforestation; Conservation success; Counterfactual; FSC certification; Impact assessment; Logging concessions; Reduced-impact logging (RIL); Sustainable forestry","Brandt, J.S.; Human-Environment Systems Initiative, United States; email: jodibrandt@boisestate.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949871287

To address this, here we identified using linear mixed models the effect of proximal (diet, activity pattern, hunting and logging) and distal (sum of the basal areas of fruiting-tree species [SBAFS], landscape forest cover and degree of forest fragmentation) variables over fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) levels-hormones associated with animal health and fitness-of six groups of spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) inhabiting six landscapes with different spatial structures in Mexico. Proximal variables showed a stronger predictive power over fGCMs than distal. In this sense, increases in travel time, the occurrence of hunting, and reductions in rest time and fruit consumption resulted in higher fGCM levels. Regarding distal variables, increases in SBAFS were negatively related to fGCM levels, thus suggesting that food scarcity increases stress hormone levels. Nevertheless, contrary to theoretical expectations, spider monkeys living in smaller tracts of forest spent less time travelling, but the same time feeding on fruit as those in more forested areas. The lower net energy return associated with this combination of factors would explain why, contrary to theoretical expectations, increased forest cover was associated with increased levels of fGCMs in these groups. Our study shows that, at least in the short term, spider monkeys in fragmented landscapes do not always present higher levels of stress hormones compared to those inhabiting continuous forest, and the importance of preserving fruit sources and controlling hunting for reducing the levels of stress hormones in free ranging spider monkeys. © 2016 Ordóñez-Gómez et al.

In this context, we assessed the magnitude of the impact of selective logging on the SOC levels in three chronosequences in Ghana, Cameroon and Gabon. Methods: In each chronosequence, from unlogged forest to forest that was selectively logged at different times in the past, adjacent plots were investigated by sampling the soil at various depths to 1 m. Results: Both SOC concentrations and stocks drastically decrease after selective logging in all sites. The 0–5 cm depth represents the layer with the most evident SOC decreases, particularly in the first and second decades after selective logging. The SOC loss is later stabilised, but the C levels remain lower than those of the unlogged forest 45–50 years after selective logging. Conclusions: In all the investigated chronosequences, the SOC levels are strongly affected by selective logging and the soils continue losing C for many years. In conclusion, SOC measurements should be used to provide precise C emission-removal estimates also for forests managed using sustainable management practices. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Soil organic carbon; Soil organic carbon change rate; Tropical forests, selective logging","Chiti, T.; Department for Innovation in Biological, via San C.

However, methods for mapping and monitoring pan-tropical forest degradation are still in their infancy. Here we present a new and automated approach to differentiate forests likely to be affected by degradation dynamics from more structurally intact forests, referred to as hinterland forests. Location: Pan-tropical. Methods: Inputs required for hinterland forest mapping include the extent of the initial forest cover and subsequent forest cover loss data, in this case global-scale Landsat-derived tree cover and stand-replacement disturbance maps. User-defined parameters employed to generate the extent and change of hinterland forest include: (1) minimum size of hinterland forest patch, (2) minimum corridor width, (3) distance from disturbance, and (4) extant history. Results: Hinterland forest extent was mapped using forest cover loss data from 2000 to 2012 and hinterland forest loss was quantified from 2007 to 2013. Lidar-modelled forest height data were shown to be different within and outside hinterland forests, demonstrating the biophysical basis of the hinterland concept in discriminating likely degradation. Overall, hinterland forests experienced an 18% decline from 2007 to 2013. Regional variation in hinterland forest extent and loss was high. Data on 2013 pan-tropical hinterland forest extent can be downloaded from http://glad.geog.umd.edu/hinterland/index.html and viewed online at http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest. Main conclusions: The largest extent of hinterland forests and of hinterland forest loss was found in Latin America, followed by Africa and Southeast Asia, respectively. The highest proportional loss of hinterland forest occurred in Southeast Asia, followed by Africa and Latin America, respectively. Nearly 95% of all 2013 hinterland forests were found in 17 of the 69 tropical forest countries studied. The extent and loss of hinterland forest can be an input to national monitoring and management programmes focused on forest carbon stocks, biodiversity conservation and other ecosystem services. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Automated mapping; Forest degradation; Forest loss maps; Hinterland forests; Intact forests; Tropical forests","Tyukavina, A.; Department of Geographical Sciences, 4321 Hartwick Road, Suite 400, United States; email: atyukav@umd.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953370362

These disturbances often create small patches of successional vegetation and heterogeneous spatial patterns. Airborne LiDAR can detect small-scale disturbances, which are undetectable by conventional remote sensing. Here, our aim was to evaluate the similarity in community composition of tree assemblages after human disturbances in a tropical rainforest in northern Borneo using small-footprint airborne LiDAR. We derived 16 variables related to the height distribution and canopy characteristics from airborne LiDAR data. The similarity in community composition among plots was calculated using ordination analysis (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) based on the number of trees of each species. LiDAR-derived variables were significantly correlated with the similarity in community composition; the strongest correlation was with the canopy laser penetration rate down to 1-m height above ground (rs=-0.81, p&lt;0.001). The predictive model for similarity in community composition developed using the canopy laser penetration rate at 0-m height and the maximum height had R2adj=0.71 (p&lt;0.001). We applied this equation to the entire study area and compared the output with the human disturbance histories. A predictive map based on the equation suggested that the similarity in community composition changes in proportion to the degree of human disturbances. Our findings indicate that the similarity attributed to human disturbances in tropical forests can be predicted and monitored by means of airborne LiDAR.

However, the climate sensitivity of this ecosystem remains uncertain: several studies have predicted large-scale dieback of the Amazon, whereas several more recent studies predict that the biome will remain largely intact. Combining remote-sensing and ground-based observations with a size- and age-structured terrestrial ecosystem model, we explore the sensitivity and ecological resilience of these forests to changes in climate. We demonstrate that water stress operating at the scale of individual plants, combined with spatial variation in soil texture, explains observed patterns of variation in ecosystem biomass, composition, and dynamics across the region, and strongly influences the ecosystem's resilience to changes in dry season length. Specifically, our analysis suggests that in contrast to existing predictions of either stability or catastrophic biomass loss, the Amazon forest's response to a drying regional climate is likely to be an immediate, graded, heterogeneous transition from high-biomass moist forests to transitional dry forests and woody savannah-like states. Fire, logging, and other anthropogenic disturbances may, however, exacerbate these climate change-induced ecosystem transitions.","Amazon forests; Biomass; Climate change; Ecological resilience; Ecosystem heterogeneity","Moorcroft, P.R.; Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, United States; email: paul_moorcroft@harvard.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955253213

To evaluate these effects on forest regeneration processes is of critical importance, since reduced impact logging (RIL) has been advocated as a potential tool for conservation. We describe the abiotic alterations caused by selective logging and examine the effect of disturbances on the abundance and performance of seedlings of seven trees species. To test long-term effects we evaluated the regeneration process in a chronosequence spanning 11-years after logging in which 144 plots were sampled, representing an area of 300,000. ha in the central Amazonia. Seedling performance was affected by habitat alterations caused by logging. Growth is enhanced in logged sites for up to three years after logging for all species. However, in five out of seven species, the mortality rates found in logged were higher than the ones in control sites up to 11. years after logging. For most species the presence of a seed source is the most important factor determining the number of regenerating individuals. This effect of dispersal limitation on seedlings can affect tree regeneration on logged areas, since no rules limit the number of individuals per species that can be harvested per hectare. Demographic responses to abiotic alterations resulting from selective logging affect tree species regeneration patterns, and in a long term can influence the structure of tropical forest communities. We concluded that over time the habitat becomes less suitable for species regeneration on logged areas. These results indicate that RIL can have more effects on tree regeneration than previously supposed. Methods to minimize these effects (mainly on survivorship rates) should be considered in future management plans. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Amazonia; Disturbance; Logging; Regeneration; Seed limitation; Trade-off growth mortality rates; Tropical forest","Darrigo, M.R.; Instituto de Biologia, Bloco O.

Recovery is typically evaluated or monitored by using a few easily identified species groups, but this may not be sufficient as unmonitored groups of equivalent ecological importance are unlikely to respond in a similar manner due to physiological or dispersal differences. Aims: We compared four groups of plants: large trees, shrubs and saplings, herbs and ferns in a forest recovering from disturbance. We quantified the relative importance of disturbance history and local environmental conditions in determining species richness and community composition of these groups and assessed whether the groups could act as surrogate indicators for one another. Methods: Vegetation was surveyed on a gradient of disturbance intensity and recovery time (20–60 years) in Mabira Forest, Uganda. We looked for correlations between species groups in richness or composition across sites and used constrained ordinations to identify important environmental variables. Results: Neither species richness nor composition patterns were correlated between groups. All groups were weakly related to disturbance history; trees and shrubs were related to soil, herbs to microhabitat and ferns to microclimate. Conclusions: No group acted as an indicator for another. The relative influence of disturbance and local environmental effects varied in the manner predicted, with disturbance stronger for trees and environment stronger for ferns. © 2016 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.","dispersal; fern; herb; microclimate; microhabitat; pteridophyte; restoration; surrogate; tree; vegetation","Eycott, A.E.; Department of Biology, Norway; email: amy.eycott@uib.no",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964467504

As particular species of plants are targeted for provisioning services, such as commercial logging, the implications for other ecosystem services are often unknown. In this paper we drew on the traditional knowledge of the Makushi and Wapishiana Amerindians of Southern Guyana, and multiple-use plants to gauge the ecosystem services that may be compromised as tropical forests undergo change. An inventory of tree and palm species was classified into one or more of four resource-use classes: commercial timber, wildlife food, traditional uses or no known use. Species that intersected more than one resource use were defined as multiple-use species, and occupied four primary classes – wildlife food/commercial timber, commercial timber/traditional uses, wildlife food/traditional uses and wildlife food/commercial timber/traditional uses.

A body condition scoring system was created for the Bornean banteng using camera trap photographs from five forests in Sabah, Malaysia, with various past and present management combinations to establish if banteng nutrition suffered as a result of forest disturbance. Results One hundred and eleven individuals were photographed over 38,009 camera trap nights from April 2011 to June 2014 in five forests. Banteng within forests that had a recent history of reduced-impact logging had higher body condition scores than banteng within conventionally logged forest. Conversely, when past logging was conducted using a conventional technique and the period of forest regeneration was relatively long; the banteng had higher body condition scores. Conclusion The body condition scoring system is appropriate for monitoring the long-term nutrition of the Bornean banteng and for evaluating the extent of the impact caused by present-day reduced-impact logging methods. Reduced-impact logging techniques give rise to individuals with the higher body condition scores in the shorter term, which then decline over time. In contrast the trend is opposite for conventional logging, which demonstrates the complex effects of logging on banteng body condition scores. This is likely to be due to differences in regeneration between forests that have been previously logged using differing methods. © The Author(s) 2016.","Body condition scoring; Camera trap; Habitat degradation; Reduced-impact logging; Sabah; Tropical forest","Prosser, N.S.; Danau Girang Field Centre, Wisma Muis, Malaysia; email: N.Prosser@warwick.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045058653

However, this is a misconception that can be attributed to inadequate knowledge of actual forest conditions on the one hand, and to the conflation of logging and agricultural clearance on the other hand. This article, written by a practitioner with a thorough knowledge of the tropical forest context, sets out to assess the impacts of logging on dense tropical rainforests in Africa and South America. In the interests of accuracy, the article distinguishes between the different phases of a logging operation: establishment of the base camp, building of logging roads to ship out the timber and actual felling. Different scenarios are described according to the richness of forest environments, where harvested volumes vary from 3 to 15 m3/ha. These estimations confirm that the destruction of forest cover is so low that, except in radical situations, logging is not a threat to the sustainability of tropical forests. Opening up road networks and logging roads affects 4.5% to 5.5% of forest cover. Clear-felled areas never exceed 4% of the forest cover and the figure drops to less than 2% in highly or moderately species-rich forests. Logging is therefore directly responsible for only 5.5% to 8.5% of forest destruction. Although the figure can rise to 12% to 16% in rich forest environments, it does not take into account the natural dynamics of biomass reconstitution between logging sequences.

In Quintana Roo, Mexico, abandoned slash-and-burn cropfields are excellent candidates for seedling establishment, but an efficient way to establish mahogany seedlings has not been identified. This study assessed the probability of predation on directly sown mahogany seeds, examining the effects of three treatments (four types of seed protection, two sowing methods, two times of day for sowing). The mean percentage of seeds either partially consumed or removed during a 12-hour period varied from 1.1 to 7.7% among the four seed protection treatments and did not differ between the two sowing methods. Precipitation had an important positive effect on survival, and minimum daily temperature had a marginal negative effect on survival. The Julian calendar date had a positive effect on seed survival. Seed predation did not differ among the seed protection treatments that allowed access only to rodents, only to insects, and to both types of seed predators, and predation was greater with these three treatments than with the no-access treatment. Seed predation was not influenced by the time of day of sowing. Direct sowing offers a good option for regenerating mahogany, especially if the mahogany seeds are soaked for at least 2 weeks before sowing to reduce predation risks and increase prospects for seed survival and seedling establishment.","Mahogany; Mexico; Regeneration; Seed predation; Silviculture; Swietenia macrophylla; Tropical forest","Mize, C.W.; Iowa State University, United States; email: carlmize@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030751857

As a global response to stem further tropical forest degradation, there was the valorization of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) as a viable means of enhancing the lives of the burgeoning forest-adjacent communities by the international community. This paper examines the contribution of NTFPs exploitation to poverty alleviation in the Fako-Meme Forest region as well as the nexus between NTFPs exploitation and forest conservation. This has been based on the consultation of secondary data relating to the types, quantities and incomes derived from NTFPs as a replacement of timber exploitation. These have been supported by primary data obtained from field surveys involving interviews and observations. Findings of the study show that forest dependent communities are significantly involved in the exploitation and commercialization of NTFPs. This is more so because of a wider market which ensued with regional integration in the Central African sub-region alongside neighbouring Nigeria due to improvements in transportation and their proximity to Cameroon. However, the exploitation of these NTFPs is done largely in unsustainable basis thus equally contributing to further forest degradation. This is accounted for by the extensive market and the continuous growth in the populations of these areas as they must excessively exploit NFTPs in order to survive. This therefore calls to question, the introduction and valorization of NTFPs exploitation as an alternative source of livelihood in optimizing forest conservation as opposed to timber exploitation which was identified as a major determinant of forest degradation. Overall, the exploitation of NTFPs slows down forest degradation when compared to timber exploitation. However, as long as these populations keep growing, NTFPs will continue to be incapable of sustainably alleviating poverty. In recognition of this scenario, this study, while recommending the need to control the human population in the long run, in the meantime, it is necessary for all actors to revisit their poverty alleviating strategies in these communities which are centred on the exploitation of NTFPs. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Forest conservation; Meme divisions of Cameroon; NTFPs","Emmanuel Sunjo, T.; Department of Geography, Cameroon; email: tataemmanuel@ymail.com",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030213292

Given the prevalence of logging in tropical forests around the world, effective road management is of crucial importance to reduce both logging- related environmental impacts and the costs of logging operations. Through a review of the literature, our study analysed how logging roads have been addressed in scientific articles to date. We compared studies published over the past 65 years in the Bois et Forêts des Tropiques journal (BFT), mostly written in French, with a range of more recent articles from the Scopus and Web of Knowledge databases. Half of the articles in BFT were published before 1972, while the more generalist databases show a steady increase in publications on the subject since then, up to the current peak number. From the entire body of literature, we selected 126 articles dealing with impacts and management of logging roads in tropical forests around the world for critical appraisal. The BFT articles were characterized by a strong focus on practical issues in forest road engineering, while the focus of many publications written in English was on the identification of road impacts on forest ecosystems. Road-related environmental impacts stem from the loss of forest cover during construction, the increase in edge effects, soil erosion and interference with wildlife, as well as from the resulting easier access to the forest for hunting and agricultural colonization. Based on this review, we present a list of recommended measures to reduce these impacts. We conclude that, despite the continuing attention given to the subject of logging roads, little is known about how they evolve in the forest landscape over the long term.","Biodiversity conservation; Forest degradation; Low-impact logging; Road ecology; Selective logging; Soils; Sustainable forest management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028800098

Commercial timber extraction is believed to be the main driver of degradation in tropical forests. Currently, production forests cover more area than protected forests. In addition, most of the remaining forests are designated for timber production by national forest services. Therefore, the forests remaining after selective logging will play important roles in maintaining and upgrading ecosystem services such as maintenance of carbon stocks and biodiversity in degraded tropical forests. Degraded forest structure and species composition caused by selective logging may be recovered through secondary forest succession. However, it remains unclear how long it takes tropical forests to recover from selective logging. This paper addresses this question from the viewpoints of forest structure, forest illumination, demographic parameters, biomass and tree biodiversity, using data derived from the Pasoh Forest Reserve, Malaysia where selective logging was performed in the 1950s. After selective logging the forest structure, forest illumination, and demographic parameters of this forest were still statistically distinguishable from unlogged forests even 50 years after a logging operation. Forest biomass had almost recovered to the pre-logging level 50 years after the logging operation concluded. However, after logging the biodiversity of the logged forest was quite different from that of the unlogged forest, suggesting that it will take quite a long time—more than 60 years—for biodiversity to recover after logging. © 2016, Tohoku University.

This chapter defines (framework) convention and protocol and describes how the processes have been used as an approach of international law making. This chapter deals with forest loss due to deforestation and forest degradation as an international problem and argues for an international framework of action as a global solution.

Despite the scores of international negotiations and initiatives on sustainable forest management (SFM) and forest-related issue areas like climate change, biological diversity, and illegal logging and associated trade, deforestation and forest degradation continue at an alarming rate. This chapter reviews the international processes in tropical forestry from Stockholm to Rio, post-UNCED intergovernmental processes, regional processes for SFM, and initiatives supporting the legality in and governance of the forest sector. The chapter concludes that due to the global nature of forest problem and lower effectiveness and political realism of the fragmented forest regime, the need for an international high-level forest policy forum - the Missing Fourth Convention of Rio - is stronger than ever. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.","Deforestation; Forest convention; Forest degradation; Illegal logging; International processes on forests; Regional processes on forests; Sustainable development; Sustainable forest management; Tropical forests; United nations conference on environment and development","Schneider, T.; University of Hamburg, Germany; email: thomas.schneider@ti.bund.de",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017653804

Forest harvesting refers to cutting and delivering trees in a productive, safe, economic, and ecological process. It includes the conversion of trees into merchantable raw material according to specific industrial or individual requirements and needs. In general, the wood passes through several processing steps before it can be transported. The most important operations are felling, delimbing, debarking, bucking, chipping, wood extraction, piling, loading, and wood transport. Depending on the qualitative demand, environmental and social restrictions, technological know-how, and access to technologies, some of the steps might be skipped. Also, the sequence of the processing may vary, going that far that the full tree is transported and processed at a central log yard. In the tropics, a variety of forest ecosystems can be found. From dry savanna to evergreen tropical rainforests, big differences exist in biodiversity, wood volume produced per area, soils, and climate. No matter what forest ecosystem is intended to be managed, they are all very sensitive and may be easily degraded or destroyed. On the other hand, there are many tropical regions with climatic conditions favorable to tree growth. It has to be differentiated between native tropical forests, generally managed in form of exploitation, and intensively managed forest plantations. While selective logging in native forests has to be done extremely careful considering many restrictions concerning mechanization of the harvesting process, in forest plantation in general, high volumes are produced in short rotations and harvested in fully mechanized clearcuts, because soil disturbance can be corrected before new planting. Forest harvesting has the highest ecologic and economic impact of all forest operations. It has to be thoroughly planned and executed to avoid damages on the ecosystem and putting at risk sustainability issues of the forest-wood chain. Planning of harvesting occurs in several planning levels, starting from a macroscale considering the general issues like volumes and areas, forest access, or transport up to an individual microscale planning on the single stand. The base of all planning is detailed inventories, consisting of quantitative and qualitative data of natural resources, road systems, technologies available, and logistic capacity of the company or forest owner. With these databases and a geographical information system, powerful planning tools might be developed for optimizing harvesting and transport operations. One of the most important steps concerning harvesting is cost planning of machine and labor cost. In general, wood harvesting is a very labor- and machine-intensive activity. Depending on the wood utilization, in this planning step, the cost calculation often shows that the harvesting operation is too expensive and can’t be conducted in an economic feasible way. At least, the forest road system or other transport means have to be carefully evaluated and planned, too. Transport distance and infrastructure are key issues in harvesting planning. This chapter aims to give an overview about the important issues to consider for the harvest process and highlights how complex the overall harvesting operations are. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.","Forest plantation; Harvesting operations; Harvesting planning; Harvesting process; Native forest; Wood transport","Malinovski, J.R.; Malinovski FlorestalBrazil; email: jorge@malinovski.com.br",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017652974

Ecological restoration is a growing field that combines forestry skills with ecological knowledge. Tropical forest management must also respond to the twin needs for climate-change mitigation (by reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing sinks) and adaptation (by maximizing the ability of forest species and ecosystems to adapt to climate change).

The different process steps of harvesting operations are felling, delimbing, debarking, bucking, off-road transport of the wood, and loading. Specifically in tropical countries, the resources, equipment, and machines that can be used are manifold and can be composed in complex systems. The climate conditions, soil properties, and human resources have to be considered in the choice of the equipment or machine used in each single process step of harvesting operations. Many tropical countries are even today facing a lack of financial resources for using their forests in a competitive and sustainable way. Harvesting in native tropical forests faces the following problems: trees of big dimension, low volume per ha, diversified assortments in species, length and diameter, sensitive soils where no mechanical or chemical corrections are possible, many environmental restrictions, and difficult access. The financial situation, technical know-how, and machine availability have impact on the volume and assortments that can be produced in harvesting operations. Logging companies with better financial background are able to mechanize many harvesting processes and increase productivity and working safety this way. They are able to create a net of forest roads to facilitate forest operations and to use adequate machines and equipment that allow also to extract big and heavy logs of high value. Smallholders or communities on the other hand are still relying on simple tools and equipment, animal-assisted skidding, and manual or motor-manual work in wood harvesting operations. In general they face strict limitations concerning the size of the trees that can be felled and the logs that can be skidded. In tropical forest plantations, the conditions found are quite different. In general only one or two species are planted, the stands are homogeneous in height and diameter, dimensions of the trees are smaller, the forest is planned and provides good access, and high volumes per hectare are harvested in clear-cut systems. All these utilization conditions are favorable to a higher degree of mechanization, since the economic returns are higher and faster in short rotation plantations. Smaller properties as well as industrial plantation owner work with adapted agricultural tractors or specific forestry machines, which allow high productivity with acceptable environmental impact. The present chapter gives an overview on the existing methods, equipment, and machines that are available for harvesting operations in tropical countries. It focuses on the description of the use and suitability of the equipment for the different process steps of harvesting operations. The permanent technical innovation in the sector makes it difficult to present always the technical specification of the newest existing machines on the markets.

It includes the conversion of trees into merchantable raw material according to specific industrial or individual requirements and needs. The combination of different technologies, machines, and labor force of the single processing steps of a harvesting operation to a harmonic and efficient production chain is the big challenge of a productive harvesting system. Wood harvesting has become an important science and operational factor all over the world in the last decades. In the framework of sustainable forest management, it is one of the key issues where the human impact on using natural resources like forest ecosystems can be reduced. Specifically in tropical countries, the forest ecosystems are very sensitive to any kind of human intervention. In native tropical forest as well as in tropical and subtropical forest plantations, the principles of reduced impact logging (RIL) are regarded as the most critical factor for economic, ecologic, and social sustainability (FAO 2004). Most of the negative image of tropical forest management comes from inappropriate harvesting methods with catastrophic environmental impact. Conventional logging systems (CL) did not take into consideration any sustainability matter, since the objective was always to make fast money and move on to the next exploitation site. In a long-term careful planning, harvesting operations can reduce costs, avoid environmental degradation, improve the utilization of the natural resources, and prevent the injury to personnel. Selecting the most appropriated harvesting system for a given silvicultural management system, terrain and climate condition, available infrastructure and transport system, technological and social restrictions, and finally available financial resources is a key decision in every wood-producing forest enterprise. The harvesting system contributes in a high proportion to the profitability of the wood production and therefore the costs of the raw material provided to the wood industry. For selecting the most adequate harvesting system, not only the investment costs for machines, training of personnel or staff, as well as maintenance costs should be considered. The important question for harvesting is how much does the cubic meter of wood loaded on the truck in the forest cost. In a broader sense, the total costs of the raw material put in the log yard of the respective wood industry crucial to take the decision of the best harvesting and transport system. The performance and productivity of the system as well as long-term factors like environmental degradation of forest production sites determine if the harvesting operations are conducted with an appropriate system or not. The number of wood-harvesting machines and technologies available at a global level is extremely high, multiplying by the options of putting the single processing steps lead to numberless combinations. The article pretends to classify harvesting systems from different points of view and to present some of the most frequently applied harvesting systems in the tropics on a global level. Since the innovation in harvesting technologies and equipment is very high, new systems and combination of single processing steps are found in harvesting practice every year. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.","Chipping; Cut-to-length; Full-tree; Harvesting systems; Logging; Tree-length; Wood harvesting","Malinovski, J.R.; Malinovski FlorestalBrazil; email: jorge@malinovski.com.br",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017627626

As a consequence, tropical foresters began developing logging procedures that were more environmentally benign, and by the 1990s, these practices began to be described as “reduced-impact logging” (RIL) systems. As scientific evidence accumulated demonstrating that RIL techniques could substantially reduce logging impacts on the residual forest relative to conventional logging (CL), attention turned to understanding the financial conditions under which logging firms would choose to implement RIL. While most studies conducted in Latin America show that RIL is financially competitive or superior to CL, research in Southeast Asia and Africa suggests that economic incentives will likely be required to induce logging firms to adopt RIL. One approach that appears promising to promote better logging practices in the tropics is to offer payments for the incremental carbon retained by RIL systems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.","Bioeconomic models; Carbon payments; Forest damage; Forest resilience; Sustainable tropical forest management","Holmes, T.; USDA Forest Service, United States; email: tholmes@fs.fed.us",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017600664

Quantifying the biomass and carbon stocks contained in tropical forests has become an international priority for the implementation of the REDD+ mechanism. Forest biomass is estimated at three successive levels: the tree, the stand and the region level. This paper reviews the state of the art regarding the estimation of biomass and carbon stocks in tropical African forests. Literature. This review highlights the fact that very few allometric equations, equations used for estimating the biomass of the tree using non-destructive measurements (diameter, height), have been established for tropical African forests. At the stand level, the review highlights the spatial and temporal variations in biomass between forest types in Central and Eastern Africa. While biomass recovery after a disturbance (logging, for instance) is rather quick, a great deal of uncertainty still remains regarding the spatial variation in biomass, and there is no consensus on a regional biomass map. The quality of biomass mapping in tropical Africa strongly depends on the type of remotely-sensed data being used (optical, RADAR or LIDAR), and the allometric equation used to convert forest inventory data into biomass. Conclusions. Based on the lack of precision of the available allometric equations and forest inventory data and the large spatial scale involved, many uncertainties persist in relation to the estimation of the biomass and carbon stocks contained in African tropical forests. © 2016, FAC UNIV SCIENCES AGRONOMIQUES GEMBLOUX.

Samples of soil and leaf litter were selected on the territory of the forest Ma Da in the reserve Dong Nai (Dong Nai province, South Vietnam) in primary dipterocarp forest (the main tree species are Dipterocarpus dyeri, Irvingia malayana), which is not affected by logging. Soil is red-yellow ferrallitic on shales. Two adjacent areas with different microrelief were selected-flat part with the small increase, where the layer of litter is large, and the other one with small decrease. Identification of fungi was performed with analysis of morphological features and with molecular-genetic methods. As a result of research, 123 species of 45 genera of microscopic fungi were found. Basidiomycota was represented by only one species. Zygomycota was represented by 5 species of 5 genera. Most of identified fungi belong to Ascomycota-117 species, accounting for 95 % of the identified species, and most of them are anamorphic. The leading order is Eurotiales, including 67 species of 6 genera (55 % of species richness). The next order of species richness is Hypocreales, which was represented by 23 species (19 %). Order Xylariales has 5 species from 4 genera (4 %). There were the following species-Aspergillus sydowii, A. phoenicis, Penicillium aculeatum, P. diversum, Pseudallescheria boydii, Trichoderma harzianum-that dominated in the soil of the flat part of the dipterocarp forest in 2011. There were sterile dark-colored fungi, Aspergillus aculeatus, A. phoenicis, Fusarium merismoides, Penicillium citrinum, Trichoderma harzianum that dominated in the litter. And finally there were the other species-Gongronella butleri, Penicillium brevicompactum, P. daleae, P. rubrum, Purpureocillium lilacinum-that dominated in the soil of part with small decrease. There were Penicillium brevicompactum, Pestalotiopsis sp., Purpureocillium lilacinum, Trichoderma harzianum and sterile fungi from order Xylariales in the litter of the same type of forest. Species composition of micromycetes isolated from soil and litter of the dipterocarp forests in the forest reserve Dong Nai has special features that previously were identified for the lowland tropical forest.","Biodiversity; Primary tropical lowland dipterocarp forests; Soil microscopic fungi; South Vietnam",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989243795

In situ parameters were measured, and water and sediment samples were collected at six stations before rain. Additionally, water quality was investigated at three stations after rain. The results showed that canopy removal resulted in large temperature variation and sedimentation in the forest streams. Lower suspended solids were found at stations with inactive logging (<2 mg/L) compared to active logging (10-16 mg/L) activities. The highest concentration of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in water and sediment was 4.4 mg/L, 77.6 μg/L, 0.17%, and 0.01%, respectively. Besides, significantly negative correlation of sediment nitrogen and water total ammonia nitrogen indicated the loss of nitrogen from sediment to water.

In anticipation of the increase in the frequency of drought episodes predicted by climatic models for intertropical regions, it is essential to study commercial trees' resilience and vulnerability to water stress by identifying potential interaction effects between selective logging and stress due to a lack of water. Focusing on 14 species representing a potential or acknowledged commercial interest for wood production in the Guiana Shield, a joint model coupling growth and mortality for each species was parametrized, including a climatic variable related to water stress and the quantity of aboveground biomass lost after logging. For the vast majority of the species, water stress had a negative impact on growth rate, while the impact of logging was positive. The opposite results were observed for the mortality. Combining results from growth and mortality models, we generate vulnerability profiles and ranking from species apparently quite resistant to water stress (Chrysophyllum spp., Goupia glabra Aubl., Qualea rosea Aubl.), even under logging pressure, to highly vulnerable species (Sterculia spp.). In light of our results, forest managers in the Guiana Shield may want to conduct (i) a conservation strategy of the most vulnerable species and (ii) a diversification of the logged species. Conservation of the already-adapted species may also be considered as the most certain way to protect the tropical forests under future climates. © 2016 by the authors.","Climate change; Growth rates; Mortality rates; Paracou; Selective logging","Hérault, B.; Cirad, French Guiana; email: bruno.herault@cirad.fr",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971215891

Using 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we compared composition and functional attributes of soil biota between unlogged, once-logged and twice-logged rainforest, and areas converted to oil palm plantations in Sabah, Borneo. Although there was no significant effect of logging history, we found a significant difference between the taxonomic and functional composition of both primary and logged forests and oil palm. Oil palm had greater abundances of genes associated with DNA, RNA, protein metabolism and other core metabolic functions, but conversely, lower abundance of genes associated with secondary metabolism and cell–cell interactions, indicating less importance of antagonism or mutualism in the more oligotrophic oil palm environment. Overall, these results show a striking difference in taxonomic composition and functional gene diversity of soil microorganisms between oil palm and forest, but no significant difference between primary forest and forest areas with differing logging history. This reinforces the view that logged forest retains most features and functions of the original soil community.

Forest degradation caused by logging contributes to loss of animal species that require specialized habitats to survive, such as woodcreepers that inhabit understorey areas. Habitat associations of woodcreeper species can be important for identifying species that have restricted distribution and/or habitat specialization. Our study investigates the effects of spatial variation in forest structure and some landscape features (canopy openness, altitude, distance to stream and exploited basal area) on the abundance and composition of woodcreeper assemblage in selectively logged tropical forests in Southern Amazonia. We used mist-nets and points count to quantify the composition and abundance of woodcreepers in 32 plots in three sites. Plots were spatially arranged in PPBio LTER sites (long-term ecological research plots, systematically spaced at 1-km intervals) in Southern Amazonia. A total of 240 individuals (captured, observed and/or heard) belonging to 11 woodcreeper species were detected. Mantel tests showed that there is no spatial autocorrelation among woodcreeper assemblage and distance between plots. Altitude and canopy openness were significantly associated with the composition of the woodcreeper assemblage. Altitude was negatively associated with species richness, and the abundance of the two dominant species (Glyphorynchus spirurus and Xiphorhynchus elegans). The negative relationship with canopy openness suggests that woodcreeper assemblages that inhabit understorey are likely to be indirectly affected by selective logging which reduces canopy cover. The selective logging indirectly changes bird species assemblages, and depending on the intensity, may result in the local extinction of some insectivorous species. Short- and long-term studies addressing different intensities of selective logging are needed to determine the impacts on the bird species and forest structure.

The satellite remote sensing data can provide information more effective and economical input rather than direct field observation that is difficult to access. In this research, we applied a spectral index derived from remote sensing satellite data, the Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI), then compared it with the widely used forest degradation index, the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), in order to have an enhanced detection of forest canopy damage caused by selective logging activities and associated forest fires in West Kalimantan, especially in Kapuas Hulu and Sintang districts. The NDFI was derived from combination of green vegetation, shadow, soil, and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) fractions images from spectral mixture analysis model. The NBR and NDVI were generated from spectral reflectance values of near-infrared, shortwave infrared, and red spectrums. The satellite data used for monitoring forest degradation were Landsat-year 2006–2009 and then continued with 4-year SPOT 2009–2012. The result showed that the forest degradation was detected initially in 2008 up to 2012 in the research area. Spectral indices analysis (NDFI, NBR, NDVI) was tested and verified by ground survey data in 2012. We found that NDFI has higher accuracy (95 %) to classify the degradation forest due to logging and burning activities rather than NBR or NDVI.

Several REDD+ projects have recently shown that local communities can monitor above ground biomass as well as external professionals, but at lower costs. However, the precision and accuracy of carbon monitoring conducted by local communities have rarely been assessed in the tropics. The aim of this study was to investigate different sources of error in tree biomass measurements conducted by community monitors and determine the effect on biomass estimates. Furthermore, we explored the potential of local ecological knowledge to assess wood density and botanical identification of trees. Results: Community monitors were able to measure tree DBH accurately, but some large errors were found in girth measurements of large and odd-shaped trees. Monitors with experience from the logging industry performed better than monitors without previous experience. Indeed, only experienced monitors were able to discriminate trees with low wood densities. Local ecological knowledge did not allow consistent tree identification across monitors. Conclusion: Future REDD+ programmes may benefit from the systematic training of local monitors in tree DBH measurement, with special attention given to large and odd-shaped trees. A better understanding of traditional classification systems and concepts is required for local tree identifications and wood density estimates to become useful in monitoring of biomass and tree diversity.","Community monitoring; Indonesia; MRV; REDD+; Species identification; Tree biomass; Wood density","Rutishauser, E.; CarboForExpertSwitzerland; email: er.rutishauser@gmail.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937469549

Deforestation, logging, fragmentation, fire, and climate change have significant effects on tropical carbon stocks; however, an elusive and yet undetected decrease in carbon storage may be due to defaunation of large seed dispersers. Many large tropical trees with sizeable contributions to carbon stock rely on large vertebrates for seed dispersal and regeneration, however many of these frugivores are threatened by hunting, illegal trade, and habitat loss. We used a large data set on tree species composition and abundance, seed, fruit, and carbon-related traits, and plant-animal interactions to estimate the loss of carbon storage capacity of tropical forests in defaunated scenarios. By simulating the local extinction of trees that depend on large frugivores in 31 Atlantic Forest communities, we found that defaunation has the potential to significantly Erode carbon storage even when only a small proportion of large-seeded trees are extirpated. Although intergovernmental policies to reduce carbon emissions and reforestation programs have been mostly focused on deforestation, our results demonstrate that defaunation, and the loss of key ecological interactions, also poses a serious risk for the maintenance of tropical forest carbon storage. © The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.",,"Galetti, M.; Departamento de Ecologia, Brazil; email: mgaletti@rc.unesp.br",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956950406

The strategy most frequently used to protect this biodiversity is to make parks and reserves. While there is a great deal of research on the effectiveness of parks for protecting biodiversity, there is little research on how well extractive reserves conserve biodiversity. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of four forest reserves in western Uganda at maintaining populations of primates and compare census data from the reserves to data from the neighbouring well-protected Kibale National Park. The relative abundance of the five most common primates in the park was approximately four times that of the forest reserves. In the forest reserves, evidence of new human encroachment was seen every 500 m, while in the park it was seen every 100,000 m. Two recommendations emerge from our research: (i) for forest reserves, such as those studied here, to have conservation value for primates, extraction must be reduced and (ii) until the long-term viability of the populations in forest reserves can be ascertained, they should not be considered in estimates of the sizes of endangered species protected ranges. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Bushmeat; Extractive reserves; Forest reserves; Human encroachment; Kibale national park; Logging","Chapman, C.A.; Department of Zoology, P.O.

Yet, the effect that timber extraction has on animal behavior and habitat use is poorly known. We tested whether the density, distribution, and composition of sleeping sites used by spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) differed between two logged and two unlogged forest sites in the Calakmul region, southeastern Mexico. We recorded a total of 74 sleeping sites (0.11 sleeping sites/ha). The density of sleeping sites did not differ between forest conditions. Most (97%) sleeping sites were located in medium-stature semievergreen forest, and only 3% in low-stature seasonally inundated forest. In three of four sites, the number of sleeping sites in core areas was significantly greater than expected by chance, showing an aggregated spatial distribution, particularly in areas containing a greater density of feeding trees. About half (51%) of the sleeping sites were composed of a single large tree (mean ± SD diameter at breast height, 42.2 ± 21.9 cm) from a small number of tree species, such as Lonchocarpus castelloi, Bucida buceras, and Lysiloma latisiliquum. These results suggest that the current level of timber extraction seems to have no effect on the density, distribution, and composition of sleeping sites. Nevertheless, because the species that were selected as sleeping trees are subject to timber extraction, the availability of sleeping sites is expected to decrease in coming decades, potentially modifying the habitat use of this primate species. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Home range; Latrine; Neotropical primates; Seed dispersal; Sleeping tree; Timber extraction","Velázquez-Vázquez, G.; Departamento de Conservación de la Biodiversidad, Unidad Campeche, Mexico; email: ghavg@hotmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953636594

Tree response to logging damage is an important and overlooked ecological process potentially affecting 2-5% of all extant tropical trees. Here we report on the fates of damaged trees over the first 8-years after logging in a transitional Amazonian forest in Eastern Bolivia. Mortality rates of damaged trees peaked in the first year after logging, and then slowly declined to background rates by the end of the study, indicating that if a damaged tree survives 8. years, it then runs approximately the same annual mortality risk as an undamaged tree. Of all types of logging damage, crown damage reduced growth rates the most while inclined trees suffered the highest mortality rates. Neither wood density nor tree size conferred tolerance to damage, though species with bark exudates were less tolerant of damage. Surprisingly, damaged trees survived droughts better than undamaged trees, perhaps due to their proximity to felling gaps and concomitant reduced above- and below-ground competition or due to their reduced leaf areas and associated reductions in water stress. While this study only tests one interaction between an aspect of climate change and logging, we found a positive signal for forest resilience.

Short-term impacts of selective logging on tropical forests have been widely investigated, but long-term effects on temporal dynamics of forest structure and composition are largely unknown. Understanding these long-term dynamics will help determine whether tropical forests are resilient to selective logging and inform choices between competing demands of anthropogenic use versus conservation of tropical forests. Forest dynamics can be studied within the framework of succession theory, which predicts that temporal turnover rates should decline with time since disturbance. Here, we investigated the temporal dynamics of a tropical forest in Kibale National Park, Uganda over 45. years following selective logging. We estimated turnover rates in stems, species composition, and functional traits (wood density and diameter at breast height), using observations from four censuses in 1989, 1999, 2006, and 2013, of stems ≥10. cm diameter within 17 unlogged and 9 logged 200. ×. 10. m vegetation plots. We used null models to account for interdependencies among turnover rates in stems, species composition, and functional traits. We tested predictions that turnover rates should be higher and decrease with increasing time since the selective logging event in logged forest, but should be less temporally variable in unlogged forest. Overall, we found higher turnover rates in logged forest for all three attributes, but turnover rates did not decline through time in logged forest and was not less temporally variable in unlogged forest. These results indicate that successional models that assume recovery to pre-disturbance conditions are inadequate for predicting the effects of selective logging on the dynamics of the tropical forest in Kibale. Selective logging resulted in persistently higher turnover rates, which may compromise the carbon storage capacity of Kibale's forest. Selective logging effects may also interact with effects from other global trends, potentially causing major long-term shifts in the dynamics of tropical forests. Similar studies in tropical forests elsewhere will help determine the generality of these conclusions. Ultimately, the view that selective logging is a benign approach to the management of tropical forests should be reconsidered in the light of studies of the effects of this practice on long-term forest dynamics. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Beta-diversity; Disturbance; Functional traits; Kibale National Park; Null model; Succession","Osazuwa-Peters, O.L.; Department of Biology, University of Missouri Saint Louis, One University Boulevard, United States",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939443384

In tropical forests increasingly modified by human activities, the interplay between environmental factors and disturbance legacies on forest canopy structure across landscapes is practically unexplored. We used airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to measure the canopy of old-growth and selectively logged peat swamp forest across a peat dome in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, and quantified how canopy structure metrics varied with peat depth and under logging. Several million canopy gaps in different height cross-sections of the canopy were measured in 100 plots of 1 km2 spanning the peat dome, allowing us to describe canopy structure with seven metrics. Old-growth forest became shorter and had simpler vertical canopy profiles on deeper peat, consistent with previous work linking deep peat to stunted tree growth. Gap size frequency distributions (GSFDs) indicated fewer and smaller canopy gaps on the deeper peat (i.e. the scaling exponent of Pareto functions increased from 1.76 to 3.76 with peat depth). Areas subjected to concessionary logging until 2000, and illegal logging since then, had the same canopy top height as old-growth forest, indicating the persistence of some large trees, but mean canopy height was significantly reduced. With logging, the total area of canopy gaps increased and the GSFD scaling exponent was reduced. Logging effects were most evident on the deepest peat, where nutrient depletion and waterlogged conditions restrain tree growth and recovery. A tight relationship exists between canopy structure and peat depth gradient within the old-growth tropical peat swamp forest. This relationship breaks down after selective logging, with canopy structural recovery, as observed by ALS, modulated by environmental conditions. These findings improve our understanding of tropical peat swamp ecology and provide important insights for managers aiming to restore degraded forests. © Author(s) 2015.",,"Coomes, D.A.; Department of Plant Sciences, Downing Street, United Kingdom; email: dac18@cam.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948454481

Liana abundance and infestation were significantly lower in the LT forest than the UF, whereas these attributes were comparable in the TSS treated and the UF. Overall, the patterns of liana reproduction and climbing guilds were similar in the treated and untreated forests. Tree diameter was positively and significantly correlated to liana load, basal area, and degree of colonization in the treated and untreated forests. Mean liana load was the same on different tree bark types in the forest management regimes. These findings suggest that the impact of liana cutting on liana abundance was still apparent in the LT forest but not in the TSS treated forest.

Although many studies have taken an area-based approach to tropical rain forests, we adopted a tree-based approach to quantify the dependence of residual tree damage on the size of residual and felled trees. We used data from 179 plots, each 25. m. ×. 40. m, covering the stump and crown of one felled tree in Cambodian tropical semi-evergreen forests. We used the mixed-effects multinomial logistic regression model to predict the probability of a residual tree sustaining severe, slight or no damage. Increasing size of residual trees decreased the probability of severe damage and increased that of slight damage. The probability of total damage (severe plus slight) was nearly constant, regardless of the size of residual trees. Increasing size of the felled tree caused greater probability of severe damage, but did not influence the probability of slight damage. Interestingly, our prediction of total damage rate from the tree-based modeling approach of the Cambodian semi-evergreen forests is very consistent with the findings of previous studies using the area-based approach in Indonesia. The departure of our study results from those of other studies may be explained by differences in felled tree size and terrain slope.

This practice is an important source of timber, but there are concerns about its long-term sustainability and impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. However, logging impacts vary widely, making generalisation and, consequently, policy implementation, difficult. Recent syntheses of animal biodiversity have indicated that differences in logging intensity - the volume of wood removed ha-1 - might help to explain some of these disparities. In addition, it has widely been assumed that reduced impact logging (RIL) might minimise some of the negative effects of logging; though in practice, this has rarely been tested. To test the hypothesis that RIL reduces negative impacts of selective logging once intensity is controlled for, we used meta-analyses of selective logging impact studies, focusing specifically on (1) residual tree damage, (2) aboveground biomass and (3) tree species richness. Our results indicate that RIL appears to reduce residual tree damage when compared to conventional methods. However, changes in aboveground biomass were negatively related to logging intensity. Any effect of RIL, independent of logging intensity, was difficult to discern since it was carried out at relatively low intensities. Tree richness appeared to increase at low intensities but decreased at higher intensities and any effect of RIL was difficult to detect. Our results tentatively support the hypothesis that RIL reduces the negative impacts of logging on tree damage, but do not support suggestions that RIL reduces loss of aboveground biomass or tree species richness. However, this lack of support may be a result of the relative paucity of data on the topic. Based on our results, we suggest that better evidence is needed to assess the differences between the impacts of RIL and conventional logging. Studies that consider plot-level differences in logging intensity are required to fill this knowledge gap. In addition, there must be clarification of whether RIL is an inherently low intensity practice so that this can be factored into management. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Biomass; Deforestation; Degradation; Land-use; REDD+; RIL; Selective logging","Martin, P.A.; Centre for Conservation, United Kingdom; email: martinp@bournemouth.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945444581

To effectively manage and protect these areas, it is important to have an understanding of the factors affecting their biodiversity. Previous research has shown that birds in tropical regions are severely affected by human-induced habitat conversion and disturbance. The effects, however, are often area and guild-specific and the underlying mechanisms are frequently unclear. In this study, we disentangle and quantify the direct and indirect effects of human population density, distance to forest edge, habitat disturbance, and vegetation structure and composition on the total abundance and species richness of birds in Kakamega Forest, Kenya. Specifically, we use structural equation modeling to develop and test path models, which reflect the potential causal relationships between the bird assemblages and the chosen explanatory factors. Relationships were tested on the overall bird community and on five different guilds, classified according to birds’ forest specialization and feeding preferences (i.e. forest specialists, generalists and visitors, and frugivores and insectivores). Results showed that habitat disturbance, caused by logging, had a weak positive direct effect on the bird communities, but also had a strong detrimental indirect effect, particularly on the total abundance and species richness of forests specialists and insectivores. The negative effect was mediated through changes in the forest’s vegetation structure and composition. Shorter distances to the forest edge also had a negative effect, on all bird categories except on forest visitors, which also benefited from higher levels of disturbance. Our study shows that although in some cases habitat disturbance may have no strong direct negative effects it can still negatively influence bird communities in an indirect way. In the case of Kakamega Forest, we suggest that to conserve bird communities it is important to maintain the forest’s compositional and structural diversity by reducing human-induced habitat disturbance, such as illegal logging activities. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Anthropogenic habitat disturbance; Bird conservation; Species richness; Structural equation modeling; Tropical forests; Vegetation structure and composition","Mammides, C.; Division of Biology and Centre for Population Biology, United Kingdom; email: cmammides@xtbg.ac.cn",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945448553

We investigated how silvicultural intervention intensity affects tree species composition and diversity over 30years in the Brazilian Amazon by comparing them to pre-logging conditions and to an unlogged control. The interventions comprised logging in 1982 and thinning in 1993-1994 and ranged in intensity from 19 to 53% reduction in the original basal area (BA). Trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥5cm were measured on eight occasions in 41 permanent sample plots of 0.25ha each. Silvicultural intervention intensity influenced both tree species composition and its trajectory within 30years. In contrast, tree species diversity was not impaired. High intervention intensities (with BA reduction&gt;6.6m2ha-1) had a substantial influence on the community of trees (DBH≥10cm), which did not show signs of return to pre-logging species composition. The reduction of BA through harvesting damage and thinning had a stronger effect on species composition than logging of mature trees itself. Thus, damage should be kept to a minimal level and strong thinning interventions should be avoided. This may enhance ecosystem recovery and maintenance of biodiversity at other trophic levels. Since current permitted harvesting intensities in the Brazilian Amazon are lower than the lowest intensity examined in our study, legal harvesting practices are unlikely to cause substantial, long-term changes in tree species composition. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Brazilian Amazon; Forest recovery; Selective logging; Species diversity; Stand thinning; Time-constrained clustering","de Avila, A.L.; Faculty of Environment and Natural Resources, Tennenbacher Str. 4, Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939629670

We assessed reassembly of tree communities in different size classes along a successional gradient consisting of nine differently aged successional forests, namely, four regenerating former clear-cuts (9–19 years), three selectively logged (42–43 years) and two primary forests (PFs) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. The results show that the forests are converging and undergoing reassembly towards PFs. The species composition of seedlings, saplings and poles declined in similarity to the PF with age but that of mature trees in the different successional stages increased towards the PFs. These differences in tree species composition among the different size classes might be due to dominance of some particular species. Recovery of tree species density, diversity and dominance in all the size classes showed directional patterns as predicted by the deterministic model of succession. Compared to other variables, tree species density and diversity in selectively logged forests recovered relatively faster and was equivalent to or higher than that of PFs at 43 years. The results of the present study indicate that community reassembly in smaller sized trees followed a stochastic model of succession. However, as trees matured, they conform to the deterministic model of succession. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Community structure; disturbance; recovery; succession; tropical forest; Uganda","Owiny, A.A.; Department of Biology, Finland; email: arthur@uef.fi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964049207

The vast areas of logged tropical forest are often vulnerable to relogging, clear-felling, burning or conversion to plantations, despite evidence that logged forests retain a large proportion of tropical forest species at high abundances compared with alternate land uses. However, the demographic processes (e.g. survival, fecundity) that drive community or species properties (e.g. occurrence, density) in response to logging have never been examined. We used a novel capture-recapture-based sampling design to separate in situ reproduction from immigration-fuelled recruitment to investigate the demographic vital rates of six forest-dependent understorey insectivorous bird species along a logging continuum in the Eastern Himalaya Global Biodiversity Hotspot. We expected a positive relationship between forest intactness and reproductive rates, and that intact patches would contribute 'excess' individuals to logged patches from natal dispersal. Contrary to our expectations, we found: (i) a positive relationship between logging intensity and reproduction, and (ii) evidence of natal dispersal from more logged to less logged and intact forest patches. Our results indicate that for certain forest-dependent species in particular contexts, selectively logged habitats can have surprising and hitherto unrecognized demographic value that might be superior even to primary forest. Synthesis and applications. In most tropical settings, logged forests can not only support a greater subset of forest biodiversity than other forms of land use (for instance, agriculture), but can also play an important role in supporting populations of certain forest-dependent species. The ongoing conversion of large swathes of logged forest to non-forest habitat (such as oil palm plantation) because of their perceived lack of importance for biodiversity is a cause for serious concern for the conservation of tropical biodiversity.

Many are experiencing biodiversity declines because of pressures such as logging, fire and hunting in their immediate surroundings, and inadequate protection inside the reserves. Here we assess how the national socio-economic context in which protected areas are embedded correlates with temporal trends in the condition of their biodiversity. Focussing on 60 protected areas arrayed across the world's major tropical regions, we examine the correlation between the biodiversity 'health' of protected areas and indices of human population size, wealth, governance quality, the environmental ranking of their respective nation, and national emphasis on reserve protection. We hypothesize that, after controlling for variability in socio-economic context, a country's emphasis on implementing high-protection reserves reduces the likelihood of biodiversity decline in its protected areas. We find that, after accounting for spatial non-independence and general socio-economic context, the best predictor of biodiversity trends within a tropical protected area is the country's overall emphasis on reserve quality, as measured by the proportion of IUCN Category I-IV reserves in nations' protected-area networks.

In order to detect the logging operations, SPOT-5 satellite imagery was used to detect the deforested area and to extract parameters to calculate volume of biomass and amount of carbon stock loss. The image classification technique and on-screen digitizing was conducted to delineate the logging areas. There are four (4) maps produced from the analysis, which are the classified maps of the Besul Tambahan Permanent Forest Reserve before and after the logging operations, and digitized maps of the Besul Tambahan Permanent Reserve Forest (PRF) before and after logging operation. The results show the biomass volume and carbon stock losses of the study area due to the logging operations. From the classified images of SPOT-5 2012 and 2014, the estimated area due the logging operations is 113.49 ha. As for the biomass and carbon stock losses, 28.95% and 27.91% before the forest was logged respectively. Based on the digitized map, the logging operations have extracted 56.26 ha of the forest area before logged. Meanwhile, for the biomass and carbon stock loss, the logging operations took out about 14.09% and 14.01% of the forest volume before logged respectively.

Although biomass burning has been widely investigated at a global level in recent decades via satellite observations, less work has been conducted to examine the century-scale changes in global fire regimes and fire influences on the terrestrial carbon balance. In this study, we investigated global pyrogenic carbon emissions and fire influences on the terrestrial carbon fluxes from 1901 to 2010 by using a process-based land ecosystem model. Our results show a significant declining trend in global pyrogenic carbon emissions between the early 20th century and the mid-1980s but a significant upward trend between the mid-1980s and the 2000s as a result of more frequent fires in ecosystems with high carbon storage, such as peatlands and tropical forests. Over the past 110 years, average pyrogenic carbon emissions were estimated to be 2.43 Pg C yr-1 (1 Pg = 1015 g), and global average combustion rate (defined as carbon emissions per unit area burned) was 537.85 g C m-2 burned area. Due to the impacts of fires, the net primary productivity and carbon sink of global terrestrial ecosystems were reduced by 4.14 Pg C yr-1 and 0.57 Pg C yr-1, respectively. Our study suggests that special attention should be paid to fire activities in the peatlands and tropical forests in the future. Practical management strategies, such as minimizing forest logging and reducing the rate of cropland expansion in the humid regions, are in need to reduce fire risk and mitigate fire-induced greenhouse gases emissions. © 2015.

However, for much of Africa, accurate, ground-based measurements are few, forests have centuries of human use, and the variables that influence forest biomass and carbon stocks are not well understood. The objectives of this study were to use field-based sampling to estimate aboveground biomass (and associated carbon stocks), and explore AGB variation in relation to forest stand characteristics and human biomass removal in an African tropical forest that lies in a transitional ecological zone between lowland equatorial and moist montane forest. We quantified tree densities, estimated plot aboveground biomass (AGB) using pan-tropical allometric equations, and estimated human biomass removal in four regions of Kakamega Forest in western Kenya that varied in historical and current human use. Our carbon stock estimate (173.3MgCha-1) was above large biome averages for moist tropical forests. Diameter of the largest tree, stem densities of large trees, and wood density were the most important variables influencing biomass, accounting for over 75% of the variation. While historical disturbance influenced biomass removal, we did not find that this disturbance or biomass removal significantly influenced AGB. The reason was that most biomass removal involves trees in small size classes, which are insignificant contributors to biomass. Our findings provide a field based estimate of carbon stocks for a transitional tropical forest. We also conclude that processes (both natural and anthropogenic) which influence the presence and health of species which can attain large size will have the greatest impact on biomass, while processes that influence stem densities of small trees will have no measurable effect. The application of these findings for forestry-based carbon projects would translate to the need for special attention being paid to activities which prevent or minimize loss of large dense trees (e.g. charcoal production, selective logging) if the carbon stock of a forest is to be maintained. On the other hand, activities which limit subsistence use in terms cutting small stems (e.g. energy efficient stoves), might not have measureable immediate effects on carbon stocks and the financial outcomes associated with the generation and sale of the carbon credits. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Above ground biomass; Carbon stocks; Forest carbon project; Human use of forests; Kenya; Transitional tropical forest","Lung, M.; Eco2librium Corporation, 106.

These mega-structures, however, directly and indirectly interfere with natural ecosystem dynamics, and can cause noticeable tree loss. To improve our understanding of how hydroelectric dams affect the surrounding spatiotemporal patterns of forest disturbances, this case study integrated remote sensing spectral mixture analysis, GIS proximity analysis and statistical hypothesis testing to extract and evaluate spatially-explicit patterns of deforestation (clearing of entire forest patch) and forest degradation (reduced tree density) in the 80,000km2 neighborhoods of the Brazil's Tucuruí Dam, the first large-scale hydroelectric project in the Amazon region, over a period of 25 years from 1988 to 2013. Results show that the average rates of deforestation were consistent during the first three time periods 1988-1995 (620km2 per year), 1995-2001 (591km2 per year), and 2001-2008 (660km2 per year). However, such rate dramatically fell to half of historical levels after 2008, possibly reflecting the 2008 global economic crisis and enforcement of the Brazilian Law of Environmental Crimes. The rate of forest degradation was relatively stable from 1988 to 2013 and, on average, was 17.8% of the rate of deforestation. Deforestation and forest degradation were found to follow similar spatial patterns across the dam neighborhoods, upstream reaches or downstream reaches at the distances of 5km-80km, suggesting that small and large-scale forest disturbances may have been influencing each other in the vicinity of the dam. We further found that the neighborhoods of the Tucuruí Dam and the upstream region experienced similar degrees of canopy loss. Such loss was mainly attributed to the fast expansion of the Tucuruí town, and the intensive logging activities alongside major roads in the upstream reservoir region. In contrast, a significantly lower level of forest disturbance was discovered in the downstream region. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Amazon basin; Deforestation; Forest degradation; GIS; Hydroelectric dam; Remote sensing; Spatiotemporal pattern; Statistical analysis","Chen, G.; Department of Geography and Earth Sciences, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, 9201 University City Blvd, United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931262999

Such international regimes may aim to conserve natural forests or to support the exploitation of lands for a particular purpose, e.g. agricultural commodities. This paper's goal is to map the international regime complex for rainforest transformation by identifying those global and regional regimes that are relevant for tropical rainforest transformation systems in Indonesia. The relevance of international regimes for rainforest transformation is assessed based on a novel methodology using two criteria: First, international regimes may be relevant in Indonesia because the core problem they address exists in Indonesia (problem dimension). Second, specific international regimes may be made relevant by the actions of specific actors and their coalitions in pursuit of their interests (actor dimension). To achieve the study's goals we used (1) content analysis of international policy documents and treaty texts, (2) expert interviews with key informants in Indonesia, and (3) own field observations in current Indonesian land use politics. The results indicate that regimes dealing with biological diversity, climate change, trade in endangered species, wetland management, international tropical trade, illegal logging, Southeast Asian (ASEAN) forest and environment, the Asia Pacific free trade, and the southeast Asian rubber trade regime are relevant in both the problem and actor dimensions. The regimes concerned with desertification and international forestry research are relevant only in the actor dimension. In contrast, the following regimes are relevant only in the problem dimension: indigenous rights, forest certification, palm oil certification, agroforestry certification, and international rubber trade. We discuss our results considering global and regional regimes relevant to Indonesian rainforest transformation systems. We conclude that regimes relevant solely due to the engagement of domestic actors and not in respect of the problem dimension are unlikely to maintain their relevance in the long term. In the short term, however, they have the potential for creating substantial political benefits for the actors using them. In contrast, regimes with high problem relevance but low actor backing are unlikely to even enter the political agenda, and therefore will have only limited impact. This suggests that future research should consider that, whilst relevance in the problem dimension is necessary to establish regime influence, it alone does not suffice. We can expect global and regional regimes to have an influence only when powerful actors back them in their agenda setting, domestic policy formulation and actual implementation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Actor-dimension; Agroforestry; International agreements; International forest regimes; International land use policies; Native forests; Palm oil plantations; Problem-dimension; Relevance of international regimes; Rubber plantations","Sahide, M.A.K.Busgenweg 3, Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930943923

Matrix population modeling is one way to simulate long-term impacts of tree harvests, but this approach has often ignored common impacts of tree harvests including incidental damage, changes in post-harvest demography, shifts in the distribution of merchantable trees, and shifts in stand composition.We designed a matrix-based forest management model that incorporates these harvest-related impacts so resulting simulations reflect forest stand dynamics under repeated timber harvests as well as the realities of local smallholder timber management systems. Using a wide range of values for management criteria (e.g., length of cutting cycle, minimum cut diameter), we projected the longterm population dynamics and yields of hundreds of timber management regimes in the Amazon estuary, where small-scale, unmechanized logging is an important economic activity. These results were then compared to find optimal stand-level and species-specific sustainable timber management (STM) regimes using a set of timber yield and population growth indicators. Prospects for STM in Amazonian tidal floodplain forests are better than for many other tropical forests. However, generally high stock recovery rates between harvests are due to the comparatively high projected mean annualized yields from fastgrowing species that effectively counterbalance the projected yield declines from other species. For Amazonian tidal floodplain forests, national management guidelines provide neither the highest yields nor the highest sustained population growth for species under management. Our research shows that management guidelines specific to a region's ecological settings can be further refined to consider differences in species demographic responses to repeated harvests. In principle, such fine-tuned management guidelines could make management more attractive, thus bridging the currently prevalent gap between tropical timber management practice and regulation.This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Fourteen of the 30 CFEs harvested more timber than they grew in 2011, suggesting issues with sustainability, but only two of these had harvest far above annual growth, and five of those were only a fraction more than annual growth.

Deforestation and forest degradation are the immediate threats to this guild, with agricultural expansion (particularly oil palm plantations), urbanization, road expansion and logging leading the list. Although vulnerabilities of this guild are most evident in the Neotropics, there are few studies from Asia and fewer still from Africa-we recommend increased geographic coverage. If we are to understand the vulnerabilities of understory insectivores from a pantropical perspective, researchers should prioritize understanding the most serious threats (e.g., edge effects, deforestation, fragmentation, etc.) and standardize efforts to gauge understory insectivores' response to these threats (e.g., via species richness, abundance, demographic metrics). A coordinated approach by researchers working in tropical rainforests across the globe can help us understand the ecology of understory insectivores and meaningfully apply conservation and management actions. © 2015 .","Deforestation; Fragmentation; Mixed species flocks; Pantropical; Rainforests; Understory insectivores","Powell, L.L.; Migratory Bird Center, United States; email: Luke.L.Powell@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028213670

The Eco-gene simulation model was used to evaluate the long-term impacts of selective logging over 300 years on two contrasting Brazilian Amazon tree species, Dipteryx odorata and Jacaranda copaia. D. odorata (Leguminosae), a slow growing climax tree, occurs at very low densities, whereas J. copaia (Bignoniaceae) is a fast growing pioneer tree that occurs at high densities. Microsatellite multilocus genotypes of the pre-logging populations were used as data inputs for the Eco-gene model and post-logging genetic data was used to verify the output from the simulations. Overall, under current Brazilian forest management regulations, there were neither short nor long-term impacts on J. copaia. By contrast, D. odorata cannot be sustainably logged under current regulations, a sustainable scenario was achieved by increasing the minimum cutting diameter at breast height from 50 to 100 cm over 30-year logging cycles. Genetic parameters were only slightly affected by selective logging, with reductions in the numbers of alleles and single genotypes. In the short term, the loss of alleles seen in J. copaia simulations was the same as in real data, whereas fewer alleles were lost in D. odorata simulations than in the field. The different impacts and periods of recovery for each species support the idea that ecological and genetic information are essential at species, ecological guild or reproductive group levels to help derive sustainable management scenarios for tropical forests.",,,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027956133

Depending on the approaches and methods employed, estimating biomass by using these technologies sometimes can lead to uncertainties. The study was conducted to investigate appropriate methods for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) by using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. A total of 60187 ha in Dungun Timber Complex (DTC) were selected as the study area. Thirty seven sample plots, measuring 30×30 m were established in early 2012 covering both natural and logged forests. Phase Array Type L-Band SAR (Palsar) images that were acquired in 2010 were used as primary remote sensing input and shapefile polygons comprised logging records was used as supporting information. By using these data, two estimation methods, which were 'stratify and multiply' (SM) and 'direct remote sensing' (DR) have been adopted and the results were compared. The estimated total AGB were about 20.1 and 22.3 million Mg, from SM and DR methods, respectively. The study found that the images that incorporated texture measures produced more accurate estimates as compared to the images without texture measures. The study suggests that SM method still a viable and reliable technique for quick assessment of AGB in a large area.

Ghanaian forests belong to West Africa's highly fragmented Upper Guinea rain forests, part of a global priority ""biodiversity hotspot"" under intense pressure from anthropogenic degradation. Between 1995 and 2010, officially-reported legal logging intensities increased up to ~600%, while illegal logging, which now accounts for 80% of timber extraction in Ghana, has driven logging intensities to ~6 times greater than the maximum sustainable rate. We collected data in 2008-2010 and used a comparable dataset collected in 1993-1995 to assess impacts of recent logging on understory bird communities in large forest fragments (100-524km2) in southwest Ghana. Forest understory bird species abundance declined by >50% during this period. Species richness also showed declining trends. Whereas analysis based on data collected in 1993-1995 estimated a partial post-logging recovery of the understory bird community at that time, data from 2008-2010 showed no indication of post-logging recovery, likely due to ongoing illegal logging following intensive legal logging operations. Forest generalist species and sallying insectivores declined significantly in logged compared to unlogged forests. These severe declines of Upper Guinea forest understory birds indicate the rapidly deteriorating conservation status of a biodiversity hotspot and could signal collapsing ecosystem processes. Immediate conservation actions are urgently required to protect surviving forest fragments from further degradation and avian declines. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Abundance; Forest generalists; Illegal logging; Sallying insectivores; Species richness; Tropical forest; Understory bird community","Arcilla, N.; Department of Biodiversity, Earth and Environmental Science, Drexel UniversityUnited States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937956316

Dietary traits are critical in this respect, and are typically examined by assigning species to different feeding and foraging guilds. However, such guilds may mask large variation in species' trophic interactions, limiting our understanding of species' responses. Here we use stable isotopes to quantify trophic positions within a Family of insectivorous understory birds, the Timaliidae (babblers), within Bornean rainforests. We then relate changes in species' abundances following intensive selective logging of forest to their trophic positions, body sizes and foraging heights. We found that trophic positions within this single feeding guild spanned more than an entire trophic level. Moreover, changes in abundance following logging were significantly and independently related to mean trophic position in primary forest, body size and foraging height: large ground-feeding species occupying high trophic positions were more adversely affected than small understory-feeders with lower trophic positions. These three variables together explained 81% of the variance in species' responses to logging. The single most important predictor, however, was a species' mean trophic position. Species recorded in both habitats also had significantly higher trophic positions in logged forest. These data provide critical new understanding of species' responses to disturbance. They also indicate previously unrecognised functional changes to species assemblages following logging, highlighting the importance of numerical assessments of trophic position within individual feeding guilds. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Biodiversity; Extinction; Food-web; Foraging guild; Southeast Asia; Tropical rainforest","Hamer, K.C.; School of Biology, University of LeedsUnited Kingdom",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937955793

Logging greatly alters abiotic and biotic factors which are fundamental in seedling establishment and spatial heterogeneity of tree recruitment. Niche and dispersal processes may affect post-logging seedling establishment, particularly in water-constrained tropical dry forests (TDF). To understand how selective logging affects tree recruitment and how forest exploitation can become a sustainable practice, a theoretical framework has been set up based on these processes. We assessed post-logging seedling establishment in a Bolivian Chiquitano TDF by: (i) characterizing logging microsites and the variability in abiotic (canopy openness, soil compaction and soil water content) and biotic (short and long-distance dispersal) factors among them, (ii) evaluating the roles played by those factors, here considered surrogates of niche and dispersal processes, on seedling establishment, and (iii) providing guidelines to ensure tree regeneration in similar logged TDFs. One year after logging, seedling establishment of five canopy tree species was assessed in four microsite types created by selective logging and in undisturbed TDF. Dispersal processes were described by interpolated kernel estimates of abundance of adult trees, i.e. potential seed sources. After logging, the abiotic environment was considerably altered, especially in the most disturbed logging microsites, leading to significant changes in canopy openness and soil compaction, the most important factors determining seedling establishment in four out of the five studied species. Dispersal processes also influenced regeneration in three tree species. Since the spatial distribution of adult trees influences post-logging regeneration, this should be considered to improve sustainability in logging operations across the tropics. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Canopy openness; Environmental heterogeneity; Soil compaction; Tropical dry forest; Zero-inflated poisson models","Corrià-Ainslie, R.; Instituto Pirenaico de Ecología (IPE-CSIC), Avda.

Two specific barriers limit the effectiveness of this approach in the timber concessions of Central Africa. On one hand, formal attempts at MFM are poorly conceived either because they promote forest uses, such as ecological functions or tourism, that have little relevance to direct stakeholders, or because they rely on the legal definition of local users' rights, which is disconnected to customary rules and practices. The article develops an alternative approach for six timber concessions in Cameroon, Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo, in which the foremost purpose of MFM is to solve or reduce actual conflicts of uses, notably regarding agriculture, hunting, chainsaw milling and firewood collection. On the other hand, the costs of implementing MFM measures are rarely estimated and assigned to concerned actors. The costs of resolving conflicts of use were evaluated in the same concessions, based on consensual solutions elaborated by the logging companies, the forestry and agriculture administrations and the local people. In half of these concessions, the cost of MFM equals or exceeds 1.5 million dollars in the next fifteen years. Several trade-offs are possible between these stakeholders, combining tax relief, technical and financial support to local development, and reduction of some illegal practices. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cameroon; Conflict; Congo; Gabon; Logging; Social forestry","Lescuyer, G.; CIFOR, Indonesia; email: g.lescuyer@cgiar.org",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929963110

In particular, clumps of related saplings with impoverished diversity are found in canopy gaps but not under forest cover. Context: Forest disturbances can have long-term consequences on the genetic structure of tree populations, because they can alter the demographic properties of the regeneration process and favour some subpopulations/genotypes, both by stochastic processes and by selection. Intermediate disturbances tend to favour species diversity, at least in highly diverse communities, but their effect on intra-specific diversity is unknown. Aims: In this study, we have looked at the genetic consequences of forest disturbance in a stand of the long-lived Neotropical pioneer species, Jacaranda copaia. Methods: The study site was experimentally logged in 1984, and the canopy gaps generated by the logging were mapped. Seedlings of J. copaia colonised the gaps, as expected, at a higher density than in the surrounding forest. In 2006, we exhaustively sampled all saplings and adult trees available in a 25-ha area. The samples were genotyped at nine microsatellite loci, and the distribution of genetic diversity was inspected by analyses of spatial autocorrelation, automated Bayesian assignment and comparisons of diversity between cohorts by bootstrap (RaBoT). Results: Spatial autocorrelation was found to extend farther in post-disturbance saplings than in the undisturbed population (100 m and beyond versus less than 50 m), and divergent clumps (FST = 0.05) of related genotypes were found; genetic diversity was found to be impoverished in each clump relative to the global population at about half of the loci. Conclusion: Overall, our results suggest that forest disturbance has changed the patterns of distribution of genetic diversity, with potential consequences on long-term population viability. © 2015, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.","Amazon; Bayesian clustering; Demogenetics; Guiana shield; Parentage analysis; Regeneration; Spatial genetic structure; Tropical rainforest","Scotti, I.; INRA, URFM « Ecologie des Forêts Méditerranéennes », Domaine de Saint-Paul, France",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934970783

In addition to traditional wood products, the forests provide grazing lands, nonwood forest products, fuelwood, and ecosystem services. Unfortunately, growing populations and the structure of the community forest enterprises are placing increasing stress on forest resources. Furthermore, illegal harvesting, selective logging, routine burning for forage production, and unsuccessful reforestation efforts have depleted forest resources in many regions. Few local communities possess adequate forest nurseries to properly reforest degraded areas. The recent recommitment to nursery production and reforestation by Comisio´n Nacional Forestal (CONAFOR) should lead to improved stand establishment and growth, especially as forest communities understand the critical link between reforestation and sustained forest productivity. CONAFOR, a federal agency responsible for reforestation programs, has restructured nursery production, reduced the total number of nurseries, and contracted with newly established, private nurseries that now produce 38 million seedlings/year (about 20% of all seedlings produced). The number of community nurseries has shrunk with this greater reliance on private and military (SEDENA) nurseries, which tend to be larger and more sophisticated and use containerized seedlings rather than polybag systems.

However, developing countries are required to report on their carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in order to obtain compensation (financed by developed countries) within the REDD+ framework. Radar remote sensing is useful for national monitoring, reporting, and verification of forest degradation features in line with REDD+. Radar sensors can overcome the problems of clouds and haze that often limit continuous and periodic monitoring by optical sensors. This chapter presents the outcome of research that was conducted in Youbi, Congo-Brazzaville, assessing the potential of very high (1 m - 3 m) and medium (8 m - 30 m) resolution synthetic aperture radar imagery (SAR) for identifying forest degradation signs using visual interpretation and semi-automated methods. Logging roads were only visible on 1 m TerraSAR-X SpotLight and 3 m TerraSAR-X StripMap imagery. Both of these data sources and RADARSAT Multi-Look Fine images could detect clearcuts in dense to open canopy forest types. To assess whether the detection of such logging roads and clearcuts can be automated, an experimental automated approach was developed. The approach of thresholding and subsequent majority filtering proved an effective automation for separating most clearcuts in coarse canopied forest, especially within degraded forests. This research concludes that the detection of logging roads by SAR requires spatial resolutions below 5 m, while clearcuts are detectable with 10 m resolution, and further research to determine the applicability and limitations to a greater extent is recommended. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, despite the proliferation of forest certification over the past two decades, few studies have evaluated its effectiveness. Using temporally and spatially explicit village-level data on environmental and socio-economic indicators in Kalimantan (Indonesia), we evaluate the performance of the FSC-certified timber concessions compared to non-certified logging concessions. Employing triple difference matching estimators, we find that between 2000 and 2008 FSC reduced aggregate deforestation by 5 percentage points and the incidence of air pollution by 31%. It had no statistically significant impacts on fire incidence or core areas, but increased forest perforation by 4 km2 on average. In addition, we find that FSC reduced firewood dependence (by 33%), respiratory infections (by 32%) and malnutrition (by 1 person) on average. By conducting a rigorous statistical evaluation of FSC certification in a biodiversity hotspot such as Indonesia, we provide a reference point and offer methodological and data lessons that could aid the design of ongoing and future evaluations of a potentially critical conservation policy. © 2015 Miteva et al.

Such behaviors, often demonstrating habitat use, can play a crucial role in understanding wildlife monitoring and conservation. Crocodilian nesting is one such activity. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are auto-piloted aircraft that can be used to map areas aerially using high resolution photography. Previously detectable through expensive helicopter surveys, this study sought to provide a new and less expensive method for the detection of estuarine crocodile nests in tropical forest ecosystems, as well as to propose additional applications of the technology based on field performance levels. The use of drones to detect crocodile nests is the first such application of the technology. We successfully identified two crocodile nests during the course of five flight hours (1550 ha; 15.5 km2) of testing along the Kinabatangan River in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, confirming the feasibility of the technology. We located these nests in close proximity to oil palm plantations, suggesting that low-level disturbance does not provide an obstacle to successful nesting. The potential to identify nests within unprotected forest could lead to additional protected areas being listed, and the effective management of crocodile nesting habitat will also provide benefits for many additional species within the ecosystem. Other applications of the technology within lowland tropical forest could include detection of logging, enhancing anti-poaching patrols, and real-time landscape mapping. © 2015. Luke J. Evans.

In understanding the spatial and temporal variation of soil CO2 efflux after several years of forest logging, there is a need to quantify the changing soil properties, environmental factors, and the total above and below ground biomass. This study was conducted in a 50-year old recovering tropical lowland forest in Peninsular Malaysia, measuring soil CO2 efflux using the continuous open flow chambers technique connected to a multi gas-handling unit and infrared gas analyser. The aim of this study was to determine the spatial and temporal variation of soil CO2 efflux in relation to changes in soil properties, environmental factors and forest carbon in a recovering forest. The efflux rates of about 389.20, 634.78, 564.81, 537.92 and 428.72 mg m−2 h−1, respectively, varied across the days and months, increasing from February and attaining the maximum in March and then gradually decreasing from April to June. The soil properties revealed a considerable amount of soil organic carbon, total organic carbon, and soil organic carbon stock, while the total above ground biomass, below ground biomass, soil pH, nitrogen to carbon ratio were found to provide nutrients for microbial activities in soil and to emit soil CO2. The multiple linear regression model indicated that the soil temperature and moisture explained the spatial and temporal variation in soil CO2 efflux; likewise, the changes in the soil properties and forest carbon significantly increased the soil CO2 efflux indicating a strong positive correlation (R2 = 0.93). © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biomass; Forest ecosystem; Microbial; Soil CO2 efflux; Spatial and temporal variation","Abdullah, A.M.; Department of Environmental Sciences, Malaysia",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939938855

Logging and the expansion of oil palm agriculture are two of the most significant drivers of tropical deforestation, and the latter is most prevalent in Southeast Asia. The aim of this study was to compare soil fungal communities from three sites in Malaysia that represent three of the most dominant land-use types in the Southeast Asia tropics: a primary forest, a regenerating forest that had been selectively logged 50 years previously, and a 25-year-old oil palm plantation. Soil cores were collected from three replicate plots at each site, and fungal communities were sequenced using the Illumina platform. Extracellular enzyme assays were assessed as a proxy for soil microbial function. We found that fungal communities were distinct across all sites, although fungal composition in the regenerating forest was more similar to the primary forest than either forest community was to the oil palm site. Ectomycorrhizal fungi, which are important associates of the dominant Dipterocarpaceae tree family in this region, were compositionally distinct across forests, but were nearly absent from oil palm soils. Extracellular enzyme assays indicated that the soil ecosystem in oil palm plantations experienced altered nutrient cycling dynamics, but there were few differences between regenerating and primary forest soils. Together, these results show that logging and the replacement of primary forest with oil palm plantations alter fungal community and function, although forests regenerating from logging had more similarities with primary forests in terms of fungal composition and nutrient cycling potential. Since oil palm agriculture is currently the mostly rapidly expanding equatorial crop and logging is pervasive across tropical ecosystems, these findings may have broad applicability. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"McGuire, K.L.; Department of Biology, 3009 Broadway, United States; email: kmcguire@barnard.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928694075

There has been a gradual impoverishment of forest resources inside selectively logged forests in which the volume of timber extracted over the first cutting cycle was mostly from large, old trees that matured over a century or more and grew in the absence of strong anthropological pressures. In forests now being logged for a second and third time, that volume has not been reconstituted due in part to the lack of implementation of post-logging silvicultural treatments. This depletion of timber stocks renders the degraded forests prone to conversion to other land uses. Although it is essential to preserve undisturbed primary forests through the creation of protected areas, these areas alone will not be able to ensure the conservation of all species on a pan-tropical scale, for social, economic and political reasons. The conservation of tropical forests of tomorrow will mostly take place within human-modified (logged, domesticated) forests. In this context, silvicultural interventions are considered by many tropical foresters and forest ecologists as tools capable of effectively conserving tropical forest biodiversity and ecosystem services while stimulating forest production. This systematic review aims to assess past and current evidence of the impact of silviculture on tropical forests and to identify silvicultural practices appropriate for the current conditions in the forests and forestry sectors of the Congo Basin, Amazonia and Southeast Asia. Methods: This systematic review will undertake an extensive search of literature to assess the relative effectiveness of different silvicultural interventions on timber production and the conservation value of forests, and to determine whether there is a relationship between sustainability of timber harvesting and the maintenance/conservation of other ecosystem services and biodiversity in production forests. Data will be extracted for meta-analysis of at least sub-sets of the review questions. Findings are expected to help inform policy and develop evidence-based practice guidelines on silvicultural practices in tropical forests. © 2015 Petrokofsky et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Biodiversity; Conservation; Silviculture; Sustainable forest management; Tropical forests","Petrokofsky, G.; University of OxfordUnited Kingdom; email: gillian.petrokofsky@zoo.ox.ac.uk",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950292045

However, more than one-third of tropical forests have been logged, with dramatic impacts on rainforest biodiversity that may disrupt key ecosystem processes. We find that the contribution of invertebrates to three ecosystem processes operating at three trophic levels (litter decomposition, seed predation and removal, and invertebrate predation) is reduced by up to one-half following logging. These changes are associated with decreased abundance of key functional groups of termites, ants, beetles and earthworms, and an increase in the abundance of small mammals, amphibians and insectivorous birds in logged relative to primary forest. Our results suggest that ecosystem processes themselves have considerable resilience to logging, but the consistent decline of invertebrate functional importance is indicative of a human-induced shift in how these ecological processes operate in tropical rainforests. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

While scholars have long explored the drivers of tropical forest loss, the case of Cambodia offers particular insights into the role of the state where transnational governance and regional integration are increasingly the norm. Given the significant role logging rents play in Cambodia's post-conflict state formation, this article explores the contemporary regime and its ongoing codependent relationship with forested land. Insights are distilled from comparative analysis of illicit logging in two ethnographic case studies. Both involve foreign investments by state-owned companies – a Chinese-backed hydropower dam and Vietnamese-owned rubber concessions – and both are nestled in prominent conservation landscapes that are managed with international donor support. Together, the cases reveal how Cambodia's current timber extraction regime works through the use and abuse of legal mechanisms associated with forest conservation and foreign investment projects, and the mobilization of elite alliances that log both for private gain and in service of the ruling party's interests. By implication, the government's remarkable facilitation of transnational projects for conservation and development must be reappraised and ultimately seen as constitutive of a predatory and extractive regime that continues to rely heavily upon illicit logging revenues. © 2015 BCAS, Inc.","Cambodia; extractive regime; logging; predation; state formation","Milne, S.; Resources Environment and Development Group, Australia; email: sarah.milne@anu.edu.au",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929722090

Many carbon stock studies have either focused exclusively on live standing biomass or have been carried out in primary forests that are unaffected by logging, despite the fact that coarse woody debris (deadwood with ≥10 cm diameter) can contain significant portions of a forest's carbon stock. We used a field-based assessment to quantify how the relative contribution of deadwood to total above-ground carbon stock changes across a disturbance gradient, from unlogged old-growth forest to severely degraded twice-logged forest, to oil palm plantation. We measured in 193 vegetation plots (25 × 25 m), equating to a survey area of >12 ha of tropical humid forest located within the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems Project area, in Sabah, Malaysia. Our results indicate that significant amounts of carbon are stored in deadwood across forest stands. Live tree carbon storage decreased exponentially with increasing forest degradation 7-10 years after logging while deadwood accounted for >50% of above-ground carbon stocks in salvage-logged forest stands, more than twice the proportion commonly assumed in the literature. This carbon will be released as decomposition proceeds. Given the high rates of deforestation and degradation presently occurring in Southeast Asia, our findings have important implications for the calculation of current carbon stocks and sources as a result of human-modification of tropical forests. Assuming similar patterns are prevalent throughout the tropics, our data may indicate a significant global challenge to calculating global carbon fluxes, as selectively-logged forests now represent more than one third of all standing tropical humid forests worldwide. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","above-ground carbon; Malaysia; selective logging; Southeast Asia; Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems Project; tropical humid forests; woody debris","Pfeifer, M.; Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, Silwood Park Campus, Buckhurst Road, United Kingdom",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928797707

Reduced-impact logging (RIL) is being promoted as best practice forestry that increases sustainability and lowers CO2 emissions from logging, by reducing collateral damage associated with timber extraction. RIL is also expected to minimize the impacts of selective logging on biodiversity, although this is yet to be thoroughly tested. We undertake the most comprehensive study to date to investigate the biodiversity impacts of RIL across multiple taxonomic groups. We quantified birds, bats and large mammal assemblage structures, using a before-after control-impact (BACI) design across 20 sample sites over a 5-year period. Faunal surveys utilized point counts, mist nets and line transects and yielded &gt;250 species. We examined assemblage responses to logging, as well as partitions of feeding guild and strata (understorey vs. canopy), and then tested for relationships with logging intensity to assess the primary determinants of community composition. Community analysis revealed little effect of RIL on overall assemblages, as structure and composition were similar before and after logging, and between logging and control sites. Variation in bird assemblages was explained by natural rates of change over time, and not logging intensity. However, when partitioned by feeding guild and strata, the frugivorous and canopy bird ensembles changed as a result of RIL, although the latter was also associated with change over time. Bats exhibited variable changes post-logging that were not related to logging, whereas large mammals showed no change at all. Indicator species analysis and correlations with logging intensities revealed that some species exhibited idiosyncratic responses to RIL, whilst abundance change of most others was associated with time. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates the relatively benign effect of reduced-impact logging (RIL) on birds, bats and large mammals in a neotropical forest context, and therefore, we propose that forest managers should improve timber extraction techniques more widely. If RIL is extensively adopted, forestry concessions could represent sizeable and important additions to the global conservation estate - over 4 million km2. © 2015 The Authors.","BACI; Bat; Before-after control-impact; Bird; Feeding guild; Forest disturbance; Forestry; Guyana; RIL; Sustainable forest management","Bicknell, J.E.; Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (DICE), United Kingdom; email: J.E.Bicknell-57@kent.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924457247

We investigated the impacts of these two factors on the different stages of the seed dispersal cycle, including abundance of plants and their dispersers and dispersal of seeds and recruitment, in a tropical forest in north-east India. We focused on hornbills, which are important seed dispersers in these forests, and their food tree species. We compared abundances of hornbill food tree species in a site with high logging and hunting pressures (heavily disturbed) with a site that had no logging and relatively low levels of hunting (less disturbed) to understand logging impacts on hornbill food tree abundance.We compared hornbill abundances across these two sites. We, then, compared the scatter-dispersed seed arrival of five large-seeded tree species and the recruitment of four of those species. Abundances of hornbill food trees that are preferentially targeted by logging were two times higher in the less disturbed site as compared to the heavily disturbed site while that of hornbills was 22 times higher. The arrival of scatter-dispersed seeds was seven times higher in the less disturbed site. Abundances of recruits of two tree species were significantly higher in the less disturbed site. For another species, abundances of younger recruits were significantly lower while that of older recruits were higher in the heavily disturbed site. Our findings suggest that logging reduces food plant abundance for an important frugivore-seed disperser group, while hunting diminishes disperser abundances, with an associated reduction in seed arrival and altered recruitment of animal-dispersed tree species in the disturbed site. Based on our results, we present a conceptual model depicting the relationships and pathways between vertebrate-dispersed trees, their dispersers, and the impacts of hunting and logging on these pathways. © 2015 Naniwadekar et al.",,,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924956339

Industrial drivers of forest conversion, such as logging, large-scale soy and cattle farming, oil-palm plantations, and oil and gas development, have escalated in importance, buoyed by rapid globalization, economic growth, and rising standards of living in developing nations. Biofuels are likely to grow rapidly as a driver of future forest destruction. Climate change is similarly emerging as a potentially serious driver of change in the tropics, and many species, including certain amphibians, primates, and plants, are being harmed by emerging pathogens. In general, old-growth forests are vanishing rapidly and being replaced by fragmented, secondary, and selectively logged forests, particularly in impoverished tropical countries. Road expansion continues apace and is increasingly imperiling the world's last tropical frontiers. Human population growth, especially in developing nations, remains an important underlying threat to forests. These various environmental dangers often operate in concert, magnifying their impacts and posing an even greater threat to tropical forests and their biodiversity.","Biodiversity; biofuels; China; climatechange; deforestation; emergingpathogens; humanpopulationgrowth; industrialization; logging; overconsumption","Laurance, W.F.; Centre for Tropical Environmental and Sustainability Science, Australia; email: bill.laurance@jcu.edu.au",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924993520

Further, anthropogenic activities in the coastal zones are accentuating environmental degradation causing widespread suffering. Cyclones and tornadoes in particular damage infrastructures and crops every year affecting the economy of the country negatively. Some naturally adapted plants as well as landscapes usually reduce the speed of cyclones and tornadoes and thus, protect the coastal zones. However, human activities have destroyed many of the forests and landscapes. Sundarbans and Chokoria Sundarbans mangrove forests of Bangladesh are under a great threat of extinction due to illicit logging and agricultural expansion. At least 34 plant species of tropical forest are on the verge of extinction. Many animals e.g., cats, bears, porcupines, wild boars, pythons and anteaters are in the process of being wiped out from the coastal areas. Among the marine and coastal species, Red crabs, jelly-fish, sharks, and dolphins are also rare but these were the major species prior to 1980s. This study revealed that during the recent decades there has been massive plantations and construction of embankment and polderization but these and other measures have been found to be impractical and ineffective in reducing disasters in coastal areas. There is a need for integration of traditional coping practices and wisdoms with modern approaches. Available knowledge on some of these traditional practices has been documented for establishing a sustainable policy for management of coastal zones of Bangladesh. By combining traditional and scientific management of coastal ecosystem with mangroves and other plants following triple-tier mechanism and habitat, it is possible to reduce the effects of natural and climate change-induced disasters. Under such a management system, the entire coastal zone can be made more productive and sustainable. © 2015 The Authors.","Coastal zone; Excavation of fresh water reservoir; Mangroves; Triple-tier mechanism","Ataur Rahman, M.; Centre for Global Environmental Culture (CGEC), 4 Embankment Drive Road, Sector 10, Bangladesh; email: marahman@iubat.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928771614

In the tropics, frequent cloud cover and the challenge of quantifying forest degradation remain problematic. In this study, we detect processes of deforestation, forest degradation and successional dynamics, using long-wavelength radar (L-band from ALOS PALSAR) backscatter. We present a detection algorithm that allows for repeated disturbances on the same land, and identifies areas with slow- and fast-recovering changes in backscatter in close spatial and temporal proximity. In the study area in Madre de Dios, Peru, 2.3% of land was found to be disturbed over three years, with a false positive rate of 0.3% of area. A low, but significant, detection rate of degradation from sparse and small-scale selective logging was achieved. Disturbances were most common along the tri-national Interoceanic Highway, as well as in mining areas and areas under no land use allocation. A continuous spatial gradient of disturbance was observed, highlighting artefacts arising from imposing discrete boundaries on deforestation events. The magnitude of initial radar backscatter, and backscatter decrease, suggested that large-scale deforestation was likely in areas with initially low biomass, either naturally or since already under anthropogenic use. Further, backscatter increases following disturbance suggested that radar can be used to characterize successional disturbance dynamics, such as biomass accumulation in lands post-abandonment. The presented radar-based detection algorithm is spatially and temporally scalable, and can support monitoring degradation and deforestation in tropical rainforests with the use of products from ALOS-2 and the future SAOCOM and BIOMASS missions. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","ALOS PALSAR; deforestation; forest degradation; forest disturbance detection; Peru; radar backscatter","Joshi, N.; Department of GeoSciences and Natural Resource Management, University of CopenhagenDenmark",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925432619

Dammed streams accumulate water, which floods the surrounding forest creating ponds and swamps, which are slow to recover to a condition that maximises their conservation value. In particular, ponds remain relatively anoxic and the self-recovery of swamps is slow due to delayed colonisation by swamp tolerant species. The Harapan Rainforest ecosystem restoration concession in Sumatra is a clear example of this issue. Within the 100,000 ha of lowland rain forest, four watersheds are present with more than 750 km of rivers and their tributaries. Across this area more than 175 artificial ponds and swamps have been created through the construction ofthe road network over the past 30-40 years. Despite the artificial nature of their creation there is a significant conservation value in improving the alluvialswamps due to the significant decline in extent of this habitat across Southeast Asia. However,tropical forest streams too have been widely degraded and are a conservation priority due to the uniqueness of their associated biodiversity. As such, we propose the restoration of these habitats through the drainage of ponds to improve stream flow and connectivity and the establishment of swamp specialist tree species. An approach for identifying sites suitable for restoration is presented focusing on making comparisons with 'model' streams and swamps. Restoration techniques are proposed, including a listof swamp species suitable for planting trials at swamp sites and techniques for the suppression of disturbance responsive species, such as bamboos, ferns and lianas. We stress that pond restoration activities in general should always include unmanaged control ponds to enable the measurement of the additional benefit of restoration activities beyond that of natural recovery. © Lars Schmidt, Djoko prasetyonohadi and Tom Swinfield.","Alluvial swamp forest; Southeast Asia; Stream restoration; Tropical forest ponds","Schmidt, L.; University of Copenhagen, 'Forest, Nature and Biomass' Rolighedsvej 23, Denmark; email: lsc@ign.ku.dk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925377824

Because Singapore suffered these same impacts in the 19th century, it can act as an early warning system for the region. We identified invasive exotic tree species from a comprehensive survey, assessed their survival and growth in the open and under a forest canopy, and compared their traits with native pioneers and widely planted exotic species that have failed to naturalize. Nine species were invasive: Acacia auriculiformis (ear-leaf acacia), Cecropia pachystachya (trumpet tree), Falcataria moluccana (Moluccan albizia), Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena), Manihot carthaginensis subp. glaziovii (Ceara rubber tree), Muntingia calabura (Jamaican cherry tree), Piper aduncum (spiked pepper), Pipturus argenteus (white mulberry), and Spathodea campanulata (African tulip tree). Under the forest canopy, all grew little and suffered high (75-100%) mortality, with Spathodea surviving best. At the open site, mortality was low (0-25%) and height growth rapid (1.6-8.6 cm wk-1), with Leucaena growing fastest. The only significant trait difference between native pioneer trees and invasive exotics was the dispersal syndrome; none of the common native pioneers are wind dispersed, while two invasive species are. Among exotics, there were highly significant differences between invasive and non-invasive species in wood density and seed size, with invasive species having only 54% of the mean wood density and 19% of the dry seed mass of non-invasive species. Invasive exotics were also significantly farther from their native ranges than non-invasive species. None of these invasive tree species is a direct threat to the integrity of native closed-canopy forest, but they dominate on newly abandoned land and may pre-empt the recovery of native forest on such sites. © Le T.

In Indonesia alone, an estimated 25 million ha of former logging concessions are without current management, representing a huge opportunity for biodiversity conservation. However, currently such forests are typically converted to plantations. Realising the restoration potential of these forests will require viable business models that couple restoration goals with income generation. Unfortunately, understanding of natural succession trajectories and cost-effectiveness of restoration interventions remains poor. We present an overview of research, including three planned experiments designed to test the economic viability of large-scale restoration treatments, in a former logging concession at Harapan Rainforest (98,455 ha), Indonesia. These experiments will address the following questions: (1) Can the selective removal of pioneer trees, including an invasive species, be used to accelerate succession; (2) how does the functional diversity of the planted matrix affect growth and survival of a high value target species; and (3) how does seed density affect recruitment success in direct seeding treatments? Treatments will be applied to large compartments (4~8 ha) to reduce edge effects and simplify management. Monitoring plots (20 x 20 m x 5 reps) within each compartment will be used to assess silvicultural responses, while changes in biodiversity and carbon storage will be monitored at the compartment level. The large spatial scale and high replication of the treatments will establish an experimental platform that will inform many different aspects of tropical forest ecology. © Rhett D.

Science 342: 850-853). Although this data set has been criticized for inaccuracies in distinguishing vegetation types at the local scale, it remains a valuable source of forest cover information for areas where local data is severely lacking. Masoala National Park, in northeastern Madagascar, is an example of a region for which very little spatially explicit forest cover information is available. Yet, this extremely diverse tropical humid forest is undergoing a dramatic rate of forest degradation and deforestation through illegal selective logging of rosewood and ebony, slash-and-burn agriculture, and damage due to cyclones. All of these processes result in relatively diffuse and small-scale changes in forest cover. In this paper, we examine to what extent Hansen et al.'s global forest change data set captures forest loss within Masoala National Park by comparing its performance to a locally calibrated, object-oriented classification approach. We verify both types of classification with substantial ground truthing. We find that both the global and local classifications perform reasonably well in detecting small-scale slash-and-burn agriculture, but neither performs adequately in detecting selective logging. We conclude that since the use of the global forest change data set requires very little technical and financial investment, and performs almost as well as the more resource-demanding, locally calibrated classification, it may be advantageous to use the global forest change data set even for local conservation purposes. © 2015 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","Cyclone; Geographic Information System; Object-oriented classification; Selective logging; Slash-and-burn agriculture; Tropical forest","Burivalova, Z.; Department of Environmental Systems Science, China; email: zuzana.burivalova@env.ethz.ch",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924270916

In this ~5 million km2 area, over 750 000 km2 of forest and ~240 000 km2 of nonforest vegetation types had been cleared through 2013. We estimate current carbon stocks and cumulative gross carbon loss from clearing of premodern vegetation in Brazil's 'Legal Amazonia' and 'Amazonia biome' regions. Biomass of 'premodern' vegetation (prior to major increases in disturbance beginning in the 1970s) was estimated by matching vegetation classes mapped at a scale of 1 : 250 000 and 29 biomass means from 41 published studies for vegetation types classified as forest (2317 1-ha plots) and as either nonforest or contact zones (1830 plots and subplots of varied size). Total biomass (above and below-ground, dry weight) underwent a gross reduction of 18.3% in Legal Amazonia (13.1 Pg C) and 16.7% in the Amazonia biome (11.2 Pg C) through 2013, excluding carbon loss from the effects of fragmentation, selective logging, fires, mortality induced by recent droughts and clearing of forest regrowth. In spite of the loss of carbon from clearing, large amounts of carbon were stored in stands of remaining vegetation in 2013, equivalent to 149 Mg C ha-1 when weighted by the total area covered by each vegetation type in Legal Amazonia. Native vegetation in Legal Amazonia in 2013 originally contained 58.6 Pg C, while that in the Amazonia biome contained 56 Pg C. Emissions per unit area from clearing could potentially be larger in the future because previously cleared areas were mainly covered by vegetation with lower mean biomass than the remaining vegetation. Estimates of original biomass are essential for estimating losses to forest degradation. This study offers estimates of cumulative biomass loss, as well as estimates of premodern carbon stocks that have not been represented in recent estimates of deforestation impacts. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","REDD; Amazon forest; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Tropical forest","Fearnside, P.M.; Department of Environmental Dynamics, Av.

Each plot was 0.25 ha; 28 plots were established in primary evergreen forests and four were established in secondary dry deciduous forests.

Within communities, logging decreased phylogenetic diversity, and increased overall phylogenetic clustering and terminal phylogenetic evenness. Between communities, logging increased phylogenetic similarity between evergreen and deciduous plots. On the other hand, recruitment had opposite effects both within and between communities. The observed patterns can be explained by environmental homogenization under logging.

We established four 0.5-ha plots on each site and calculated the biomass.

Bushmeat hunting and logging occur extensively in tropical forests and have large effects on particular species. But how they alter animal diversity across landscape scales and whether their impacts are correlated across species remain less known. We used spatially widespread measurements of mammal occurrence across Malaysian Borneo and recently developed multispecies hierarchical models to assess the species richness of medium- to large-bodied terrestrial mammals while accounting for imperfect detection of all species. Hunting was associated with 31% lower species richness. Moreover, hunting remained high even where richness was very low, highlighting that hunting pressure persisted even in chronically overhunted areas. Newly logged sites had 11% lower species richness than unlogged sites, but sites logged >10 years previously had richness levels similar to those in old-growth forest. Hunting was a more serious long-term threat than logging for 91% of primate and ungulate species. Hunting and logging impacts across species were not correlated across taxa. Negative impacts of hunting were the greatest for common mammalian species, but commonness versus rarity was not related to species-specific impacts of logging. Direct human impacts appeared highly persistent and lead to defaunation of certain areas. These impacts were particularly severe for species of ecological importance as seed dispersers and herbivores. Indirect impacts were also strong but appeared to attenuate more rapidly than previously thought.

Corridors intended to facilitate the movement of multiple species could increase persistence of entire communities, but at the likely cost of being less efficient for any given species than a corridor intended specifically for that species. There have been few tests of the trade-offs between single- and multispecies corridor approaches. We assessed single-species and multispecies habitat corridors for 5 threatened mammal species in tropical forests of Borneo. We generated maps of the cost of movement across the landscape for each species based on the species' local abundance as estimated through hierarchical modeling of camera-trap data with biophysical and anthropogenic covariates. Elevation influenced local abundance of banded civets (Hemigalus derbyanus) and sun bears (Helarctos malayanus). Increased road density was associated with lower local abundance of Sunda clouded leopards (Neofelis diardi) and higher local abundance of sambar deer (Rusa unicolor). Pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) local abundance was lower in recently logged areas. An all-species-combined connectivity scenario with least-cost paths and 1 km buffers generated total movement costs that were 27% and 23% higher for banded civets and clouded leopards, respectively, than the connectivity scenarios for those species individually. A carnivore multispecies connectivity scenario, however, increased movement cost by 2% for banded civets and clouded leopards. Likewise, an herbivore multispecies scenario provided more effective connectivity than the all-species-combined scenario for sambar and macaques. We suggest that multispecies habitat connectivity plans be tailored to groups of ecologically similar, disturbance-sensitive species to maximize their effectiveness. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.","Animal movement; Borneo; Dispersal; Fragmentation; Habitat corridor; Heart of Borneo; Logging; Multispecies conservation",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921436733

The mountain regions of Central Sulawesi experience perhumid climate conditions with few seasonal changes in precipitation, making the vegetation a possible sensitive target for future changes of precipitation patterns. The ecological consequences are hard to predict due to the lack of knowledge of the dynamical processes that govern these tropical forests. This research aims to shed light on the long-term response of the montane vegetation of Lore Lindu National Park to stress caused by climate variability and human activities in the past. Palynological data are used to reconstruct forest vegetation dynamics and are compared to centennial time scale data of fire frequencies, palaeorainfall proxies and regional climate reconstructions to assess the drivers of these changes. Results reveal that the Fagaceae family dominates the entire recorded period, as they still do today. Fire episodes occurred locally only ten times in the last 1500. years but two periods were characterized by higher frequencies: between ca. AD 1070 and 1200 and between ca. AD 1450 and 1660. The regional correlation of these events with periods of drought registered in Java suggests that centennial-scale increases in fire frequencies at Lake Kalimpaa were consequences of the vegetation being more prone to fire, probably due to more frequent or more intense El Niño events. In both cases Fagaceae did not decrease, indicating resilience towards droughts and fires of at least one species of that family. Following the first period of increased fire frequencies, the vegetation went through a long secondary forest phase lasting about two and a half centuries (ca. AD 1200-1450). Weinmannia was co-dominant together with Lithocarpus/Castanopsis. The second period of increased fire frequencies corresponds to a phase when records across the tropics show that the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) was displaced to the south. High effective rainfall enhanced the growing of swamp taxa like Pandanus around the lake. Human-landscape interactions are evident only starting from the 20th century (from ca. 1950 to present) with Weinmannia rising probably due to the logging of emergent Agathis trees and/or landslides caused by the construction of the road which today passes near the lake. In general, palynological diversity values indicate that within-landscape diversity (Whittaker's gamma diversity) decreased when fires increased. Palynological rate of change and compositional turnover indicate that the vegetation communities were more resilient to fire disturbance during period of high rainfall. A different trend is apparent starting from the second half of the 20th century, suggesting a change in the dynamical response of the vegetation communities to forest fires, possibly as a consequence of increasing human activities around the lake. The emergent tree Agathis, while being more responsive to long-term rainfall variability in the past, did not reestablish itself following the years of intensive selective logging in the second part of the last century.

Using content analysis of policy documents, this paper aims at (i) analysing the formal administrative responsibilities related to the four rainforest transformation systems and (ii) based on the informal motives of the competing bureaucracies involved generating hypotheses on their future course of action and related research. We find that based on the legal and political land use application, Indonesian tropical rainforests may fall into six categories of land use. They may be situated in both, within the forest area and land outside of the forest area in so-called title forests, even though there is a though political debate about forest area category's jurisdiction confirmation. The Ministry of Forestry, the National Land Agency, and regional governments are identified as the core bureaucracies responsible in both forest area and title forest. The Ministry of Agriculture only has responsibilities in title forests. A number of secondary bureaucracies also steering forest transformation are identified. Formal responsibilities of these bureaucracies are highly complex and fragmented regarding the tasks of forest regulation, forest administration, forest management, forest protection, issuing forest management rights, issuing land rights, regulating and administering timber product, issuing licence, and regulating the commodity. Indonesian tropical rainforest is found to potentially transform into other land uses through seven ways: (i) releasing certain area from forest area, (ii) using forest area for non-forestry purposes (e.g. palm oil plantation), (iii) maximising production forests for logging, (iv) developing community forest schemes in forest area, (v) developing plantation and agroforestry in title forest (vi) taking advantage from waste land, and (vii) steering back to native forest. The intersection of responsibilities in steering rainforest transformation has created contestation between the bureaucracies involved. We conclude that the main conflict of interests runs between the core bureaucracies in this transformation, i.e. the Ministry of Forestry, the National Land Agency, and regional governments. The authors conclude with hypotheses on future actions of such bureaucracies in light of national and international influences on rainforest transformation systems. The central hypothesis contends that both core and secondary bureaucracies have conflicting interests over all four types of tropical rainforest transformation due to the areas of overlapping responsibility. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Bureaucratic politics; Complex national administration; Dual system; Formal responsibilities; Informal interests; Palm oil; Rubber; Tropical rainforest transformation systems","Sahide, M.A.K.Busgenweg 3, Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911909214

Here, we investigate the impact of logging on mating system and genetic diversity of the low-density, thrip-pollinated, dioecious tree Bagassa guianensis within a 500-ha plot at Tapajós National Forest, Pará State, Brazil. Mating system parameters of the logged population were estimated using mixed-mating model. Six microsatellite loci were used to genotype 232 seeds from ten remnant female trees over three seasons (2006, 2007, and 2008). The data were compared with the mating system of the unlogged population of B. guianensis (18 female trees, 488 seeds) in the same plot. The overall number of alleles found in the open-pollinated progenies decreased after logging (K = 71 before logging and K = 57 after logging, considering the three after logging seasons pooled), as well as the average number of alleles per locus (A = 11.8 and 9.5, respectively). Similarly, the number of private alleles, which is defined in the context of this study as the number of alleles observed in the population exclusively before or after logging, also decreased after logging (15 and 1, respectively). However, the average number of alleles per locus and the observed and expected heterozygosities were not significantly higher before logging than after logging. Logging also did not affect the inbreeding of progenies in the population. Somewhat unexpectedly, the effective number of pollen donors was consistently higher after (Nep = 14.5 in 2006, 8.1 in 2007, and 6.3 in 2008) than before logging (Nep = 3.4), suggesting that the loss of alleles in the population was compensated by the higher heterogeneity in the pollen pool after the removal of the largest trees by logging. Potential causes explaining the patterns found here include the maintenance of large patches of forest around the logged plot and the species’ ability to perform long-distance pollination by airborne thrips. Maintenance of landscape integrity as logged and unlogged forests around the exploited areas is recommended to enhance pollen migration and to avoid long-term losses in genetic diversity. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Amazonian timber species; Forest management; Microsatellite markers; Reduced impact logging; Tapajós National Forest; Tatajuba","Gribel, R.; Laboratório de Genética e Biologia Reprodutiva de Plantas, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisa da Amazônia (INPA), Av.

The duration over which impacts of selective logging persist, however, remains an unresolved question, particularly for African forests. Here, we investigate the extent to which a past selective logging event continues to leave its imprint on different components of an East African forest 45 years later. We inventoried 2358 stems ≥10 cm in diameter in 26 plots (200 m × 10 m) within a 5.2 ha area in Kibale National Park, Uganda, in logged and unlogged forest. In these surveys, we characterized the forest light environment, taxonomic composition, functional trait composition using three traits (wood density, maximum height and maximum diameter) and forest structure based on three measures (stem density, total basal area and total above-ground biomass). In comparison to unlogged forests, selectively logged forest plots in Kibale National Park on average had higher light levels, different structure characterized by lower stem density, lower total basal area and lower above-ground biomass, and a distinct taxonomic composition driven primarily by changes in the relative abundance of species. Conversely, selectively logged forest plots were like unlogged plots in functional composition, having similar community-weighted mean values for wood density, maximum height and maximum diameter. This similarity in functional composition irrespective of logging history may be due to functional recovery of logged forest or background changes in functional attributes of unlogged forest. Despite the passage of 45 years, the legacy of selective logging on the tree community in Kibale National Park is still evident, as indicated by distinct taxonomic and structural composition and reduced carbon storage in logged forest compared with unlogged forest. The effects of selective logging are exerted via influences on tree demography rather than functional trait composition. © The Author 2015.","Functional traits; Historical logging event; Kibale National Park; Light intensity; Wood density","Osazuwa-Peters, O.L.; Department of Biology, United States; email: oletkd@mail.umsl.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983655860

Throughout the tropics, the staggering pace of deforestation, logging, and conversion of forested habitat to other land uses has created highly fragmented landscapes that are increasingly dominated by human-modified habitats and degraded forests. In this chapter, we review the responses of tropical bats to a range of land-use change scenarios, focusing on the effects of habitat fragmentation, logging, and conversion of tropical forest to various forms of agricultural production. Recent landscape-scale studies have considerably advanced our understanding of how tropical bats respond to habitat fragmentation and disturbance at the population, ensemble, and assemblage level. This research emphasizes that responses of bats are often species and ensemble specific, sensitive to spatial scale, and strongly molded by the characteristics of the prevailing landscape matrix. Nonetheless, substantial knowledge gaps exist concerning other types of response by bats. Few studies have assessed responses at the genetic, behavioral, or physiological level, with regard to disease prevalence, or the extent to which human disturbance erodes the capacity of tropical bats to provide key ecosystem services. A strong geographic bias, with Asia and, most notably, Africa, being strongly understudied, precludes a comprehensive understanding of the effects of fragmentation and disturbance on tropical bats. We strongly encourage increased research in the Paleotropics and emphasize the need for long-term studies, approaches designed to integrate multiple scales, and answering questions that are key to conserving tropical bats in an era of environmental change and dominance of modified habitats (i.e., the Anthropocene). © The Author(s) 2016.",,"Meyer, C.F.J.; Centre for Ecology, Portugal; email: cmeyer@fc.ul.pt",Book Chapter,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960351528

It is clearly necessary to offset forest losses from logging by conducting silvicultural operations to reconstitute a forest's initial composition using suitable species. Such a strategy, which is sometimes strongly opposed but would convert wild forests into forests with greater potential value, can only be applied with a view to the long term. And this is only possible if the means provided to foresters are guaranteed over the long term. Enrichment planting is justified by the small number of commercial forest species, which will still be the same species in fifty years' time because they have the best technical properties. A forest enriched with okoumé, limbo and niangon to produce 50 or 60 commercially valuable trees per hectare will therefore always have more value than a wild forest. Enrichment is also justified by the increasing rarity of the most sought-after species, which cannot regenerate under dense cover. For example, we know that the abundance of okoumé in certain areas is the result of early human settlements that have since disappeared. Enrichment is also justified as a means of preventing logging from encroaching into the entire forest and gradually destroying it. Sawmills often decimate the forest sur-rounding them, and forest roads contribute to its fragmentation until cropfields take over the soil entirely. With no listing of protected forests and no silviculture, within just a few decades there would be no more economically viable forestry and no more forest industries manufacturing timber products for export.","Aucoumea klaineana; Côte d'ivoire; Enrichment; Gulf of Guinea; Manufacturing industry; Silviculture; Tropical forest","Aubréville, A.; Dept. of Water and Forests OverseasFrance",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951283311

Thus, the conservation value of forests regenerated after harvest remains unclear, but critically important for biodiversity. We sampled trees from 164 25 × 25 m quadrats across a 160-km2 tropical rain forest landscape on Hainan Island, China, which had been clear-cut or selectively harvested and left to recover without management for up to 50 years. Species richness and species abundance distributions were compared among five successional categories to investigate changes in species richness and species abundance over time. Basal areas and three different species similarity indices were compared to reveal temporal changes in species composition and community structure. Species richness recovered faster than species composition and structure in both selectively logged and clear-cut forests. Both total number of species and number of rare species tended to increase from younger harvested forests through older harvested forests to old-growth intact forests. Within 20-40 years after harvest species composition of harvested forests tended towards that of old-growth forests, community similarity between harvested and old-growth forests decreased subsequently and basal area did not recover, given even a half-century of succession undisturbed by anthropogenic forces. Shortly after harvest, pioneer species increased rapidly, but shade-tolerant species required much more time to recover to former abundances. The shift from pioneer species to shade-tolerant species indicates significant recovery of logged forests. Selectively logged forests recovered more quickly and had higher conservation values than clear-cut forests. Synthesis and applications. Our findings indicate that logged tropical forests only partially recovered the characteristics of pre-harvest, primary forest after a half-century of succession. Recovery of the original tree biodiversity on such post-harvest landscapes will be slow at best, if measured by species composition or stand structure. Our study amplifies the importance of conserving tropical forest integrity and developing harvest and management approaches that facilitate full recovery of logged tropical forests.

LiDAR is able to measure fine-scale variations in forest structure over multiple kilometers. We use LiDAR data from ca. 16 km2 of forest in Sierra Leone, West Africa, to discriminate areas of old-growth from areas recovering from selective logging for 23 years. We examined canopy height variation and gap size distributions. We found that though recovering blocks of forest differed little in height from old-growth forest (up to 3 m), they had a greater area of canopy gaps (average 10.2% gap fraction in logged areas, compared to 5.6% in unlogged area); and greater numbers of gaps penetrating to the forest floor (162 gaps at 2 m height in logged blocks, and 101 in an unlogged block). Comparison of LiDAR measurements with field data demonstrated that LiDAR delivered accurate results. We found that gap size distributions deviated from power-laws reported previously, with substantially fewer large gaps than predicted by power-law functions. Our analyses demonstrate that LiDAR is a useful tool for distinguishing structural differences between old-growth and old-secondary forests. That makes LiDAR a powerful tool for REDD+ (Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) programs implementation and conservation planning. © 2015 by the authors.","Gap size frequency distribution; Gola rainforest national park; LiDAR; MCMC; Moist tropical forest; Old growth forest; Power-law; Re-growth forest; Selective logging; Sierra leone","Kent, R.; Forest Ecology and Conservation Group, Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, Downing St., United Kingdom",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937907482

It is one of the symbolic species in tropical mountain rain forest in Hainan Island and one of the key species to maintain the natural communities in that region. Its distribution range is very narrow and it can only be found in the forest region of Bawang Mountain, Jianfengling Mountain and Diaoluoshan Mountain. From the beginning of 1960s, the natural forest of D. pectinatum has been severely damaged because of people's massive logging of tropical forests in Hainan. As a result the distribution area of D. pectinatum has become ever smaller, the quality of D. pectinatum forest has gotten ever worse, and it has become ever harder for the D. pectinatum to naturally regenerate themselves. What's worse, there has emerged a decline in tree-age structure. Based on this situation, D. pectinatum was listed in China Rare and Endangered Plants Red Data Book as the third degree of endangered plants in 1992. The paper first defines the three stages of D. pectinatum growth based on its diameter at breast height and tree height. Specifically seedling is defined as the tree with a height under 50 cm, sapling refers to the tree with a DBH lower than 10 cm and a height over 50 cm, and matured trees are those whose DBH are larger than 10 cm. The paper used geostatistics and constrained ordination analysis method to analyze the space distribution characteristics of D. pectinatum in three life stages from the perspective that there is relevance between its space distribution in different life stages and microhabitats factors. Also, the spatial autocorrelation of 11 microhabitats is analyzed. The results showed that: 1) there was an obvious difference in the spatial distribution of D. pectinatum in its different life stages. The seedlings were in aggregating distribution and lived with significant spatial autocorrelation. However, the aggregating intensity gradually weakened with the seedlings growing into sapling and then to matured trees; 2) RDA analysis showed that there were significant differences in the relationship between the distribution patterns and microhabitat factors in different life stages of D. pectinatum, and the effect of habitat filtering varied with the change in its life stages. 3) The effect of microhabitat variables on the spatial variability of the seedling, the sapling, and the mature trees were 78.4%, 41.2%, and 33.6%, respectively. In the whole life stage, the period from the seedling to the sapling is the key to successful plant colonization. And seedlings have got stronger environmental sensitivity than the adult tree. It follows that the restrictive effect of microhabitat factors on D. pectinatum's distribution mainly occurred in its seedling stage; 4) In sound conditions, 22.2% variation can be interpreted by PCNM variables and microhabitat variables in common. And a typical 'induced spatial variation' phenomenon was found, which means that the spatial variation of microhabitat variables can result in the spatial variation of D. pectinatum throughout its seedling, sapling stage and matured stage. The results confirmed the relevance between microhabitats and the distribution of D. pectinatum in different life stages. And the paper provided a scientific foundation for better understanding of the relationship between the mechanisms of population maintenance, the spatial distribution pattern of D. pectinatum, and its regeneration dynamics. If there will be any further research on this topic, it is suggested that the monitoring and the study be carried out during a longer time span, and larger size of sample be studied, for a more accurate analysis of the influence of microhabitat factors on seedling regeneration and its survival pattern. © 2015, Ecological Society of China.

Rubber and pulp plantations threaten Hainan Island's natural tropical forests. Remote sensing provides a crucial tool for understanding how forests change in response to forest protection strategies and economic development. China's government has adopted protective measures designed to balance forest protection and economic development on Hainan; however, the effect of both management and economic development on natural tropical forest remains unclear. To identify changes in forest types, object-oriented decision-tree identification techniques were developed using Landsat TM images to identify causes of forest change. GIS techniques allowed analysis of the forest's spatial shift using elevation, slope, transportation corridors, natural reserves, and farmlands linked to three different periods of forestry policy and economic development from 1988 to 2008. The analysis shows: (1) Total tropical forest area increased from 1988 to 2008, while natural tropical forest area increased slightly from 1988 to 1998, but decreased significantly from 1998 to 2008, despite implementation of the ""Natural Forest Protection Project."" Meanwhile, economic forests, mainly rubber and pulp plantations, expanded from 1988 to 2008. (2) Spatial changes occurred. Natural tropical forest shifted from the lower piedmont to higher mountain-tops, and economic forests shifted to higher elevations under the complex effects of multiple factors. (3) The observed changes in forest cover could be related to protective measures and economic development, with economic development seemingly having the strongest influence on the condition of the forests. Elevation, slope, transportation corridors, and farmlands also affected the shift of tropical forests.","Forest management; GIS; Impact factor; Multiple forests transition; Object oriented decision tree technique; Remote sensing","Wang, S.; State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth (RADI), CASChina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927709990

By contrast, selective logging of tropical forests is often regarded as having a lesser impact on the ecosystem particularly in long terms, even though there have been few critical evaluations of the practice, particularly in Africa. We compared field data from 511 plots in the tropical forest of Sierra Leone, Ghana, Cameroon and Gabon. These plots were subject to different forest management practices: no recent logging (primary forests), selective logging (up to 30 years old) and re-grown secondary forests post clear-cutting (at least 20 years ago). Our findings suggest that the vertical structure and plant richness of the selectively logged and secondary forests change in different amplitude from those of primary forests, but stem density and the prevalence of vine and weed species differ greatly. We show that the effects of selective logging are greater than those expected simply from the removal of commercial species, and can persist for decades. Selective logging, unless it is practiced at very low harvest intensities, can significantly reduce the biomass of a tropical forest for many decades, seriously diminishing aboveground carbon storage capacity, and create opportunities for weeds and vines to spread and slow down the ecological succession. © 2014, The Ecological Society of Japan.","Africa; Biodiversity; Biomass; Forest degradation; Selective logging; Tropical forests","Cazzolla Gatti, R.; Department for Innovation in Biological, Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925519964

The genetic and demographic effects of selective logging on two Amazonian timber species (Dipteryx odorata Leguminosae, Jacaranda copaia Bignoniaceae) with contrasting ecological and reproductive characteristics were assessed in the same forest. Genetic diversity and gene flow were characterized by genotyping adults and seed sampled before and after logging, using hypervariable microsatellite markers. Overall, there were no short-term genetic impacts on the J. copaia population, with commercial application of current Brazilian forest management regulations. In contrast, for D. Odorata, selective logging showed a range of genetic impacts, with a 10% loss of alleles, and reductions in siring by pollen from trees within the 546-ha study area (23-11%) and in the number of pollen donors per progeny array (2.8-1.6), illustrating the importance of the surrounding landscape. Asynchrony in flowering between D. odorata trees led to trees with no breeding partners, which could limit the species reproduction and regeneration under current regulations.

We used camera trapping and hierarchical models to compare local abundance of a variety of terrestrial mammal species in Borneo between selectively logged and unlogged forest, and to assess the impacts of edge effects. Our methods circumvent confounding factors that have plagued previous assessments of logging impacts by explicitly accounting for differential detection probability among habitats, separating the effects of hunting from those of logging-induced habitat disturbance, and explicitly measuring the distances over which edge effects occur. We found that mammalian carnivore species were either largely or completely confined to primary forest, although habitat use for the Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi) increased toward the ecotone. Several large ungulates, however, were either completely (elephant Elephas maximus and banteng Bos javanicus) or mostly (sambar Rusa unicolor) found in logged forest. This suggests that, in the absence of hunting, disturbed habitats can be important for the conservation of certain endangered and vulnerable species. Sambar and muntjac (Muntiacus spp.) both strongly avoided habitat edge in logged forest and primary forest, respectively. Lower habitat use by these species persisted 2-4. km from the habitat boundary - farther than has been observed for the infiltration of other edge effects such as canopy desiccation. Such avoidance of ecotones implies that 20-40% of the intact primary forest habitat in our study area is actually degraded ""edge habitat"" from the point of view of primary forest specialists. Our results suggest that, while selectively logged forests retain conservation value for certain large mammal species, it is critical that thresholds in logging intensity be identified so as to avoid declines in habitat use by taxa, such as carnivores, which appear intolerant of intensive logging pressure. © 2014 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.","Habitat disturbance; Habitat selection; Mammal conservation; Southeast Asia; Tropical rainforest","Brodie, J.F.; Department of Zoology, BC, Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920741746

The case study was undertaken within traditional communities located in Boa Vista do Ramos County, Amazonas State. With environmental issues surrounding tropical forest becoming increasingly disputed, traditional logging activities performed by locals came to be regarded as illegal. We believe that despite significant efforts to promote CFM initiatives, principally undertaken via public policy, small loggers have in fact had little success adapting to this new legal context. The results demonstrated that when small-scale loggers where supported by specific regulations and some external assistance they were able to collectivize their activities, forming the Community Association of Agricultural and Forest Products Harvesting (ACAF). After meeting challenges to strengthen their technical, social and managerial aspects, ACAF obtained environmental licenses and forest certification. However subsequent changes in forest policies lead to the termination of CFM-oriented regulations and ACAF weakened. Nevertheless, the social and human capital that had been developed in the collective ended up being successfully applied to other individual small-scale projects in the same region. We conclude that despite the community loggers' success in establishing a new and more sustainable way of working, they were not able to continue these activities within this new legal environment. The policies and laws that apply to CFM are more oriented to conservation goals than to meeting the demands of producers and contributing to their livelihoods. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Community forestry; Environmental licensing; Forest policies; Tropical Forest Management","Waldhoff, P.; Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Amazonas, Av. 7 de Setembro, 1975 - Centro, Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919483471

The assessment is guided by an analytical framework that predicts the relevance and receptiveness of different timber supply chains to current systems of trade-based governance. We find that Brazil's efforts to control illegal deforestation through satellite monitoring have contributed significantly to reducing deforestation, but the effects on degradation are less clear. Efforts focused on the timber supply chain, including certification and legal verification of traded timber, have been limited by the fragmented nature of Amazonian wood production. Both certification and legality verification favor large producers and concentrated supply chains destined for external markets (e.g. pulp and paper and high-value tropical sawnwood), while extensive legal requirements inhibit local benefit-capture. In order to prevent the means of forest governance (i.e. certification and law enforcement) from trumping its commonly stated ends (sustainable forest management and local welfare), there is a need to prioritize the generation of local benefit from locally adapted production systems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Certification; Forest; Governance; Illegal logging; Legality; Supply chain","McDermott, C.L.; James Martin Senior Fellow, Environmental Change Institute, University of OxfordUnited Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919463887

However, significant threats from anthropogenic activities and decline of wildlife populations persist, while conservation efforts in most PAs are still minimal. We assessed the impact level of the most common threats to wildlife within PAs in tropical Africa and the relationship of conservation activities with threat impact level. We collated data on 98 PAs with tropical forest cover from 15 countries across West, Central and East Africa. For this, we assembled information about local threats as well as conservation activities from published and unpublished literature, and questionnaires sent to long-term field workers. We constructed general linear models to test the significance of specific conservation activities in relation to the threat impact level. Subsistence and commercial hunting were identified as the most common direct threats to wildlife and found to be most prevalent in West and Central Africa. Agriculture and logging represented the most common indirect threats, and were most prevalent in West Africa. We found that the long-term presence of conservation activities (such as law enforcement, research and tourism) was associated with lower threat impact levels. Our results highlight deficiencies in the management effectiveness of several PAs across tropical Africa, and conclude that PA management should invest more into conservation activities with long-term duration.

First, land-use changes and agricultural activities were analyzed using Landsat and IKO-NOS-2 data from 1990 to 2010. Then, a decision tree algorithm was developed to map under canopy invasive plant species using high resolution optical stereo imaging, land-use classification, and characterizing plant growth using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and polarimetric InSAR observations from Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR). Next, causal association between land use, climate change, and spatial and temporal dynamics of invasive plant species distribution was explored using satellite derived and in situ climate variables, changes in drought regimes, and tropical cyclones. Results showed that the region experienced intense land-use changes characterized by significant increase in agricultural lands at the cost of primary forest and other land-cover types. Encroachment by habitat-altering invasive plants from 2005 to 2012 within the reserve was obvious, and were probably attributable to illegal logging, erosion of the reserve boundary from anthropogenic activities and cyclone damage as well as shifts in drought regimes. The spatial extent of guava (Psidium cattleianum ) has increased from 5.6% of the reserve in 2005 to 7.9% in 2012, a 55-ha increase over less than 7 years.

To understand what determines regeneration success of timber species in the Congo Basin, we evaluated whether seedling recruitment rates differed between forest logged 30 years previously and unlogged forest and determined the environmental factors that influence seedling density, growth and survival. We monitored the fate of 2186 seedlings of seven timber species within 462, 25-m2 plots located along 21 transects. We characterized seedling plots by light availability, soil nutrient availability and pH, and abundance of mammalian herbivores and then used linear and generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the variables that influenced seedling density, growth and survival. Light availability and canopy openness were 18% and 81% higher in logged than unlogged forest, and concentration of soil nutrients varied between sites. Seedling density was 32% higher in unlogged than logged forest. Taking all species together, seedling survival was positively correlated with calcium and negatively with magnesium and available phosphorus. Rates of seedling growth increased with available light. Taken separately, seedlings of the selected timber species responded differently to abiotic and biotic factors, demonstrating species-specific regeneration requirements. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Congo forest; Forest management; Light availability; Natural regeneration; Soil nutrients; Timber species","Medjibe, V.P.; Agence Nationale des Parcs Nationaux, B.P. 20379, Gabon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939252418

In this study, we evaluated the seed shadow of eight small remnant Swietenia macrophylla trees to determine the possible consequences of selective logging on the first stages of natural regeneration. We expected to find a restricted dispersal ability and a marked loss of seeds due to biotic interactions. To test this, seed shadow per tree was quantified along four radial transects (30 × 1 m) that provided 960-1m2 squares for sampling. The wind direction and some tree characteristics as diameter at breast height and crown projection area were also considered as factors influencing seed shadow. We also scored the number of seeds predated or infested by fungi. In total, 540 seeds were found along transects. Around 86.1% of the 960 squares presented 0 or 1 seed, whereas 80% of the seeds were found within the first 20 m from the parent tree. The number of seeds lost through biotic interactions regressed on the distance to the parent tree fitted a quadratic model that explained 52.4% of the total variance. These results suggest that small remnant S. macrophylla trees display low dispersal ability caused by a restricted seed shadow and a high rate of seed damaged produced by biotic interactions. Therefore, removal of largest trees for trading could be negatively impacting the first stages of the natural regeneration of this high value species. Consequently, harvesting could threat the local permanence of S. macrophylla in these managed forests of the Mayan zone.","Big-leaf mahogany; Biotic interactions; Harvesting; Natural regeneration; Seed dispersal; Seed predation; Selective logging; Tropical forests management","Gutiérrez-Granados, G.; Laboratorio de Sistemas de Información Geográfica, Mexico; email: gabgg@st.ib.unam.mx",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924728131

In a recent pan-tropical assessment, Burivalova et al. [2] demonstrate the importance of logging intensity as a driver of biodiversity decline in timber estates. Their analyses reveal that species richness of some taxa could decline by 50% at harvest intensities of 38 m3 ha-1. However, they did not consider the extraction techniques that lead to these intensities. Here, we conduct a complementary meta-analysis of assemblage responses to differing logging practices: conventional logging and reduced-impact logging. We show that biodiversity impacts are markedly less severe in forests that utilise reduced-impact logging, compared to those using conventional methods. While supporting the initial findings of Burivalova et al. [2], we go on to demonstrate that best practice forestry techniques curtail the effects of timber extraction regardless of intensity. Therefore, harvest intensities are not always indicative of actual disturbance levels resulting from logging. Accordingly, forest managers and conservationists should advocate practices that offer reduced collateral damage through best practice extraction methods, such as those used in reduced-impact logging. Large-scale implementation of this approach would lead to improved conservation values in the 4 million km2 of tropical forests that are earmarked for timber extraction [3]. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Given that the majority of tropical landscapes have been or will likely be logged, the protection of biodiversity within tropical forests thus depends on whether species can persist in these economically exploited lands, and if species cannot persist, whether we can protect enough primary forest from logging and conversion. However, our knowledge of the impact of logging and conversion on biodiversity is limited to a few taxa, often sampled in different locations with complex land-use histories, hampering attempts to plan cost-effective conservation strategies and to draw conclusions across taxa. Spanning a land-use gradient of primary forest, once- and twice-logged forests, and oil palm plantations, we used traditional sampling and DNA metabarcoding to compile an extensive data set in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo for nine vertebrate and invertebrate taxa to quantify the biological impacts of logging and oil palm, develop cost-effective methods of protecting biodiversity, and examine whether there is congruence in response among taxa. Logged forests retained high species richness, including, on average, 70% of species found in primary forest. In contrast, conversion to oil palm dramatically reduces species richness, with significantly fewer primary-forest species than found on logged forest transects for seven taxa.Using a systematic conservation planning analysis, we show that efficient protection of primary-forest species is achieved with land portfolios that include a large proportion of logged-forest plots. Protecting logged forests is thus a cost-effective method of protecting an ecologically and taxonomically diverse range of species, particularly when conservation budgets are limited. Six indicator groups (birds, leaf-litter ants, beetles, aerial hymenopterans, flies, and true bugs) proved to be consistently good predictors of the response of the other taxa to logging and oil palm. Our results confidently establish the high conservation value of logged forests and the low value of oil palm. Cross-taxon congruence in responses to disturbance also suggests that the practice of focusing on key indicator taxa yields important information of general biodiversity in studies of logging and oil palm. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America","Cost-effective conservation; Indicator taxa; Oil palm plantation agriculture; Sabah, Malaysian Borneo; Selective logging; Southeast Asia; Timber concessions; Tropical rain forest",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919385879

However, the application of automated methods to large area assessments remains a major challenge. To-date, nearly all large area assessments of forest degradation in the region have included a strong visual interpretation component. We conclude that due to the variety of forest types and forest disturbance levels, as well as the variable image acquisition conditions in Southeast Asia, it is unlikely that forest degradation monitoring can be conducted throughout the region using a single automated approach with currently available remote sensing data. The provision of regionally consistent information on forest degradation from satellite remote sensing data remains therefore challenging.

Currently, tropical forest conservation, science, policies, and climate mitigation actions focus predominantly on reducing carbon emissions from deforestation alone. However, every year vast areas of the humid tropics are disturbed by selective logging, understory fires, and habitat fragmentation. There is an urgent need to understand the effect of such disturbances on carbon stocks, and how stocks in disturbed forests compare to those found in undisturbed primary forests as well as in regenerating secondary forests. Here, we present the results of the largest field study to date on the impacts of human disturbances on above and belowground carbon stocks in tropical forests. Live vegetation, the largest carbon pool, was extremely sensitive to disturbance: forests that experienced both selective logging and understory fires stored, on average, 40% less aboveground carbon than undisturbed forests and were structurally similar to secondary forests. Edge effects also played an important role in explaining variability in aboveground carbon stocks of disturbed forests. Results indicate a potential rapid recovery of the dead wood and litter carbon pools, while soil stocks (0-30 cm) appeared to be resistant to the effects of logging and fire. Carbon loss and subsequent emissions due to human disturbances remain largely unaccounted for in greenhouse gas inventories, but by comparing our estimates of depleted carbon stocks in disturbed forests with Brazilian government assessments of the total forest area annually disturbed in the Amazon, we show that these emissions could represent up to 40% of the carbon loss from deforestation in the region. We conclude that conservation programs aiming to ensure the long-term permanence of forest carbon stocks, such as REDD+, will remain limited in their success unless they effectively avoid degradation as well as deforestation. © 2014 The Authors.","Amazon; Biomass; Forest degradation; Logging; REDD+; Secondary forests; Soil; Vegetation; Wildfires","Berenguer, E.; Lancaster Environment Centre, United Kingdom",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912019390

The responses of herbivorous insect communities to habitat changes are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the resilience of galling insect communities associated with Neoboutonia macrocalyx (Euphorbiaceae) trees to logging in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Resilience was measured by comparing the species density, abundance and community structure of gallers in nine differently aged successional forests with those in adjacent primary forests. Insect galls were sampled from the canopy of 10 randomly selected trees in each successional stage, five times in a 10-month period. A total of 7219 individuals representing five galler species were recorded. No significant differences were found in the species density and overall density of gallers between the regenerating and primary forests. The mean tree height was positively correlated with the overall density of gallers. The community structure of gallers differed significantly among the successional stages, but exhibited no clear directional recovery trend. In addition, remarkable seasonal variations were observed in galler communities, with peak abundance being found in the wettest months. The results of the preset study indicate that specialist galling insects whose hosts are pioneer trees can recolonize successional sites rapidly and are resilient to the effects of selective and clear-cut logging in case primary or secondary forests with an established population of Neoboutonia host trees (source populations) are close by. Thus, recovering tropical forests can provide important habitats for galling insect biodiversity, highlighting the need to include them in management and conservation priority plans. © ICIPE 2014.","Afrotropical gallers; deforestation; Kibale National Park; recovery; regeneration; seasonality; secondary forests; succession; Uganda","Malinga, G.M.; Department of Biology, PO Box 111, Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911415245

Understanding the effects of these land use changes on soil fungi, which play vital roles in the soil ecosystem functioning and services, is a major conservation frontier. Using 454-pyrosequencing of the ITS1 region of extracted soil DNA, we compared communities of soil fungi between unlogged, once-logged, and twice-logged rainforest, and areas cleared for oil palm, in Sabah, Malaysia. Overall fungal community composition differed significantly between forest and oil palm plantation. The OTU richness and Chao 1 were higher in forest, compared to oil palm plantation. As a proportion of total reads, Basidiomycota were more abundant in forest soil, compared to oil palm plantation soil. The turnover of fungal OTUs across space, true b-diversity, was also higher in forest than oil palm plantation. Ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungal abundance was significantly different between land uses, with highest relative abundance (out of total fungal reads) observed in unlogged forest soil, lower abundance in logged forest, and lowest in oil palm. In their entirety, these results indicate a pervasive effect of conversion to oil palm on fungal community structure. Such wholesale changes in fungal communities might impact the long-term sustainability of oil palm agriculture. Logging also has more subtle long term effects, on relative abundance of EcM fungi, which might affect tree recruitment and nutrient cycling.

Relative humidity also showed marked seasonality but only at the highest elevations, dropping markedly above 2400 m and especially above 2600 m in the dry season, while remaining high at lower elevations throughout the year. PPT declined only slightly with elevation on windward slopes, but was markedly lower in leeward areas. Dry season PPT was lower on windward and leeward slopes at all elevations, except at ∼2400 m on windward slopes where it remained nearly as high as the rest of the year. Sub-zero temperatures occurred at elevations ≥2325 m and increased markedly in frequency ≥2600 m. These observations support the hypothesis that the discrete vegetation ecotone between the cloud forest and subalpine pine forest at ∼2200 m on windward slopes results from climatic discontinuities, especially during the dry season. In particular, the TWI effect on mesoclimatic patterns (especially moisture) regulates the elevational maximum of cloud forest flora and likely will represent a strong barrier to the future migration of cloud forest flora to higher elevations in response to warmer temperatures. Together with increased moisture stress due to higher temperatures, climate change in the high elevations of tropical mountains is therefore likely to disrupt the dynamics and distributions of tropical montane forests. © 2014 Regents of the University of Colorado.",,"Martin, P.H.; Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, 1173 Campus Delivery, United States",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84913532797

The necessity of an increasing sustainable usage of the forest resources demanded the development of a polycyclic silvicultural system (PSS) adapted to the dense forests commonly found in the Brazilian Amazon. This PSS is now applied in most of the management plans implemented in the Brazilian Amazon. In this system, harvestings operations are carried out through the environmental-friendly techniques of reduced-impact logging (RIL). Nevertheless, the managed forests in the Brazilian Amazon, as well as in several other tropical forests, are not regenerating the harvested commercial species for future cutting cycles. This means that, yields expected for future cutting cycles will not be the same as those currently observed in the first cycle. The problem of insufficient natural regeneration that undermines sustainable future cutting cycles can be solved through silviculture intensification with the application of post-harvesting silvicultural treatments. These treatments consist in using enrichment planting and tending in logging gaps over seedlings and saplings as well. The authors then, present the concepts of assisted densification and organized disturbance and their potential application to ensure the regeneration of commercial species. Consequently, this can improve future harvestings as well as the conservation of rare and threatened species in the Amazon and in the other tropical forests worldwide. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The objective of this study was to build equations capable of estimating the stem volume of dominant and codominant individual trees from the crown’s morphometry obtained by airborne LIDAR, considering two forest inventory situations: a) with the collection of diameter at breast height (DBH), and crown morphometric variables obtained from LIDAR data and b) using only the crown morphometry variables. For the selection of models the factors considered were: the correlation matrix of predictor variables and the combination of variables that generates the best results by statistical criteria Syx, Syx (%) and Pressp, and that were homoscedastic and had a normal and independent distribution of errors. The influence analysis was performed for the best equations. The results for the statistical fit of the equations to the two situations allowed the selection of models with and without DBH, with R2aj.(%) values of a) 92.92 and b) 79.44, Syx(%) values of a) 16.73 and b) 27.47, and, Pressp criterion values of a) 201.15 m6 and b) 537.47 m6, respectively.

Here, we review and synthesize our understanding of Anthropocene changes in tropical forests. Key facets include deforestation driven by agricultural expansion, timber and wood extraction, the loss of fauna that maintain critical ecological connections, the spread of fire, landscape fragmentation, the spread of second-growth forests, new species invasion and pathogen spread, increasing CO2, and climate change. The patterns of change are spatially heterogeneous, are often characterized by strong interactions among different drivers, can have both large-scale and remote effects, and can play out through ecological cascades over long timescales. As a consequence, most tropical forests are on a trajectory to becoming altered ecosystems, with the degree of alteration dependent on the intensity and duration of the current bottleneck of human-induced pressures. We highlight the importance of this understanding to develop the strategies necessary for shaping the transition of tropical forests through the early Anthropocene, as well as highlight the opportunities and challenges for the tropical forest science community in the coming decades.

It can be considered as the spatial manifestation of deforestation and degradation in a landscape. Forest fragmentation thus results in the same loss of ecosystem services as these other forms of land-cover change, but how does it affect livelihoods? We propose here an analysis of the livelihood impacts of tropical forest fragmentation, which will begin with a better definition of the spatial processes involved in fragmentation. As it is difficult to analyse the impacts of fragmentation without consideration of the associated impacts of the causes - or drivers - of forest fragmentation, we will analyse them in detail. Fragmentation results from a range of drivers that are categorized into five groups: (i) economic factors; (ii) governance factors; (iii) demographic factors; (iv) technological factors; and (v) cultural factors. Economic factors are prevalent in decisions, with forest conservation often being a luxury for wealthy people. Stakeholders who gain direct economic returns from deforestation - from logging, farming and facilitated access to markets - will also benefit globally from forest fragmentation, the benefits from these drivers by far outweighing the loss of ecosystem services. However, forest dwellers and isolated forest communities will often have to choose between 'modern' life or the cultural specificities that shaped their identity.

This chapter examines the underlying governance drivers of forest fragmentation through five key analytical approaches: (i) understanding of historically contested property rights over forests involving states, private-sector actors and communities; (ii) the widespread failure of selective logging timber concessions to achieve sustainability objectives in the tropics; (iii) related problems with weak law enforcement, corruption and patronage politics, and the dominance of commercial forestry by political and military elites; (iv) the conversion of forested areas to other land uses, often in response to market and governance failures; and (v) the globalization of resource commodity networks. Significantly, in considering how extra-sectoral land-use conversion influences forest management, we have found that forest fragmentation is often an intentional, yet typically understated, objective of government spatial planning processes. In some cases, forest fragmentation is even implicit in the approach of certain conservation mechanisms such as the designation of 'high-conservationvalue forests'. Forest fragmentation can also be understood not only in biophysical terms but as a socio-cultural phenomenon with profound implications for displaced indigenous groups and other communities living in and around forests. Continued forest fragmentation poses significant challenges for conservation, for the socio-cultural viability of forest-dependent communities and for market-based global forest governance initiatives such as REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation). © CAB International 2014.

Over the past decade, we have collected and digitized over 1000 Costa Rican natural forest management plans, spanning 30years and spread out over approximately 26,700km2 along the country's Atlantic coast, northern lowlands, and southern Pacific coast. In order to analyze this unique collection of tree inventory data we developed a system to ensure the standardization, quality control, and reliable management of the dataset. We developed a relational geodatabase, forming logical associations between and within the spatial and tabular components of the forest management data. In this study, we outline the data standardization procedures established to permit the comparison of data across time and space. Further, we describe quality checks built-into the database's functionality to identify and reduce the presence of errors. The final customized forest management geodatabase efficiently stores a large and diverse dataset through the integration of logical relations, quality checks, and flexible data access across 32 tables and over 250,000 tree records. Through the use of quality tests, the database provides a means to improve overall data integrity and illustrates the magnitude, sources, and types of errors present in the initial dataset. Finally, the value of a comprehensive database for the management of forest data is demonstrated through an exploratory analysis of standardized tree taxonomic information. With this analysis, we begin to explore the potential strengths, weaknesses, and applications of forest management data for future ecological studies (e.g. species diversity assessment). For instance, although most of the forest management data (tree inventories and censuses) is collected using common names in the field, our standardization process has allowed us to depict trends similar to those found in ecological studies (e.g. dominant species for different ecosystems).

Yet, the impacts of logging on biodiversity remain poorly understood, in part due to the seemingly conflicting findings of case studies: about as many studies have reported increases in biodiversity after selective logging as have reported decreases [2, 6-11]. Consequently, meta-analytical studies that treat selective logging as a uniform land use tend to conclude that logging has negligible effects on biodiversity [2, 6, 12]. However, selectively logged forests might not all be the same [2, 13-15]. Through a pantropical meta-analysis and using an information-theoretic approach, we compared and tested alternative hypotheses for key predictors of the richness of tropical forest fauna in logged forest. We found that the species richness of invertebrates, amphibians, and mammals decreases as logging intensity increases and that this effect varies with taxonomic group and continental location. In particular, mammals and amphibians would suffer a halving of species richness at logging intensities of 38 m 3 ha-1 and 63 m3 ha-1, respectively. Birds exhibit an opposing trend as their total species richness increases with logging intensity. An analysis of forest bird species, however, suggests that this pattern is largely due to an influx of habitat generalists into heavily logged areas while forest specialist species decline. Our study provides a quantitative analysis of the nuanced responses of species along a gradient of logging intensity, which could help inform evidence-based sustainable logging practices from the perspective of biodiversity conservation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Burivalova, Z.; Department of Environmental Systems Science, ETH Zürich, CHN G 73.1, Universitätstrasse 16, 8092 Zürich, Switzerland; email: zuzana.burivalova@env.ethz.ch",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906306923

Selective logging is one of the main causes of tropical forest degradation, and its ecological impacts often result from the construction of road networks such as skid trails, logging roads and log yards. However, the effects of such narrow road clearings on forest-dependent species and associated ecological functions have rarely been studied. The present study therefore aimed to assess the impacts of such clearings on dung burial and secondary seed dispersal by dung beetles. The abundance of all functional guilds and the total biomass of dung beetles were drastically low at road clearings, but guild composition was only significantly different between the forest interior and log yards. Dung burial rates decreased with canopy openness, where 40% of dung remained unburied at logging roads and log yards. However, beads (seed mimics) in the dung piles were buried deeper and more frequently in log yards than the forest interior. In contrast, horizontal seed-removal distance was longer in the forest interior than at all road clearing sites. Reduced dung burial rates, and deeper but shorter, seed removal in clearings implies a negative effect of road clearings on the efficiency of secondary seed dispersal and other ecological functions of dung beetles. The imposition of limits on the number and size of logging road networks would be effective for retaining the ecological functions performed by the diverse forest-dependent species after logging. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Decomposition; Dung burial; Secondary seed dispersal; Selective logging; Tropical forest biodiversity","Hosaka, T.; Department of Tourism Sciences, Graduate School of Urban Environmental Sciences, Tokyo Metropolitan University, 1-1 Minamiosawa, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0397, Japan; email: tetsurau@yahoo.co.jp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899733618

We highlight UMI tropical countries because they contain nearly four-fifths of tropical primary forests, which are rich in biodiversity and stored carbon. The first approach is a set of statistical analyses of various cross-country conservation indicators, which suggests that protective government policies have lagged behind the increase in public demand in these countries. The second approach is a case study from Malaysia, which reveals in a more integrated fashion the linkages from rising household income to increased household willingness to pay for conservation, nongovernmental organization activity, and delayed government action. Our findings suggest that domestic funding in UMI tropical countries can play a larger role in (i) closing the funding gap for tropical forest conservation, and (ii) paying for supplementary conservation actions linked to international payments for reduced greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in tropical countries.","Choice experiment; Protected area; REDD; Valuation","Vincent, J.R.; Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, United States; email: Jeff.Vincent@duke.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904279433

The DOM composition was compared to vegetation and peat to assess DOM origin and transformations in the ecosystem. Significant relationships were observed between optical properties (SUVA280, FI) and bulk (δ14C) and molecular (ratio of cinnamyl to vanillyl phenols, C/V) composition of DOM.The radiocarbon content of DOM shows that it is modern at both sites for both surface and deep (to 4.5m) samples (δ14C=74.58±8.53‰ at the pristine site and δ14C=87.84±4.5‰ at the deforested site for the first 2 meters), indicating transport of young DOM to deeper layers. Stable carbon-13 content of vegetation, peat and DOM showed only slight fractionation and ranged from -32.2‰ to -28.3‰. Nitrogen showed a greater shift between ecosystem pools. Nitrogen-15 content was higher in the solid peat (δ15N=-0.92±0.49‰ in the pristine site, δ15N=-1.22±1.37‰ in the deforested site) than in DOM (δ15N=-4.2±2.5‰ in the pristine site, δ15N=-4.1±2.3‰ in the deforested site). This difference in δ15N is significantly correlated with the C/N values of peat and DOM and attributable to higher microbial degradation in the peat compared to DOM. Porewater DOM contains less lignin (λ8=1.10±0.27mg100mgdw-1 in the pristine site and λ8=1.38±0.46mg100mgdw-1 in the deforested site) than does the solid peat (λ8=5.66±2.14mg100mgdw-1 in the pristine site and λ8=10.29±4.69mg100mgdw-1 in the deforested site).

This shows that lignin can be processed rapidly in the porewater of upper layers of tropical peatlands.Logging activity affected the composition of organic matter at the deforested site. Higher lignin content (λ8) was observed in the solid peat, and the composition of DOM differed greatly in the deforested site: δ14C, FI, 3,5Bd/V, (Ad/Al)V are significantly different from the pristine site. Thus it appears that the composition of DOM is more sensitive than the solid phase to the effects of land use change on organic matter dynamic in tropical peatlands. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Gandois, L.; Université de Toulouse: UPS, INP, EcoLab (Laboratoire Ecologie fonctionnelle et Environnement), ENSAT, Avenue de l'AgrobiopÔle, F-31326 Castanet-Tolosan, France; email: laure.gandois@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900441925

The REDD+ mechanism could promote less intensive logging if revenue from the additional carbon stored in the forest compensates financially for the reduced timber yield. Results: Carbon stocks, and timber yields, and their associated values, were predicted at the scale of a forest concession in Gabon over a project scenario of 40 yr with reduced logging intensity. Considering that the timber contribution margin (i.e. the selling price of timber minus its production costs) varies between 10 and US$40 m -3, the minimum price of carbon that enables carbon revenues to compensate forgone timber benefits ranges between US$4.4 and US$25.9/tCO 2 depending on the management scenario implemented. Conclusions: Where multiple suppliers of emission reductions compete in a REDD+ carbon market, tropical timber companies are likely to change their management practices only if very favourable conditions are met, namely if the timber contribution margin remains low enough and if alternative management practices and associated incentives are appropriately chosen. © 2014 Ndjondo et al.","Break-even price; Carbon credit; Diameter cutting limit; Felling cycle; Forest degradation; Forest dynamics; Forest management; REDD+; Tropical forest","Picard, N.; Institut de Recherches en Écologie TropicaleGabon; email: nicolas.picard@cirad.fr",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946576014

In the past decades there was an increase in the number of studies on the effects of logging on biodiversity, but there has been little advancement for bats, despite their ecological importance. We present a review of studies on the effects of logging on bats in tropical forests worldwide carried out in the past three decades. We aimed at answering the following questions: What is known about the effects of logging on the bat fauna of tropical forests? What are the gaps of knowledge that can be filled? We conducted a literature search of studies on the effect of logging on the bat fauna in tropical forests in the past decades. We surveyed the databases Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus with different keyword combinations: ""Bats OR Chiroptera"", ""Logging"", ""Selective logging"", ""Timber extraction"", ""Tropic"", ""Forest"", and ""Tropical Forest"". We found 22 studies focused on Latin America and Southeast Asia. Most studies (81.8%) only compared bat richness and abundance between logged and unlogged areas, where frugivorous bats responded positively to logging, whereas gleaning animalivores bats responded negatively. Few studies (18%) tried to understand how environmental variables, such as changes in vegetation structure, affect bat diversity. We emphasize that future studies aimed at checking the effects of logging on bats should use more than one sampling method in order to obtain more representative samples. Planning should be done with more caution, in order to avoid pseudoreplication and obtain more solid results. Poorly studied regions that have intensive logging, such as the Amazon and the tropical forests of Africa, should receive more attention. © 2014 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação.","Biodiversity; Chiroptera; Sampling design; Selective logging; Timber extraction","Castro, I.J.; Universidade Federal do Amapá, Rodovia Juscelino Kubitschek, km 02, Brazil; email: isai.j.castro@gmail.com",Short Survey,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924239978

Information concerning their nesting requirements is required in order to design specific restoration and conservation actions. To assess this, we studied their nesting ecology in the Central Pacific, Michoacan, Mexico during a ten year period. The analyzed variables ranged from local scale nest site characteristics such as nesting tree species, dimensions, geographic positions, diet and nesting forest patches structure, to large scale features such as vegetation use and climatic variables associated to the nesting tree distributions by an ecological niche model using Maxent. We also evaluated the parrot tolerance to land management regimes, and compared the Pacific nest trees with 18 nest trees recorded in an intensively managed private ranch in Tamaulipas, Gulf of Mexico. Parrots nested in tall trees with canopy level cavities in 92 nest-trees recorded from 11 tree species. The 72.8% of nesting occurred in trees of Astronium graveolens, and Enterolobium cyclocarpum which qualified as keystone trees. The forests where the parrots nested, presented a maximum of 54 tree species, 50% of which were identified as food source; besides, these areas also had a high abundance of trees used as food supply. The lowest number of tree species and trees to forage occurred in an active cattle ranch, whereas the highest species richness was observed in areas with natural recovery. The nesting cavity entrance height from above ground of the Pacific nesting trees resulted higher than those found in the Gulf of Mexico. We hypothesize that the differences may be attributed to Parrot behavioral differences adapting to differential poaching pressure and cavity availability. Nesting trees were found in six vegetation types; however the parrots preferred conserved and riparian semi-deciduous forest for nesting, with fewer nests in deciduous forest, while nesting in transformed agricultural fields was avoided. The main climatic variables associated with the potential distribution of nests were: mean temperature of wettest quarter, mean diurnal temperature range, and precipitation of wettest month. Suitable climatic conditions for the potential presence of nesting trees were present in 61% of the region; however, most of the area consisted of tropical deciduous forests (55.8%), while semi-deciduous tropical forests covered only 17% of the region. These results indicated the importance to conserve semi-deciduous forests as breeding habitats for the Yellow-headed Parrot, and revealed the urgent need to implement conservation and restoration actions. These should include a total ban of land use change in tropical semi-deciduous forest areas, and for selective logging of all keystone tree species; besides, we recommend the establishment of wildlife sanctuaries in important nesting areas, and a series of tropical forest restoration programs in the Central Pacific coast. © 2014, Universidad de Costa Rica.

We developed two cost effective and robust indices for comparing the climate benefits (reduced CO2 emissions) due to RIL. The indices correct for variability in the volume of commercial timber among concessions. We determined that a correction for variability in terrain slope was not needed. We found that concessions certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC, N = 3), when compared with noncertified concessions (N = 6), did not have lower overall CO2 emissions from logging activity (felling, skidding, and hauling). On the other hand, FSC certified concessions did have lower emissions from one type of logging impact (skidding), and we found evidence of a range of improved practices using other field metrics. One explanation of these results may be that FSC criteria and indicators, and associated RIL practices, were not designed to achieve overall emissions reductions. Also, commonly used field metrics are not reliable proxies for overall logging emissions performance. Furthermore, the simple distinction between certified and noncertified concessions does not fully represent the complex history of investments in improved logging practices. To clarify the relationship between RIL and emissions reductions, we propose the more explicit term 'RIL-C' to refer to the subset of RIL practices that can be defined by quantified thresholds and that result in measurable emissions reductions. If tropical forest certification is to be linked with CO2 emissions reductions, certification standards need to explicitly require RIL-C practices. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.","Borneo; Carbon emissions; CO2; Dipterocarpaceae; Reduced-impact logging; Silviculture; Tropical forest","Griscom, B.; The Nature Conservancy, 4245 N Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203, United States; email: bgriscom@tnc.org",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893688223

We conducted field studies in the Porto Dias Agroextractive Settlement Project in Acre, Brazil to assess influences of logging in bamboo-dominated forest sites. Taxonomic composition, stand structure, aboveground biomass, commercial timber volume, and commercial tree seedling and bamboo culm density were compared between five logged vs. unlogged sites in different landholdings, using modified 0.5. ha Gentry plots. No differences in taxonomic composition, aboveground biomass, adult and juvenile stem density, or woody seedling and bamboo culm density were detected between paired logged and unlogged sites. Commercial timber volume, however, was reduced by almost two-thirds in logged plots, suggesting that long-term timber management goals in this forest type are compromised since so few future crop trees remained onsite. Our findings indicate that in order to maximize local management objectives, community forest managers must approach logging in bamboo-dominated forests with caution.

Conservation of the genetic diversity of timber species also enhances the conservation value of production forests and contributes to landscape connectivity. Tropical forests are commonly managed under selection logging regimes with minimum diameter cutting limits. These typically result in systematic removal of the largest and often the most fecund trees. Very little guidance is available to forest managers on the measures needed to maintain viable populations of timber species in production forests. We reviewed current knowledge regarding the impacts of logging on genetic processes in tropical Asian tree species to find foundations for developing practical guidelines for managing these impacts and to identify research needs. The review focuses on mixed dipterocarp forests, where the canopy layer is dominated by trees of the Dipterocarpaceae family, one of the most globally important timber families. We examined the impacts of practices including logging intensity, minimum diameter cutting limits and spatial patterns of tree removal with regards to biological parameters such as effective breeding units, size at reproductive maturity, fine-scale spatial genetic structure and the importance of general flowering in producing diverse seed. Research conducted to date shows that because of characteristics such as naturally low population densities, limited pollen dispersal and fine-scale spatial genetic structure, many tree species in mixed dipterocarp forests are sensitive to reductions in the density of reproductive conspecifics; in most cases tree extraction resulted in increased inbreeding. Although genetic research in these forests is still limited, enough knowledge exists to initiate the development of practical management guidelines e.g. on minimum population densities as a precondition for logging or documentation of sources of propagation material used in enrichment planting. Future research should focus on studying species characteristics which can indicate vulnerability to genetic erosion and the prevalence of these characteristics among species in mixed dipterocarp forests, to identify species or species groups which may require specific measures to maintain genetically viable populations in logged forests and in the larger landscape. Such characteristics may include large size at reproductive maturity or slow increase in fecundity with size, fine-scale spatial genetic structure, low population densities, limited pollen dispersal, or high juvenile mortality. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Dipterocarpaceae; Forest management guidelines; Genetic diversity; Habitat fragmentation; Population size; Selective logging","Jalonen, R.; Bioversity International, PO Box 236, UPM Post Office, Serdang, 43400 Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia; email: r.jalonen@cgiar.org",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892880129

Whilst substantial increases in tree seedlings after logging have been shown, there have been no direct tests of whether this initial enhancement is maintained. We tested if the initial response to logging in a tropical forest in Ghana resulted in increases in seedling recruitment relative to unlogged parts of the same forest and whether subsequent seedling mortality was greater in areas disturbed by logging. We also compared seedling composition, density, species diversity and height 7. y after logging to see if disturbed areas differed from unlogged areas. Timber tree species seedling recruits were assessed after logging in 160 sample plots randomly located on skid trails, felling gaps and in unlogged parts of the same forest. Recruits were named, tagged, mapped, counted and heights measured on five occasions spanning 7. y after logging had ceased. Seedling recruitment was initially enhanced by logging disturbance, principally by Pioneer species, but after 1. y Non-Pioneers dominated the recruits. Mortality of recruits was initially greater in unlogged areas but declined over the 7. y of the study converging on that of disturbed areas to an annualised rate of 0.2. The resultant densities of surviving recruits declined after the initial increase, especially amongst Pioneers. After 7. y, Pioneers were least abundant. Species diversity was initially enhanced by logging disturbance but declined on skid trails after 3. y. In unlogged forest, diversity of recruits increased steadily, and converged on disturbed samples by 7. y. Species composition of recruits initially differed between unlogged and logged samples, but showed convergence after 3. y. The initial effects of disturbance were, however, still detectable at 7. y. The results confirm the initial enhancement of timber tree recruitment after logging disturbance which suffered no greater mortality than unlogged areas. Within 7. y of logging, however, most measures of seedling dynamics were similar in logged and unlogged forest presumably due to canopy closure. Whilst most of the tallest trees at 7. y were Pioneer timber species, Non-Pioneers were numerically dominant. We conclude that appropriately controlled logging does not impair timber tree regeneration. The benefits appear to be securing the establishment and fast growth of Pioneer timber species whose regeneration might be less successful in unlogged forest. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Functional groups; Ghana; Logging disturbance; Mortality; Recruitment; Soil seed bank","Duah-Gyamfi, A.; Forestry Research Institute of Ghana, , Kumasi, Ghana; email: adgyamfi@csir-forig.org.gh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890624661

Uncertainties are quantified and current gaps and weaknesses in knowledge and monitoring systems described in order to guide future requirements. The majority of results agree that Africa is a small sink of carbon on an annual scale, with an average value of -0.61 ± 0.58 Pg C yr-1. Nevertheless, the emissions of CH4 and N2O may turn Africa into a net source of radiative forcing in CO2 equivalent terms. At sub-regional level, there is significant spatial variability in both sources and sinks, due to the diversity of biomes represented and differences in the degree of anthropic impacts. Southern Africa is the main source region; while central Africa, with its evergreen tropical forests, is the main sink. Emissions from land-use change in Africa are significant (around 0.32 ± 0.05 Pg C yr-1), even higher than the fossil fuel emissions: this is a unique feature among all the continents. There could be significant carbon losses from forest land even without deforestation, resulting from the impact of selective logging. Fires play a significant role in the African carbon cycle, with 1.03 ± 0.22 Pg C yr-1 of carbon emissions, and 90% originating in savannas and dry woodlands. A large portion of the wild fire emissions are compensated by CO2 uptake during the growing season, but an uncertain fraction of the emission from wood harvested for domestic use is not. Most of these fluxes have large interannual variability, on the order of ±0.5 Pg C yr-1 in standard deviation, accounting for around 25% of the year-to-year variation in the global carbon budget. <br><br> Despite the high uncertainty, the estimates provided in this paper show the important role that Africa plays in the global carbon cycle, both in terms of absolute contribution, and as a key source of interannual variability. © Author(s) 2014.

A systematic sample of 418 sites (10 km × 10 km size) located at the one-degree geographical confluence points and covered with satellite imagery of 30 m resolution is used for the assessment. Techniques of image segmentation and automated classification are combined with visual satellite image interpretation and quality control, involving forestry experts from Southeast Asian countries. The accuracy of our results is assessed through an independent consistency assessment, performed from a subsample of 1572 mapping units and resulting in an overall agreement of >85% for the general differentiation of forest cover versus non-forest cover. The total forest cover of Southeast Asia is estimated at 268 Mha in 1990, dropping to 236 Mha in 2010, with annual change rates of 1.75 Mha (∼0.67%) and 1.45 Mha (∼0.59%) for the periods 1990-2000 and 2000-2010, respectively. The vast majority of forest cover loss (∼2/3 for 2000-2010) occurred in insular Southeast Asia. Complementing our quantitative results by indicative information on patterns and on processes of forest change, obtained from the screening of satellite imagery and through expert consultation, respectively, confirms the conversion of forest to cash crops plantations (including oil palm) as the main cause of forest loss in Southeast Asia. Logging and the replacement of natural forests by forest plantations are two further important change processes in the region. © 2014 Author(s).",,"Stibig, H.-J.; Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, TP 440, 21027 Ispra (VA), Italy; email: hans-juergen.stibig@jrc.ec.europa.eu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893053535

Particularly, certification of forest products has become a widely adopted practice as a response to a growing international concern over the ecological and economic sustainability of harvesting natural tropical forests because of the benefits on reducing excessive and unnecessary construction of forest roads, reducing excessive use of heavy machinery, diminishing excessive collateral damage, and improving the inefficient milling processes and wasting of residues. To accomplish the aim of this study, which is to compare conventional and certified forestry we used a systems analysis tool that could integrate various benefits of certified forestry including, stand age, wood harvest, soil losses and economic gain or loss. We found that the affected area under uncertified logging practices is twice the area of certified forestry because conventional practices require more roads, more logging decks and more skid trails. Also, the rate of soil erosion between uncertified logging (154 Mg/ha/yr) and certified logging (66 Mg/ha/yr) is different. Based on these data, we estimated that the total emergy removed from certified forests was 40% less than the forest under conventional forestry. The fact that certification does a better job of preserving forest while removing wood was also demonstrated through the Environmental Loading Ratio (ELR). We also found that certification leaves forests with a 30% better chance to recover after logging because less wood is removed. But forestry using certification showed a lower Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR) because the lower yield and the extra cost of certification. Certification is also favored for the higher price for certified wood in international markets. Then, when Bolivia exports uncertified wood, it obtains a positive benefit, but lower than using uncertified wood domestically (EYR = 20.4). In other words the worst thing the country could do is certify wood for their domestic market and sell uncertified wood abroad. © 2014 L and H Scientific Publishing, LLC.","Certified forestry; Emergy; Energy analysis; Sustainability","Izursa, J.-L.; Animal Science/Agricultural Engineering Building, United States; email: jlizursa@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015387635

Thirteen nest trees were located in five tree species, but most nesting pairs used Piranhea mexicana (Picrodendraceae). Three nest trees contained multiple nesting pairs; one tree contained three pairs nesting simultaneously. Nesting trees were located in three vegetation types, but tropical semideciduous forest contained 75% of the nests, yielding a nesting tree density of 2.0/km2 and a nesting pair density of 3.0/km2. We systematically monitored seven nests all within tropical semideciduous forest. All seven monitored nests succeeded and produced an average of 1.28 chicks that reached fledging age. However, we were unable to monitor hatching and fledging success, although no signs of predation were evident in the surroundings. Although the sample size of nests is small, reproductive performance and tree and forest characteristics allowed us to hypothesize that this macaw population is nesting in an area that likely contains the highest quality among all the studied Military Macaw populations in Mexico. It is essential to outline with precision the forest extent containing suitable nesting conditions, as well as the nesting population size. The observed nesting tolerance may facilitate management and conservation actions for the species in the region, offering opportunities to design environmental education initiatives compatibles with ecotourism. Urgent conservation measures include a total prohibition of logging of all large emergent live and decaying trees in the region; ideally, the area should be designated as wildlife sanctuary for habitat protection of endangered species. © 2014 The Neotropical Ornithological Society.","Ara militaris; Military Macaw; Nest density; Nesting; Piranhea mexicana; Psittacidae; Reproductive success; Suitable habitat",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978765240

Due to their spatial distribution and sampling intensity, pre-felling inventories are a potential source of ground level data that could help reduce this uncertainty at larger spatial scales. Further, exploring the factors known to influence tropical forest biomass, such as wood density and large tree density, will improve our knowledge of biomass distribution across tropical regions. Here, we evaluate (1) the variability of wood density and (2) the variability of AGB across five ecosystems of Costa Rica. Results: Using forest management (pre-felling) inventories we found that, of the regions studied, Huetar Norte had the highest mean wood density of trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than or equal to 30 cm, 0.623 ± 0.182 g cm-3 (mean ± standard deviation). Although the greatest wood density was observed in Huetar Norte, the highest mean estimated AGB (EAGB) of trees with a DBH greater than or equal to 30 cm was observed in Osa peninsula (173.47 ± 60.23 Mg ha-1). The density of large trees explained approximately 50% of EAGB variability across the five ecosystems studied. Comparing our study's EAGB to published estimates reveals that, in the regions of Costa Rica where AGB has been previously sampled, our forest management data produced similar values. Conclusions: This study presents the most spatially rich analysis of ground level AGB data in Costa Rica to date. Using forest management data, we found that EAGB within and among five Costa Rican ecosystems is highly variable. Combining commercial logging inventories with ecological plots will provide a more representative ground level dataset for the calibration of the models and remotely sensed data used to EAGB at regional and national scales. Additionally, because the non-protected areas of the tropics offer the greatest opportunity to reduce rates of deforestation and forest degradation, logging inventories offer a promising source of data to support mechanisms such as the United Nations REDD + (Reducing Emissions from Tropical Deforestation and Degradation) program. © 2014 Svob et al.; licensee Springer.","Aboveground biomass; Costa Rica; Forest management; Tropical forest; Wood density","Arroyo-Mora, J.P.; Department of Geography, Burnside Hall Building, Canada; email: pablo.arroyo@mcgill.ca",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969508888

This process is of global concern, as it is considered to be one of the main drivers of climate change. Radar remote sensing is been found very valuable for monitoring forest cover since the presence of clouds often limits continuous and periodic monitoring by optical sensors. This chapter presents the outcome of a research that was conducted in Youbi, Congo-Brazzaville. The overall objective of this research was to assess the potential of very high (1 m - 3 m) and medium (8 m - 30 m) resolution synthetic aperture radar imagery for identifying forest degradation signs. This was undertaken with a view to contribute to the development of alternative monitoring strategies in support of the Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) framework of the UN-REDD+ initiative. Visual interpretation was the main approach adopted in this research. Logging roads were only visible on 1 m TerraSAR-X SpotLight and 3 m TerraSAR-X StripMap imagery. Both of these data sources and RADARSAT Multi-Look Fine images could detect clearcuts in dense to open canopy forest types. This research concludes that the detection of logging roads by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) requires a spatial resolution below 5 m, while clearcuts are detectable with a less than 10 m resolution SAR image. It was also found that the viewing geometry of the SAR data acquisitions has a strong effect on the possibility to visually detect forest degradation signs. For monitoring purposes, repeated monitoring using the same satellite sensor and viewing geometry is therefore recommended. Frequent acquisition of TerraSAR StripMap is further recommended (best cost/efficiency data) as a monitoring option for future studies in the framework of REDD+. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Along with several key species, the critically endangered western lowland gorilla (WLG) potentially contributes to forest dynamics through seed dispersal. Considering the extensive influence of timber harvesting on tropical forest ecosystems, the survival of gorilla populations in logged forests might prove critical for forest ecosystem conservation. We estimated WLG density, through a nest count survey, in a forest in southeast Gabon that has been logged for 25 years. Nesting behavior and habitat use were described and we applied generalized linear models to identify the factors that influence gorilla day and night habitat use. The estimated density of weaned gorillas, 1.5 gorillas km-2, is comparable with estimates from some protected areas and other sustainably managed sites within their range. Habitat type had the greatest influence on nest site distribution. We observed a preference for nesting in open terra firma forest, and open habitats in general, which supports the findings of previous studies. Habitat use during the day was strongly influenced by habitat type and human activities, and to a lesser degree by functional and non-functional roads, and rivers. Our results support the suggestion that logged forests are suitable habitats for WLG if hunting and poaching are controlled. We recommend collaborations between timber operators and scientists to improve the conservation potential of tropical forests and enhance the wildlife-management aspects of logging practices. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Gabon; Gorilla gorilla gorilla; Long term impact; Nesting behavior; Standing crop nest count; Timber exploitation","Haurez, B.; Laboratory of Tropical and Subtropical Forestry, Passage des Déportés 2, 5030 Gembloux, Belgium; email: bhaurez@doct.ulg.ac.be",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940243737

Examples of both invasions by aliens into tropical production forests and plantation forests as sources of invasions are presented. We discuss species traits and processes affecting spread and invasion, and silvicultural practices that favor invasions. We also highlight potential impacts of invasive plant species and discuss options for managing them in production forests. We suggest that future forestry practices need to reduce the risks of plant invasions by conducting surveillance for invasive species; minimizing canopy opening during harvesting; encouraging rapid canopy closure in plantations; minimizing the width of access roads; and ensuring that vehicles and other equipment are not transporting seeds of invasive species. Potential invasive species should not be planted within dispersal range of production forests.

Mapping and monitoring this variation is essential if policy developments such as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) are to be known to have succeeded or failed. Results: We produce a map of carbon storage across the watershed of the Tanzanian Eastern Arc Mountains (33.9 million ha) using 1,611 forest inventory plots, and correlations with associated climate, soil and disturbance data. As expected, tropical forest stores more carbon per hectare (182 Mg C ha-1) than woody savanna (51 Mg C ha-1). However, woody savanna is the largest aggregate carbon store, with 0.49 Pg C over 9.6 million ha. We estimate the whole landscape stores 1.3 Pg C, significantly higher than most previous estimates for the region. The 95% Confidence Interval for this method (0.9 to 3.2 Pg C) is larger than simpler look-up table methods (1.5 to 1.6 Pg C), suggesting simpler methods may underestimate uncertainty. Using a small number of inventory plots with two censuses (n = 43) to assess changes in carbon storage, and applying the same mapping procedures, we found that carbon storage in the tree-dominated ecosystems has decreased, though not significantly, at a mean rate of 1.47 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (c. 2% of the stocks of carbon per year). Conclusions: The most influential variables on carbon storage in the region are anthropogenic, particularly historical logging, as noted by the largest coefficient of explanatory variable on the response variable. Of the non-anthropogenic factors, a negative correlation with air temperature and a positive correlation with water availability dominate, having smaller p-values than historical logging but also smaller influence. High carbon storage is typically found far from the commercial capital, in locations with a low monthly temperature range, without a strong dry season, and in areas that have not suffered from historical logging. The results imply that policy interventions could retain carbon stored in vegetation and likely successfully slow or reverse carbon emissions. © 2014 Willcock et al.","Degradation; Disturbance; Eastern Arc Mountains; Ecosystem service; Forest; IPCC Tier 3; REDD+; Tanzania","Willcock, S.; School of Geography, United Kingdom; email: S.P.Willcock@soton.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928546625

Advanced RADAR instruments on board satellites can contribute with novel methods. RADARs can see through clouds, and furthermore, by applying stereo RADAR imaging we can measure forest height and its changes. Such height changes are related to carbon stock changes in the biomass. We here apply data from the current Tandem-X satellite mission, where two RADAR equipped satellites go in close formation providing stereo imaging. We combine that with similar data acquired with one of the space shuttles in the year 2000, i.e. the socalled SRTM mission. We derive height information from a RADAR image pair using a method called interferometry. Results: We demonstrate an approach for REDD based on interferometry data from a boreal forest in Norway. We fitted a model to the data where above-ground biomass in the forest increases with 15 t/ha for every m increase of the height of the RADAR echo. When the RADAR echo is at the ground the estimated biomass is zero, and when it is 20 m above the ground the estimated above-ground biomass is 300 t/ha. Using this model we obtained fairly accurate estimates of biomass changes from 2000 to 2011. For 200 m2 plots we obtained an accuracy of 65 t/ha, which corresponds to 50% of the mean above-ground biomass value. We also demonstrate that this method can be applied without having accurate terrain heights and without having former in-situ biomass data, both of which are generally lacking in tropical countries. The gain in accuracy was marginal when we included such data in the estimation. Finally, we demonstrate that logging and other biomass changes can be accurately mapped. A biomass change map based on interferometry corresponded well to a very accurate map derived from repeated scanning with airborne laser. Conclusions: Satellite based, stereo imaging with advanced RADAR instruments appears to be a promising method for REDD. Interferometric processing of the RADAR data provides maps of forest height changes from which we can estimate temporal changes in biomass and carbon. © 2014 Solberg et al.; licensee Springer.","Biomass; Carbon; Forest monitoring; InSAR","Solberg, S.; Norwegian Forest and Landscape Institute, P.O.

Specifically, we investigated change in area impacted by selective logging, change in tall canopy (30m+) area, change in lidar canopy structure metrics, and change in above ground biomass (AGB) using a model-based statistical framework. Ground plot measurements were only available from the time of the 2010 lidar acquisition. A simple differencing of the 2010 and 2011 lidar canopy height models identified areas where canopy over 30m tall had been removed. Area of tall canopy dropped from 22.8% in 2010 to 18.7% in 2011, a reduction of 4.1%. Using a relative density model (RDM) technique the increase in area of roads, skidtrails, landings, and felled tree gaps was estimated to be 17.1%.A lidar-based regression model for estimating AGB was developed using lidar metrics from the 2010 lidar acquisition and corresponding AGB ground plot measurements. The estimator was then used to compute AGB estimates for the site in 2010 and 2011 using the 2010 and 2011 lidar acquisition data, respectively. A model-based statistical approach was then used to estimate the uncertainty of the changes in AGB between the acquisitions. Change in RDMs between lidar acquisitions was used to classify each 50m cell in the study area as impacted or non-impacted by logging. The change in mean AGB for the entire study area was -9.1Mgha-1±1.9 (mean±SD) (P-value&lt;0.0001).

Natural forest management refers to the selective logging practices for the production of timber in natural forest ecosystems. The study considers natural forest management plans developed following a standardized format, based on Forestry Law 7575, established in 1996. Our results show a positive aspect of forest management where a large percentage of the managed forest is still standing, contrary to other tropical countries where selective logging promotes land use change. The negative finding is that managed forest areas occur in the last remaining forest fragments outside of protected areas, which challenges the continuity of selective logging in the near and mid future due to the potential impoverishment of the isolated forest stands. The most negative aspect is the recent establishment, by law, of a very short return logging cycle (10-15 years-minimum cutting cycle) as it contradicts ecological studies showing that tropical forests require over 60 years for the forest structure and composition to return to a state similar to pre-logging states.

This will require strong law enforcement to succeed. Yet, strategies that have accomplished this are rare and, along with past failures, tend not to be documented. We evaluated a multistakeholder approach that seeks to tackle illegal logging in the carbon-rich province of Aceh, Sumatra. From 2008 to 2009, Fauna & Flora International established and supported a community-based informant network for the 738,000 ha Ulu Masen ecosystem. The network reported 190 forest offenses to local law enforcement agencies, which responded with 86 field operations that confiscated illicit vehicles, equipment, and timber, and arrested 138 illegal logging suspects. From 45 cases subsequently monitored, 64.4% proceeded to court, from which 90.0% of defendants received a prison sentence or a verbal warning for a first offense. Spatial analyses of illegal logging and timber storage incidents predicted that illegal activities would be more effectively deterred by law enforcement operations that targeted the storage sites. Although numerous clusters of incidents were identified, they were still widespread reflecting the ubiquity of illegal activities. The multistakeholder results were promising, but illegal logging still persisted at apparently similar levels at the project's end, indicating that efforts need to be further strengthened. Nevertheless, several actions contributed to the law enforcement achievements: strong political will; strong stakeholder support; and funding that could be promptly accessed. These factors are highlighted as prerequisites for achieving Indonesia's ambitious REDD+ goals. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.","Aceh; Climate change; Law enforcement; Sumatra; Tropical deforestation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904742056

An observational study to determine the different factors affecting male and female decisions to change land use at the individual level in a forest margin landscape in Jambi (Sumatra, Indonesia) was combined with a set of role playing games (RPGs) designed to assess participant responses in a simulated social setting of women-only and men-only groups. The RPG included simulated agents offering new opportunities to convert or conserve agroforest. In the study area, rubber (Hevea braziliensis) agroforests that support high biodiversity and carbon storage are giving way to monoculture rubber and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations. When women from both the upland and lowland villages played the RPGs, external investors proposing logging or oil palm conversion were approached very positively and the resulting land use change was more dynamic and extensive than in the equivalent men-only groups. Consequently, women outperformed men in achieving income targets. In lowland areas gender is strongly associated with land use change, while in the uplands the level of conservation awareness plays a more crucial role in the maintenance of rubber agroforests. Based on the data, and contrary to expectations and gender stereotypes, it is expected that the greater involvement of women in landscape level decision making will increase emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in the area, posing further challenges to efforts to reduce such emissions. © 2013 The Author(s).","Decision making; Emergence; Income differentiation; Matrilineal system; Role-playing games; Rubber agroforests","Villamor, G.

At that point, the seemingly inexorable trends toward increased intensities of exploitation and management will be recognized as having taken their tolls of biodiversity and other forest values. Celebrations when a country passes this 'forest transition' will then be tempered by realization that what has been accepted as 'forest' spans the gamut from short-rotation mono-clonal stands of genetically engineered trees to fully protected old growth natural forest. With management intensification, climate change, species introductions, landscape fragmentation, fire, and shifts in economics and governance, forests will vary along gradients of biodiversity, novelty of composition, stature, permanence, and the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic forces. Management intensity will increase with the increased availability of financial capital associated with economic globalization, scarcity of wood and other forest products, demand for biofuels, improved governance (e.g., security of property rights), improved accessibility, and technological innovations that lead to new markets for forest products. In a few places, the trend toward land-use intensification will be counterbalanced by recognition of the many benefits of natural and semi-natural forests, especially where forest-fate determiners are compensated for revenues foregone from not intensifying management. Land-use practices informed by research designed and conducted by embedded scientists will help minimize the tradeoffs between the financial profits from forest management and the benefits of retention of biodiversity and the full range of environmental services. © 2014 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","Natural forest management; Plantation forestry; Selective logging; Silviculture","Putz, F.E.; Center for International Forestry Research, Jl.

Research suggests that this secondary regrowth is limited by climate and nutrient availability and, using a coupled biosphere-atmosphere model, we investigated patterns in the regrowth of the Amazon rainforest after a full deforestation event, considering different types of nutrient stress. We found that, over a 50 year regrowth period, the reduction of precipitation caused by large-scale deforestation was not sufficient to prevent secondary forest regrowth, but this decrease in precipitation combined with nutrient limitation, due to logging and frequent fires, did indeed prevent forest regrowth in central and southern Amazonia, leading to a savannization. These results are concerning, as the northern Mato Grosso region has the highest clearing rate in Amazonia. The low resilience of the forest under nutrient stress indicates that a large scale disturbance could greatly expand the area suitable for cropland, accelerating forest disappearance.","Amazon; Climate; Deforestation; Ecosystem model; Net primary production; Savannization","Senna, M.

It has been hypothesized that the low frequency of disturbances in monodominated forests and the tolerance to shade of the monodominant species are two important factors explaining the prolonged dominance of a single species. We determined the role of these two factors by examining the effects of logging activities on the floristic composition and seedling dynamics in a Prioria copaifera dominated forest in Southeastern Costa Rica. We determined the floristic composition for trees ≥2.5cm DBH and the associated recruitment, survival and mortality of tree canopy seedlings in two sites logged two (L-02) and 12 years (L-12) prior to sampling and an unlogged forest (ULF). Our results showed that L-02 stands had lower species richness (25 species) than the L-12 and ULF stands (49 and 46 species, respectively). As expected, we found significant logging effects on the canopy structure of the altered forests, particularly when comparing the L-02 and the ULF stands. Seedling density was higher in ULF (0.96 seedlings/ m2) than in the L-02and L-12 stands (0.322 and 0.466 seedlings/m2, respectively). However, seedling mortality was higher in the ULF stands (54%) than in the L-02 (26%) and L-12 (15%) stands. P. macroloba in L-02 was the only species with abundant regeneration under P. copaifera in L-02 stand, where it accounted for 35% of the seedlings. Despite the reduction in seedling abundance observed after logging, P. copaifera seems to maintain large seedling populations in these forests, suggesting that this species maintains its dominance after logging disturbances. Our findings challenge the hypothesis that the regeneration of monodominant species is not likely to occur under heavily disturbed canopy conditions.","Carapa guianensis; Floristic composition; Forest structure; Logging impact; Pentaclethra macroloba; Prioria copaifera; Tree regeneration; Tropical monodominance",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901050691

In this study, we use an individual-based model parameterized using 15 years of annual census data to simulate population dynamics of big-leaf mahogany Swietenia macrophylla King in southeast Amazonia in response to multiple harvests and in the absence of harvesting. The model is based on regression equations of stem diameter growth, mortality, and fruit production estimated as a function of stem diameter and prior growth; it includes functions for germinating seeds, growing trees from seedling to adult senescence, producing seeds, and creating disturbances at specified spatial scales and return intervals, including logging. We simulate six harvest scenarios by varying the minimum diameter cutting limit (60 cm, 80 cm) and the retention rate requirement (20%, 40% and 60% commercial population retained). Without logging, simulated populations grew over 100 years by 182% from observed densities, indicating that one or more parameters in the model may overestimate long-term demographic rates on this landscape. However, 100-year densities did not far exceed values reported from forests across this region, and other modelled demographic parameters resembled observed behaviours. Under current harvest regulations for mahogany in Brazil (60 cm minimum diameter cutting limit, 20% commercial-sized tree retention rate, minimum 5 commercial-sized trees 100 ha-1 retained after harvest, 30-year cutting cycle), commercial densities at the study site would decline from 39·7 to 11·3 trees 100 ha-1 before the fourth harvest in year 90, yielding an estimated 16·4% of the initial harvest volume during the fourth harvest. Increasing retention rates caused first-cut harvest volumes to decline but improved population recovery rates between harvests. Under both minimum diameter cutting limit scenarios, increasing retention rates led to more robust population recovery compared with the current 20% rate, and higher subsequent harvest yields relative to initial (first-cut) values. Synthesis and applications. These results indicate that current harvest regulations in Brazil for mahogany and other high-value timber species with similar life histories will lead to commercial depletion after 2-3 cutting cycles. Increasing commercial-sized tree retention rates improved population recovery at the cost of reduced initial harvest volume yields. Sustainable harvests will require, in combination, a moderate increase in the retention rate, investment in artificial regeneration to boost population recovery, and implementation of silvicultural practices designed to increase growth rates by future crop trees. © 2013 British Ecological Society.","Amazon; Brazil; Growth autocorrelation; Growth modelling; Individual-based model; Sustainable forest management; Tropical timber","Grogan, J.44 Cave Hill Road, Apt 2, Leverett, MA 01054, United States; email: jegrogan@mtholyoke.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900539478

Rapid assessment and monitoring using remote sensing on biodiversity of tropical forests is needed to predict and evaluate biodiversity loss by human activities. Identification of reliable indicators of forest biodiversity and/or its loss is an urgent issue. In the present paper, we propose the density of road networks in tropical forests can be a good and practical indicator of human impacts on biodiversity in tropical forests through reviewing papers and introducing our preliminary survey in peninsular Malaysia. Many previous studies suggest a strong negative impact of forest roads on biodiversity in tropical rainforests since they changes microclimate, soil properties, drainage patterns, canopy openness and forest accessibility. Moreover, our preliminary survey also showed that even a narrow logging road (6 m wide) significantly lowered abundance of dung beetles (well-known bio-indicator in biodiversity survey in tropical forests) near the road. Since these road networks are readily to be detected with remote sensing approach such as aerial photographs and Lider, regulation and monitoring of the road networks using remote sensing techniques is a key to slow down the rate of biodiversity loss due to forest degradation in tropical forests. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Hosaka, T.; Department of Tourism Sciences, Graduate School of Urban Environmental Sciences, Tokyo Metropolitan University, 1-1 Minami-osawa, Hachioji, Tokyo, 1920397, Japan; email: hosaka-t@tmu.ac.jp",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899757662

We empirically evaluate the relationship between investment source and deforestation from 2000 to 2010 in the Republic of Congo. A Congolese forestry code was implemented in 2000 to mitigate degradation of production forests by standardizing all logging in the country according to sustainable forest management(SFM) guidelines. Following the implementation of this law, the majority(73%) of Congo's production forests were managed by European(40%) and Asian(33%) companies. European concessions had the highest rates of total and core deforestation, followed by Asian concessions, indicating that the fragmentation of intact forests in Congo is strongly associated with industrial logging fueled by foreign capital. European concession holders were also far more likely to comply with SFM policies, followed by Asian concessions, suggesting that compliance with Sustainable Forest Management policies may not mitigate degradation in tropical production forests. Further evaluation of the relationship between investment source, regulatory compliance, and outcomes in tropical countries is essential for effective conservation of tropical forest ecosystems. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.","avoided deforestation; conservation success; counterfactual; logging concessions; quasiexperimental matching",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899504928

However, the effects on physicochemical surface-soil properties remain largely unknown, especially in seasonal tropical forest ecosystems. We initiated a litterremoval manipulation experiment in a Cambodian lowland evergreen forest undergoing intensive selective logging. Litter removal performed for 2 and 4.4 years respectively triggered an increase in bulk density and decrease in surface-soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents to 67 and 73% of the original levels, respectively. After only 2 years of treatment, bulk density rose to very high value (&gt;1.40 Mg m-3) likely preventing further soil compaction, while the C and N reduction effects lasted over 2 years. Greater soil compaction occurs in stands with a smaller initial bulk density. However, C (N)-rich soils did not necessarily lose a greater relative proportion of C (N) than C (N)-poor soils. Although N remained above C following the litter removal, conservative trends in the C:N ratio suggested a limited capacity for N retention. Together, our data suggest that shifts in leaf litter inputs in response to localized human disturbances may have rapid and lasting consequences on physicochemical surface-soil properties; possibly accelerated by a tropical climate. Moreover, a speedy recovery to an adequate litter supply, at least before reaching the upper soil compaction limit, is essential to conserve forest ecosystems.","Bulk density; Carbon; Forest degradation; Nitrogen; Soil compaction","Ito, E.; Hokkaido Research Center, , Sapporo, Hokkaido 062-8516, Japan; email: iter@ffpri.affrc.go.jp",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898896158

These changes in land-use are known to affect species diversity but consequences for the functional diversity of species assemblages are poorly understood. Environmental filtering of species with similar traits could lead to disproportionate reductions in trait diversity in degraded habitats. Here, we focus on dung beetles, which play a key role in ecosystem processes such as nutrient recycling and seed dispersal. We use morphological and behavioural traits to calculate a variety of functional diversity measures across a gradient of disturbance from primary forest through intensively logged forest to oil palm. Logging caused significant shifts in community composition but had very little effect on functional diversity, even after a repeated timber harvest. These data provide evidence for functional redundancy of dung beetles within primary forest and emphasize the high value of logged forests as refugia for biodiversity. In contrast, conversion of forest to oil palm greatly reduced taxonomic and functional diversity, with a marked decrease in the abundance of nocturnal foragers, a higher proportion of species with small body sizes and the complete loss of telecoprid species (dung-rollers), all indicating a decrease in the functional capacity of dung beetles within plantations. These changes also highlight the vulnerability of community functioning within logged forests in the event of further environmental degradation. © 2013 The Zoological Society of London.","Borneo; Deforestation; Ecosystem services; Habitat change; Palm oil; Tropical forest","Edwards, F.A.; School of Biology, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, United Kingdom; email: bs08f2a@leeds.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898055660

The second 'D' is poorly understood and accounted for a number of technical and policy reasons. Here we introduce a complete accounting method for estimating emission factors from selective timber harvesting, a substantial form of forest degradation in many tropical developing countries. The method accounts separately for emissions from the extracted log, from incidental damage to the surrounding forest, and from logging infrastructure, and emissions are expressed as units of carbon per cubic meter of timber extracted to allow for simple application to timber harvesting statistics. We applied the method in six tropical countries (Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Guyana, Indonesia, and Republic of Congo), resulting in total emission factors of 0.99-2.33 Mg C m-3. In all cases, emissions were dominated by damage to surrounding vegetation and the infrastructure rather than the logs themselves, and total emissions represented about 3-15% of the biomass carbon stocks of the associated unlogged forests. We then combined the emission factors with country level logging statistics for nine key timber producing countries represented by our study areas to gain an understanding of the order of magnitude of emissions from degradation compared to those recently reported for deforestation in the same countries. For the nine countries included, emissions from logging were on average equivalent to about 12% of those from deforestation. For those nine countries with relatively low emissions from deforestation, emissions from logging were equivalent to half or more of those from deforestation, whereas for those countries with the highest emissions from deforestation, emissions from logging were equivalent to &lt;10% of those from deforestation. Understanding how to account emissions and the magnitude of each emissions source resulting from tropical timber harvesting practices helps identify where there are opportunities to reduce emissions from the second 'D' in REDD. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.","carbon; degradation; REDDC; selective logging; timber",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897565353

As this time series grows, the MODIS archive provides new opportunities for identification and characterization of land cover at regional to global spatial scales and interannual to decadal temporal scales. In particular, the high temporal frequency of MODIS provides a rich basis for monitoring land cover dynamics. At the same time, the relatively coarse spatial resolution of MODIS (250-500 m) presents significant challenges for land cover change studies. In this paper, we present a distance metric-based change detection method for identifying changed pixels at annual time steps using 500 m MODIS time series data. The approach we describe uses distance metrics to measure (1) the similarity between a pixel's annual time series to annual time series for pixels of the same land cover class and (2) the similarity between annual time series from different years at the same pixel. Pre-processing, including gap-filling, smoothing and temporal subsetting of MODIS 500 m Nadir BRDF-adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) time series is essential to the success of our method. We evaluated our approach using three case studies. We first explored the ability of our method to detect change in temperate and boreal forest training sites in North America and Eurasia. We applied our method to map regional forest change in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, and in tropical forests of the Xingu River Basin in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Results from these case studies show that the method successfully identified pixels affected by logging and fire disturbance in temperate and boreal forest sites. Change detection results in the Pacific Northwest compared well with a Landsat-based disturbance map, yielding a producer's accuracy of 85%. Assessment of change detection results for the Xingu River Basin demonstrated that detection accuracy improves as the fraction of deforestation within a MODIS pixel increases, but that relatively small changes in forest cover were still detectable from MODIS. Annually, over 80% of pixels with >20% deforested area were correctly identified and the timing of change showed good agreement with reference data. Errors of commission were largely associated with pixels located at the edges of disturbance events and inadequate characterization of land cover changes unrelated to deforestation in the reference data. Although our case studies focused on forests, this method is not specific to detection of forest cover change and has the potential to be applied to other types of land cover change including urban and agricultural expansion and intensification. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Change detection; Distance metrics; Forest disturbance; MODIS; Time series","Huang, X.; Department of Earth and Environment, 675 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02215, United States; email: xmhuang@bu.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897479350

In particular, the island of Borneo has lost over 56 % of original lowland forest to resource extraction, fires, and illegal logging. Its rainforests contain 16 primate species, which serve as excellent 'umbrella' taxa for conservation initiatives. The genus Presbytis (Colobinae) is well represented across Borneo by four endemic species (P. chrysomelas; P. frontata; P. hosei, and P. rubicunda), but remains relatively understudied. Using ecological niche modelling, I calculated the distributions of the 12 Bornean Presbytis subspecies; evaluated habitat loss between 2000 and 2010, and examined the current land-use policies across remnant distributions. Subspecies experienced a mean 12.7 % (N = 12 sp.) habitat reduction over the 10 year period. 12.5 % of all habitats were allocated for conversion to oil palm and industrial tree plantations, while logging concessions accounted for a mean 26.3 % across distributions. While the current protected area networks encompassed an average 33.4 % of distributions, most PAs are underfunded, degraded and threatened by logging and mining operations. I therefore recommend priority gazetting of unallocated lands to new PAs within the distribution of Presbytis chrysomelas and Presbytis hosei sabana, which have experienced the highest forest loss in the last 10 years (22-50 %) and are critically endangered. Logging concessions appear to be at least as effective in maintaining forest cover as PAs and have the economic advantage for effective management, but may have detrimental effects to monkey populations. I recommend an urgent assessment of the effects of selective logging practices on species' persistence, and further recommend population surveys to quantify the populations of critically endangered and data deficient subspecies. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Borneo; Colobinae; Distributions; Forest loss; Protected areas","Ehlers Smith, D.

Can REDD+ successfully integrate an emphasis on sustainable development benefits (as with Official Development Assistance, ODA) with a focus on delivering emission reductions (as with the Clean Development Mechanism, CDM)? It is argued that there is a real risk that REDD+ will stay too close to ODA and fail to move beyond its 'readiness' phase. Moreover, as with the CDM, there could be an over-emphasis on results in terms of emission reductions, which would only make it attractive for a small set of activities in relatively few countries. In order to balance sustainable development with cost-effective emission reductions, REDD+ needs to involve the private sector in project implementation and financing, its rules for reference levels and crediting arrangements need to be flexible, and forest countries need to proactively direct activities.Policy relevance REDD+ has the potential to deliver funding at an unprecedented scale for forestry and land use activities in developing countries. However, this will only occur if the mechanism can successfully transition from its current readiness phase (which is similar to ODA) to a results-based REDD+phase (which implies similarities with the CDM). A framework for analysing the attractiveness of results-based REDD+ for both forest and funder countries is provided. It is argued that the interests of forest and funder countries coincide when there are activities that score well with respect to financing and co-funding requirements, socio-economic impacts, and governance implications, within the context of each forest country's policy environment and capabilities. An early case study of a results-based REDD+ transaction, the Indonesian logging moratorium, suggests this conceptual framework provides an effective decision support tool to help design future REDD+ policy interventions to avoid the various pitfalls of ODA and the CDM. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); forestry; Official Development Assistance (ODA); sustainable development","Neeff, T.; not available, Metzer Straße 7, 10405 Berlin, Germany; email: till@neeff.com",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891005199

Results suggest that the type of forest, with regard to both timber volume and species composition, greatly affects the potential of a carbon payment to mitigate forest degradation.

First, in forests where timbers of high commercial value represent only a small proportion of total wood volume (and therefore carbon), selective logging may make conservation of the wider landscape more feasible, and cost-effective.

We conducted enrichment planting 20years after logging in a tropical forest in Borneo to evaluate the effects of soil compaction on the growth and mortality of planted dipterocarp seedlings over seven years. We planted the seedlings in sites that had been impacted to varying degrees, including a skid trail and undisturbed areas. We measured soil nutrients, moisture content, bulk density, penetration resistance, and light conditions. Seedling mortality, height, and shoot diameter were also determined 0, 12, 24, and 81months after planting. Elongation rates of tap and lateral roots were measured 24months after planting. We also excavated seedlings 81months after planting, and compared heights, shoot diameters, tap root length, and lateral root length between compacted and undisturbed soils. Bulk density varied in the range of 0.98-1.61gcm-3 and correlated with soil penetration resistance. Surface soil (0-20cm depth) in the compacted area had two to three times more resistance to penetration than did undisturbed soils. Surface soil penetration resistance significantly increased seedling mortality during the early planting period (0-12months), but mortality in the later periods (12-24 and 24-81months) did not relate to the soil penetration resistance.

Penetration resistance did not reduce the seedling growth rate in the periods 0-12 and 12-24months after planting, and higher soil moisture promoted seedling shoot diameter growth in the same time periods. Lateral root elongation did not differ between compacted and undisturbed forest soils 81months after planting, but tap root elongation was inhibited in the compacted area at that time. Our results suggest that soil compaction negatively affect root elongation and initial seedling survival of planted dipterocarp trees even in 20years after logging operation in Bornean tropical rainforest. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Borneo; Enrichment planting; Root elongation; Skid trail; Soil disturbance","Kenzo, T.; Department of Plant Ecology, Matsunosato 1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8687, Japan; email: mona@affrc.go.jp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888136167

This forest ecosystem is neglected due to its low commercial timber volume and fragile forest structure that amplifies the damage caused by logging operations. This study was conducted in a lightly logged bamboo-dominated forest in Brazilian western Amazon, with the objective to evaluate the sustainability of the applied forest management regime in terms of tree density, above-ground dried biomass and tree bole volume stocks recovery rates and species groups. The forest dynamics were monitored over a period of 12. years in 10 permanent sample plots of 1. ha. Two main results of this study are important to the establishment of cycle lengths, logging intensities and silvicultural treatments for tropical forest management in bamboo-dominated forest: the rapid increment of the above-ground biomass (AGB) observed in the area after logging, and the slow growth of commercial and logged species. In addition, although no climate data was collected in this study, the reported 2005 and 2010 atypical climate events strongly affected forest dynamics and productivity. These results indicate that short cutting cycles and light logging intensities, and the rotation of logged species, should produce the appropriate combination in terms of the disturbance frequency and scale to promote sustainable timber production in bamboo-dominated forests. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Above ground biomass; Bamboo dominated forest; Biomass accumulation; Forest succession; Tropical forest dynamics; Tropical forest management","D'Oliveira, M.V.N.; Embrapa Acre, BR 364, km 14, Rio Branco, Acre CEP 69.901-180, Brazil; email: marcus.oliveira@embrapa.br",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888131542

This study aims to identify the impact of RIL on the regeneration of commercial timber species by comparing the regeneration dynamics of logging gaps with naturally occuring canopy gaps. In the concession of Consorcio Forestal Amazonico in the region of Ucayali in the Peruvian Amazon, a total of 210 circular sample plots were established in 35 gaps in unmanaged natural forest and 35 canopy gaps in forest managed according to RIL guidelines. The size of each canopy gap was estimated by establishing a polygon that followed the vertical projection of the edge of the gap. Three circular plots of 100 m2 were established within each canopy gap. The center points of the plots were placed at the stump, mid-trunk and crown of the fallen tree. It appeared that the total abundance of seedlings did not differ significantly between logging gaps and natural canopy gaps. Instead the response to logging varied between species groups. The Clarisia sp. species group had a significant negative response to logging, while Ormosia sp., Aniba sp., Ocotea sp., Qualea sp. and Terminalia sp. were significantly more abundant in gaps of logged-over forest. A direct effect of seed tree retention on seedling abundance could not be detected statistically. Possible reasons for observed differences between untouched and logged forest and consequences of observed patterns for long-term forest development and management were discussed.

Here we studied forest margins heavily used by local farmers in a forest/agriculture mosaic landscape in Ethiopia. We compared forest structure and plant species composition across 41 forest-agriculture ecotones from 200 m out into the agricultural area to 200 m into the forest. There are strong edge effects from the edge and into the forest on canopy cover and number of stumps and apparently these forest-agricultural edges are intensively used by humans. They are penetrated by paths, beehives are found in the trees, timber of various dimensions is harvested and there is sometimes substantial cover of perennial wild (or semi-wild) crops such as coffee and spices. The number of understory epiphytic fern species as well as number of epiphyllous (i.e., growing on leaves) bryophyte species was lower at 20 m than at 75 m from the edge. The number of fern species was higher in newly created edges and thereafter they declined, which indicates an extinction debt. This pattern was not seen for the epiphyllous bryophytes. It is likely that different human management activities are responsible for many of the found edge effects besides wind and sun effects from the edge. Tropical forest margins provide important resources for people in many landscapes. It is important to understand how such use affects the biota of the forests. This study shows that there are substantial edge effects, but that the edge effects do not seem to become worse over time for epiphyllous bryophytes and only slightly so for ferns.","Afromontane forests; BryoDhyte; Ecotone; Edge effects; Epiphyte; Extinction debt; Fern; Microclimate","Hylander, K.; Department of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences, , SE-106 91 Stockholm, Sweden; email: kristoffer.hylander@su.se",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893827744

Knowing how they perceive, react, and adapt to climatic changes and events is helpful in developing strategies to support adaptation to climate change. Mamberamo in Papua, Indonesia, is a sparsely populated watershed of 7.8 million hectares possessing rich tropical forests. Our study compares scientific and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) on climate, and analyzes how local people in Mamberamo perceive and react to climatic variations. We compared meteorological data for the region with local views gathered through focus group discussions and interviews in six villages. We explored the local significance of seasonality, climate variability, and climate change. Mamberamo is subject to strikingly low levels of climatic variation; nonetheless local people highlighted certain problematic climate-related events such as floods and droughts. As our results illustrate, the implications vary markedly among villages. People currently consider climate variation to have little impact on their livelihoods when contrasted with other factors, e.g., logging, mining, infrastructure development, and political decentralization. Nonetheless, increased salinity of water supplies, crop loss due to floods, and reduced hunting success are concerns in specific villages. To gain local engagement, adaptation strategies should initially focus on factors that local people already judge important. Based on our results we demonstrate that TEK, and an assessment of local needs and concerns, provide practical insights for the development and promotion of locally relevant adaptation strategies. These insights offer a foundation for further engagement. © 2013 by the author(s).","Adaptive strategy; Coping mechanism; Deforestation; Ecosystem services; Gender; Seasonality; Traditional ecological knowledge","Boissière, M.; CIFOR, Situ Gede, Bogor Barat 16115, Indonesia; email: m.boissiere@cgiar.org",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891853238

Understanding the effects of these land use changes on soil bacteria, which constitute a large proportion of total biodiversity and perform important ecosystem functions, is a major conservation frontier. Here we studied the effects of logging history and forest conversion to oil palm plantations in Sabah, Borneo, on the soil bacterial community. We used paired-end Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, V3 region, to compare the bacterial communities in primary, once-logged, and twice-logged forest and land converted to oil palm plantations. Bacteria were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 97% similarity level, and OTU richness and local-scale β-diversity showed no difference between the various forest types and oil palm plantations. Focusing on the turnover of bacteria across space, true α-diversity was higher in oil palm plantation soil than in forest soil, whereas community dissimilarity-based metrics of α-diversity were only marginally different between habitats, suggesting that at large scales, oil palm plantation soil could have higher overall γ-diversity than forest soil, driven by a slightly more heterogeneous community across space. Clearance of primary and logged forest for oil palm plantations did, however, significantly impact the composition of soil bacterial communities, reflecting in part the loss of some forest bacteria, whereas primary and logged forests did not differ in composition. Overall, our results suggest that the soil bacteria of tropical forest are to some extent resilient or resistant to logging but that the impacts of forest conversion to oil palm plantations are more severe. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Adams, J.M.; Department of Biological Sciences, , Gwanak-gu, Seoul, South Korea; email: jonadams@snu.ac.kr",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888222567

However, this relationship may have been oversimplified, as many other factors may influence vegetation patterns, such as disturbances, topography and geographic distance. Considering these other factors, our primary question was: is there a vegetation pattern associated with substantial altitudinal variation (10-1,093 m a.s.l.) in the Atlantic Rainforest-a top hotspot for biodiversity conservation-and, if so, what are the main factors driving this pattern? We addressed this question by sampling 11 1-ha plots, applying multivariate methods, correlations and variance partitioning. The Restinga (forest on sandbanks along the coastal plains of Brazil) and a lowland area that was selectively logged 40 years ago were floristically isolated from the other plots. The maximum species richness (>200 spp. per hectare) occurred at approximately 350 m a.s.l. (submontane forest). Gaps, multiple stemmed trees, average elevation and the standard deviation of the slope significantly affected the vegetation pattern. Spatial proximity also influenced the vegetation pattern as a structuring environmental variable or via dispersal constraints.

We used nitrogen stable-isotope analysis of 73 species of understory birds to quantify trophic responses to repeated intensive logging of rainforest in northern Borneo and to test 4 hypotheses: logging has significant effects on trophic positions and trophic-niche widths of species, and the persistence of species in degraded forest is related to their trophic positions and trophic-niche widths in primary forest. Species fed from higher up the food chain and had narrower trophic-niche widths in degraded forest. Species with narrow trophic-niche widths in primary forest were less likely to persist after logging, a result that indicates a higher vulnerability of dietary specialists to local extinction following habitat disturbance. Persistence of species in degraded forest was not related to a species' trophic position. These results indicate changes in trophic organization that were not apparent from changes in species composition and highlight the importance of focusing on trophic flexibility over the prevailing emphasis on membership of static feeding guilds.

This production is expected to be sustainable, but the actual impact of logging on biodiversity is still questioned.To answer this question, we used a unique long-term controlled experiment implemented more than 20. years ago in an old-growth semi-deciduous moist forest of the Central African Republic (CAR). We tested whether (i) anthropogenic disturbances associated with silvicultural operations had an effect on the composition and diversity of tree communities, and (ii) there is a relationship between diversity and disturbance intensity in those forests.For this, we botanically identified all trees. ≥. 10. cm DBH in 28 1-ha plots where no treatment (controls), logging and logging. +. thinning operations were implemented 24. years ago and created a strong gradient of disturbance. We investigated the relationships between five diversity indices and a disturbance index calculated for each 1-ha plot, for all species and separately for three regeneration guilds.We found a strong positive monotonic relationship between the intensity of disturbance and the percentage of pioneer species in the tree communities, which proved to be equally detrimental, in terms of relative abundance, to the non-pioneer light-demanding and the shade-bearing species.Overall, disturbance appeared to have a weak monotonous negative effect on diversity, irrespective to the index considered. The diversity of shade-bearers slightly decreased along the disturbance gradient without significant decrease in species density; disturbance had no effect on non-pioneer light demanders, but a clear significant negative effect on the diversity of pioneers, with a significant decrease in species density. This negative effect was associated with the massive recruitment of the early-successional, fast-growing Musanga cecropioides R. Br. (Urticaceae), which rapidly preempted space and resources in the most disturbed plots. Despite this effect, disturbance did not significantly affect the local heterogeneity in species distribution.These results suggest that the semi-deciduous moist forests of CAR are locally resilient to small-scale disturbances associated with silvicultural operations. This may be a consequence of the past anthropogenic and/or climatic disturbances, which have been stronger and more long-lasting than elsewhere within the tropical forest biome, and would have removed the most vulnerable species.

It remains however controversial whether harvesting a few trees per hectare can be maintained in the long term while preserving other forest services as well. We used a unique 24 year silvicultural experiment, encompassing 10 4 ha plots established in the Central African Republic, to assess the effect of disturbance linked to logging (two to nine trees ha-1 greater than or equal to 80 cm DBH) and thinning (11-41 trees ha-1 greater than or equal to 50 cm DBH) on the structure and dynamics of the forest. Before silvicultural treatments, above-ground biomass (AGB) and timber stock (i.e. the volume of commercial trees greater than or equal to 80 cm DBH) in the plots amounted 374.5+58.2 Mg ha-1 and 79.7+45.9 m3 ha-1, respectively. We found that (i) natural control forest was increasing in AGB (2.58+1.73 Mg dry mass ha-1 yr-1) and decreasing in timber stock (20.33+1.57 m3 ha-1 yr-1); (ii) the AGB recovered very quickly after logging and thinning, at a rate proportional to the disturbance intensity (mean recovery after 24 years: 144%). Compared with controls, the gain almost doubled in the logged plots (4.82+1.22 Mg ha-1 yr-1) and tripled in the logged {thorn} thinned plots (8.03+1.41 Mg ha-1 yr-1); (iii) the timber stock recovered slowly (mean recovery after 24 years: 41%), at a rate of 0.75+0.51 m3 ha-1 yr-1 in the logged plots, and 0.81+0.74 m3 ha-1 yr-1 in the logged {thorn} thinned plots. Although thinning significantly increased the gain in biomass, it had no effect on the gain in timber stock. However, thinning did foster the growth and survival of small- and medium-sized timber trees and should have a positive effect over the next felling cycle. © 2013 The Authors.","Above-ground biomass; Moist semi-deciduous forests; Permanent sample plots; Silviculture; Timber species","Gourlet-fleury, S.; BSEF, , 34398 Montpellier, France; email: sylvie.gourlet-fleury@cirad.fr",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880621172

The forest edges are affected by anthropogenic activities including deforestation, forest fragmentation, selective logging, extraction of non-timber forest products, collection of medicinal plants, recreations, hydroelectric projects and its associated developmental activities, which alter the biodiversity. The present study intends to evaluate the edge effect on vegetation structure and species compositions in the tropical forest ecosystems at Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Ghats. High species richness (number of species) and Shannon's diversity indices were observed in the site III (completely undisturbed forest) compared to site I (adjacent to the village/ edge of the forest, which is next to the teak plantation, severely disturbed forest) and site II (in between the undisturbed forest and moderately disturbed forest) while density of tree species showed greater value in site II. Single species such as Tectona grandis (IVI of 80) and Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 112) were the dominant tree species in site I and site II, respectively, whereas, in site III Terminalia bellirica, Bishofia javanica and Syzgium gardneri shared the dominance. Perturbation leads to alien plant invasion particularly Lantana camara, Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conizoides. Site II is at forest transition level because the site is dominated by both natural species as well as plantation species such as Tectona grandis. This site seems to be a buffer zone on natural forest and plantations.

Land tenure may sometimes have important effects on forest cover, yet such effects remain poorly understood in Amazonia, particularly outside Brazil. In this paper we assess whether significant differences in trends of FCC can be partially explained by different land tenure arrangements, using a case study in southwestern Beni (Bolivian Amazon). We examine spatio-temporal dynamics of FCC across four land tenure systems (indigenous titled territory, protected area, logging concession, and private land) by classifying forests using a time-series of Landsat satellite imagery consisting of four dates (1986, 1996, 2001, 2009). Specifically, we unravel (1) trends in early growth and old-growth forest extent, including changes in total cover area, annual change rates, and spatial change dynamics, and (2) trends in old-growth forest fragmentation. To better understand the association between land tenure and FCC, we qualitatively assess the potential role that other underlying and proximate drivers may have had in FCC over the study period. We found that private lands underwent, by far, the largest FCC, that indigenous territories and the protected area had little FCC, and that logging concessions were responsible for the lowest FCC. Our findings suggest that land tenure played a key role in FCC except in private areas, where many other drivers had operated. Our study sheds light into the potential role of land tenure in FCC and has important implications for public policies aimed at socioeconomic development and environmental conservation in the Amazon. We give some policy recommendations drawn from a biocultural conservation perspective that could contribute to implement more inclusive conservation policies in the region. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Biocultural conservation; Bolivian lowlands; Indigenous territories; Logging concessions; Private lands; Protected areas; Tropical deforestation and forest degradation; Tropical forest fragmentation","Paneque-Gálvez, J.; Centro de Investigaciones en Geografía Ambiental (CIGA), Col.

This is the first study which attempts to estimate AGB and its variability across large areas of tropical lowland forests in Central Kalimantan (Indonesia) through correlating airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to forest inventory data. Two LiDAR height metrics were analysed, and regression models could be improved through the use of LiDAR point densities as input (R2 = 0.88; n = 52). Surveying with a LiDAR point density per square metre of about 4 resulted in the best cost / benefit ratio. We estimated AGB for 600 km of LiDAR tracks and showed that there exists a considerable variability of up to 140% within the same forest type due to varying environmental conditions. Impact from logging operations and the associated AGB losses dating back more than 10 yr could be assessed by LiDAR but not by multispectral satellite imagery. Comparison with a Landsat classification for a 1 million ha study area where AGB values were based on site-specific field inventory data, regional literature estimates, and default values by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) showed an overestimation of 43%, 102%, and 137%, respectively. The results show that AGB overestimation may lead to wrong greenhouse gas (GHG) emission estimates due to deforestation in climate models.

The construction, expansion and improvement of transportation routes in isolated areas can attract newcomers and resource users who engage in illegal logging, poaching, commercial agriculture, as well as planned and spontaneous colonization. These actions can lead to larger-scale surface disturbances that may also affect indigenous territories and natural preserves. However, do these parallel activities and outcomes always accompany E&P development, or can controlled access minimize changes? To answer this question we utilized an ""accounting from above"" approach that uses remote sensing and GIS techniques to analyze surface disturbance patterns linked to infrastructure features for both E&P and parallel activities. Our study area included four neighboring oil blocks in eastern Ecuador's tropical forest, displaying three types of E&P development: public-access, controlled-access and roadless. The first objective was to determine the spatial relationship between infrastructure pattern, disturbance regimes and the type of road access for the year 2000 using land-use land-cover maps, soils data, protected areas and colonization zones. The second objective was to examine the statistical relationships between agricultural conversion and the above factors. Spatial analysis findings suggest that areas of overlap where colonization zones, public-access roads and fertile soils meet are most prone to deforestation. Statistical findings from a linear regression model suggest that the presence of public-access non-oil roads are significant at explaining the conversion of natural vegetation (forest) to agriculture, while the presence of protected areas helps explain the conservation of forested land. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Colonization; Ecuador; Exploration and production (E&P); Land-use land-cover; Oil; Roads","Baynard, C.

Consequently, effective strategies for biodiversity conservation are required, which rely on accurate population density and distribution estimates as a baseline. We sought to establish the first population density estimates of the endemic red langur (Presbytis rubicunda) in Sabangau TPSF, the largest remaining contiguous lowland forest-block on Borneo. Using Distance sampling principles, we conducted line transect surveys in two of Sabangau's three principle habitat sub-classes and calculated group density at 2.52groupskm-2 (95% CI 1.56-4.08) in the mixed-swamp forest sub-class. Based on an average recorded group size of 6.95 individuals, population density was 17.51indkm-2, the second highest density recorded in this species. The accessible area of the tall-interior forest, however, was too disturbed to yield density estimates representative of the entire sub-class, and P. rubicunda was absent from the low-pole forest, likely as a result of the low availability of the species' preferred foods. This absence in 30% of Sabangau's total area indicates the importance of in situ population surveys at the habitat-specific level for accurately informing conservation strategies. We highlight the conservation value of TPSFs for P. rubicunda given the high population density and large areas remaining, and recommend 1) quantifying the response of P. rubicunda to the logging and burning of its habitats; 2) surveying degraded TPSFs for viable populations, and 3) effectively delineating TPSF sub-class boundaries from remote imagery to facilitate population estimates across the wider peat landscape, given the stark contrast in densities found across the habitat sub-classes of Sabangau. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Borneo; Colobinae; Distance sampling; Folivore; Habitat quality","Ehlers Smith, D.A.75, Furnace Lane, Nether Heyford, Northamptonshire NN7 3JS, United Kingdom; email: dehlerssmith@outrop.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879460467

We measured tree-ring width in wood discs taken from ten randomly selected mature individuals. We used previous histological analyses to distinguish and visually crossdate tree rings. Despite the existence of false rings, lenses and wedging rings, the species showed defined annual ring boundaries, thus enabling a tree-ring chronology analysis. Correlations between residual ring-width indices and monthly climatic variables (temperature and rainfall) and atmospheric circulation patterns (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) index were calculated. Growth showed a significant positive correlation with monthly rainfall and a negative correlation with mean temperature during the late rainy season (i.e. from December up to March). A positive correlation found between the ring width and ENSO indices indicates that the growth of M. scleroxylon was significantly affected by atmospheric circulation patterns.

These gaps provide suitable conditions for some opportunistic shrubs and herbs to take advantage of the surge in resources and rapidly colonize disturbed sites. This dense plant cover may limit forest regeneration by interfering with tree seedling establishment, growth, and survival by altering the light and nutrients available to seedlings, modifying herbivore behavior, or a number of other factors. In Kibale National Park (Uganda), old logging sites are mainly covered by dense stands of Acanthus pubescens Engl., which appear to inhibit tree regeneration. We wanted to identify the ecological processes underlying this regeneration collapse. To do so, we designed a factorial experiment to evaluate the influences of herbivory and vegetation cover on the growth and survival of tree seedlings. We compared the survival and growth of transplanted tree seedlings in A. pubescens stands and logged forests, in the presence or absence of the understory vegetation layer (logged forest) or vegetation cover (A. pubescens), and with or without herbivory. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that herbivory is significantly higher under dense A. pubescens cover. Seedling survival was not influenced by the environment. Seedling growth, however, was positively influenced by the removal of A. pubescens, suggesting that changes in resource availability associated with the presence of A. pubescens, may be important for regeneration.

The peat had a high content of lignin, consistent with its origin from the Shorea albida trees on the domes.

How such species use these habitats is an important area of research for guiding their future management. The tropical forest-dwelling sun bear, Helarctos malayanus, is the least known of the eight bear species. Consequently, the IUCN/SSC Bear Specialist Group ranks research on this species as a top priority. This study aims to investigate landscape variables that influence sun bear habitat use in forests under varying levels of degradation and protection. Location: A 20,998 km2 Sumatra forest landscape covering Kerinci Seblat National Park (KSNP), Batang Hari Protection Forest (BHPF) and neighbouring logging and agricultural concessions. Methods: An occupancy-based sampling technique using detection/non-detection data with 10 landscape covariates was applied in six study areas that operated a total of 125 camera traps. The potential differences between habitat use (ψ) of sun bears were first modelled with broad-scale covariates of study area, land-use types and forest type. Sun bear habitat use was then investigated with the finer-scale landscape features associated within these areas. Results: From 10,935 trap nights, sun bears were recorded at altitudes ranging from 365 to 1791 m. At a broad-scale, habitat use increased with protection status, being highest in KSNP (0.688 ± 0.092, ± SE) and BHPF (0.621 ± 0.110) compared to production (0.418 ± 0.121) and convertible (0.286 ± 0.122) forests. Within these areas, sun bears showed a preference for forest that was further from public roads and villages and at a lower elevation. Main conclusions: The habitat suitability model identified several high-quality habitat patches outside of the priority conservation areas for immediate protection. Consequently, conservation management strategies should emphasize the importance of high conservation value forests and prohibit further conversion of threatened lowland forests. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.","Deforestation; Habitat use; High conservation value forests; Land-use planning; Large mammal conservation; Logging; Plantation; Ursidae","Wong, W.-M.; Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, , Kent, CT2 7NR, United Kingdom; email: wai.m.wong1@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879170766

Defaunation is expected to interrupt plant-animal interactions with cascading effects for forest structure, composition, and ecosystem services. In a Central African forest first logged 35years ago, we evaluated this process of ecological erosion in 30 study sites distributed across forest disturbed by logging and hunting, logging alone, and neither logging nor hunting. Both logging and hunting tended to reduce abundances of large mammals, together shifting the relative abundance of the animal community towards squirrels and small birds. Through a series of experiments, we evaluated the effects of logging and hunting on seed dispersal, seed predation and herbivory. We demonstrate that complete defaunation is not necessary to significantly alter the strength of plant-animal interactions. Hunting reduced the mean dispersal distances of nine mammal-dispersed tree species by 22%. Rates of seed predation were similar among forest types, but hunted forest had significantly lower rates of herbivory that we attribute to the lower abundance of meso-herbivores. Hunted forest also had significantly lower above-ground biomass (301Mgha-1) than the logged only (358Mgha-1) and undisturbed (455Mgha-1) forest types, but similar numbers of tree species and individuals. Lower biomass in hunted forest is likely attributable to significantly lower wood densities at small tree size classes (&lt;40cm). We hypothesize that over time the human-mediated modification of plant-animal interactions can alter the composition of the forest to have a higher proportion of fast-growing, low wood density tree species, diminishing the long-term potential for carbon storage. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Above-ground biomass; Central Africa; Defaunation; Herbivory; Seed dispersal; Seed predation","Poulsen, J.R.; Nicholas School of the Environment, P.O.

Forest areas assigned to timber harvesting have sharply expanded over the decades and logging concessions now largely overlap with the range of western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla Savage & Wyman, 1847). However this species, which is considered as critically endangered by IUCN, could play an essential role in maintaining the structure and composition of tropical rainforest notably through seed dispersal services. This is likely due to its frugivorous diet, high stomach capacity and ability to swallow seeds of variable sizes. Moreover gorillas have a long gut retention time of ingested food, travel long daily distances and deposit most ingested seeds in suitable habitats for plant development (such as logging gaps). Consequently, the preservation of the role of gorilla in forest regeneration is essential in the context of logged forest ecosystems. Timber harvesting has two major opposing impacts on gorilla populations: on the one hand, gorillas benefit from growth of herbaceous vegetation (e.g. Marantaceae and Zingiberaceae) following forest canopy opening, as such herbs provide both staple food and nest-building materials; on the other hand, gorilla populations suffer with the rise in hunting associated with logging activity, especially with road network installation. Considering the potential negative knock-on effects of logging concessions on the ecological function of western lowland gorilla, the implementation of timber harvesting methods that preserve gorilla populations is a considerable challenge for forest sustainability, as well as for gorilla's conservation.","Biological interaction; Congo; Ecosystems; Gorilla; Logging; Primates; Tropical forests","Univ.

Our study objective was to evaluate multi-temporal LiDAR measurements of a tropical forested peatland area in Central Kalimantan on Borneo. Canopy height and AGB dynamics were quantified with a special focus on unaffected, selective logged and burned forests. More than 11,000 ha were surveyed with airborne LiDAR in 2007 and 2011. In a first step, the comparability of these datasets was examined and canopy height models were created. Novel AGB regression models were developed on the basis of field inventory measurements and LiDAR derived height histograms for 2007 (r2 = 0.77, n = 79) and 2011 (r2 = 0.81, n = 53), taking the different point densities into account. Changes in peat swamp forests were identified by analyzing multispectral imagery. Unaffected forests accumulated on average 20 t/ha AGB with a canopy height increase of 2.3 m over the four year time period. Selective logged forests experienced an average AGB loss of 55 t/ha within 30 m and 42 t/ha within 50 m of detected logging trails, although the mean canopy height increased by 0.5 m and 1.0 m, respectively. Burned forests lost 92% of the initial biomass.

In the current study, conducted in the Tan Phu ""protection forest"", the investigation surrounds the feasibility of biodiversity restoration in a fast-growing plantation after logging. Twelve threatened and native species mainly belonging to the Dipterocarpaceae and Fabaceae families have been considered. Seedlings grown in a local nursery have been planted under the canopy of a 50 ha pioneer forest, with a distance of 5 m between plants and between rows. The experimental design consists of blocks, each one with a replication of a 16-tree plot for each species. Four years after plantation, the survival rate of seedlings is high (>70 %), except for Dipterocarpus costatus (<10 %). Growth shows possible inhibitions under a closed canopy but the mean annual increment is generally satisfactory. The early performance of the seedlings is promising to make this plantation a good example of biodiversity restoration.

We conducted a large-scale replicated field study in 3 selectively logged moist semideciduous forests in West Africa at varying times after timber extraction to assess post logging effects on amphibian assemblages. Specifically, we assessed whether the diversity, abundance, and assemblage composition of amphibians changed over time for forest-dependent species and those tolerant of forest disturbance. In 2009, we sampled amphibians in 3 forests (total of 48 study plots, each 2 ha) in southwestern Ghana. In each forest, we established plots in undisturbed forest, recently logged forest, and forest logged 10 and 20 years previously. Logging intensity was constant across sites with 3 trees/ha removed. Recently logged forests supported substantially more species than unlogged forests. This was due to an influx of disturbance-tolerant species after logging. Simultaneously Simpson's index decreased, with increased in dominance of a few species. As time since logging increased richness of disturbance-tolerant species decreased until 10 years after logging when their composition was indistinguishable from unlogged forests. Simpson's index increased with time since logging and was indistinguishable from unlogged forest 20 years after logging. Forest specialists decreased after logging and recovered slowly. However, after 20 years amphibian assemblages had returned to a state indistinguishable from that of undisturbed forest in both abundance and composition. These results demonstrate that even with low-intensity logging (≤3 trees/ha) a minimum 20-year rotation of logging is required for effective conservation of amphibian assemblages in moist semideciduous forests. Furthermore, remnant patches of intact forests retained in the landscape and the presence of permanent brooks may aid in the effective recovery of amphibian assemblages. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.","Faunal recovery; Frogs; Ghana; Logged forest; Reduced-impact logging","Adum, G.B.; Department of Wildlife and Range Management, , Kumasi, Ghana; email: adumgilbert@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875545302

Timber production forests can augment the conservation value of primary forest reserves, but studies of logging effects often yield contradictory findings and thus inhibit efforts to develop clear conservation strategies. We hypothesized that much of this variability reflects a common methodological flaw, simple pseudoreplication, that confounds logging effects with preexisting spatial variation. We reviewed recent studies of the effects of logging on biodiversity in tropical forests (n = 77) and found that 68% were definitively pseudoreplicated while only 7% were definitively free of pseudoreplication. The remaining proportion could not be clearly categorized. In addition, we collected compositional data on 7 taxa in 24 primary forest research plots and systematically analyzed subsets of these plots to calculate the probability that a pseudoreplicated comparison would incorrectly identify a treatment effect. Rates of false inference (i.e., the spurious detection of a treatment effect) were >0.5 for 2 taxa, 0.3-0.5 for 2 taxa, and <0.3 for 3 taxa.

A possible solution is to apply post-harvesting silvicultural treatments to increase the number of valuable trees. In this study we compared during 4years two treatments: tending naturally established seedlings/saplings of commercial species in logging gaps, and enrichment planting+tending seedlings of commercial species. In both treatments, competition was artificially reduced by liberating each focal seedling/sapling from competitors (i.e. other tree seedlings/saplings, lianas, or herbs). The experiment was carried out in an area of ombrophilous dense forest managed by the Orsa Florestal forestry company in Jari Valley, eastern Amazon, Brazil (01°09'S and 52°38'W). The company applies reduced-impact logging in a polycyclic silvicultural system. We sampled 64 2-year-old logging gaps (average area 427.2m2). Thirty-four gaps were used for the planting+tending, 15 gaps underwent the tending treatment, and there were 15 gaps in the control treatment (i.e. no intervention). The tending treatment showed lower mortality rate, faster growth rate, and required less liberation from overstorey plants and lianas than the other two treatments. Half of the species responded positively to tending: the long-lived pioneers Goupia glabra and Laetia procera, and the partially shade-tolerant Dinizia excelsa, Tachigali myrmecophila, and Trattinnickia sp. Similarly to tending, individuals subjected to the enrichment planting+tending treatment also presented higher growth rates. Based on these results we recommend tending be applied to areas with sufficient natural regeneration of commercial species. Enrichment planting+tending should be applied when regeneration of commercial species is scare, ideally using species that have high initial growth rates, and high commercial or conservation value. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Eastern Amazon; Forest management; Jari; Silviculture; Tropical forests","Schwartz, G.; Forest Ecology and Forest Management Group, P.O.

While methods for limiting logging damage and locating biological reserves have been developed, strategies focused on the sequence and arrangement of harvest units are lacking, particularly for situations in which species-specific knowledge is limited. We present a new landscape-level approach to forest conservation that anticipates local extinctions and focuses on facilitating re-colonization via strategic spatiotemporal harvest plans (which are informed by species occurrence data only). As a proof of concept, we applied our framework to data from four tropical forest sites and found clear benefits of optimized spatiotemporal harvest plans relative to non-optimized harvest plans (random and three pattern-based plans). Our proposed approach, termed the Optimized Floating Refugia strategy, requires minimal species-specific knowledge and can be used to enhance existing conservation efforts (e. g. biological reserve establishment, reduced-impact logging). The approach effectively prioritizes logging-sensitive habitat specialists with restricted ranges and thus provides the largest benefits to the most extinction-prone species. This simple but novel method shows promise as a general strategy to improve biodiversity conservation in species-rich production forest landscapes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Biodiversity; Forest management; Landscape-level planning; Logging; Spatiotemporal harvest planning; Tropical forest","Ramage, B.

Such knowledge is lacking and hard to acquire in resource poor regions such as West Africa's Upper Guinea where benefits of such schemes for forest conservation could have great impact.We undertook a systematic and representative survey of an entire Upper Guinea forest - Gola Forest in southeast Sierra Leone - by measuring over 600plots (0.125ha) in order to quantify the level of spatial variation in C that might exist within a discrete forest type and relate this to historic and contemporary impacts on the forest. We modelled current C stocks and compared these with values calculated from historic surveys. Mean C content in above ground biomass was c. 160Mgha-1. The southern part of the forest which was subject to heavier logging in the 1980s had a lower C content (121-144Mgha-1) compared to the less disturbed central areas (186Mgha-1). Volumes of extracted timber and distance to settlements around the forest explained 42% of the variation in C content. Elevation, slope and other metrics of human impact such as distance to roads did not explain significant additional variation. A survey from the 1950s recorded much higher carbon content than currently found in the south of the forest. This accords with evidence that commercial logging in this area was destructively high. However, old surveys from the late 1960s/early 1970s in less disturbed areas recorded lower carbon content than present. Most of the past surveys were in areas that had not yet been commercially logged so the accumulation in biomass in the last 40years implies recovery from a much older disturbance event, or a change in environmental conditions promoting growth.As a typical Upper Guinean forest, our results from Gola demonstrate the long term impacts of disturbance events on carbon stocks and how these can vary greatly at small scales, highlighting the need for representative and regionally relevant empirical data to inform REDD type initiatives. Nonetheless these forests remain important for carbon sequestration and storage in the region despite this history and the parts of the forest with no recorded logging activity that increased in carbon in recent decades with levels now akin to undisturbed plots reported from elsewhere in the region demonstrate the sequestration potential these forests provide once adequately protected. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Above ground biomass; Carbon; REDD; Sierra Leone; Upper Guinea","Lindsell, J.A.; The RSPB, , Sandy, Bedfordshire SG19 2DL, United Kingdom; email: jeremy.lindsell@rspb.org.uk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869875744

In that same time frame, an additional 50,815 km2 of forest was directly altered by timber harvesting and/or fire, equivalent to 30% of the area converted by deforestation.

In addition to inherent variation in disturbance sensitivity among taxa, another contributing factor is that most studies use comparative analyses of unlogged versus logged forests, which cannot fully account for heterogeneity in disturbance as well as underlying environmental gradients. To better understand how logging affects biodiversity, we examined changes in bat assemblages across a disturbance gradient ranging from old growth to forest logged several times. In one of the first evaluations of repeatedly logged forest, we use both comparative and gradient analyses to reveal substantial signals in assemblage change in response to habitat alteration. Despite multiple rounds of extraction in the most degraded forest, neither approach revealed a definitive effect of logging on site-based richness. However, each approach generated insight into assemblage compositional responses to forest degradation. Structural differences were evident between old-growth and repeatedly logged forest, and depauperate assemblages characterised degraded sites with low, open canopy. Ordinations identified species that best contributed to the signal of assemblage change, and also key associated forest-structure variables. Models of trap-based abundance confirmed not only the importance of forest height in determining assemblage change but also the role of tree-cavity availability in supporting forest specialists, indicating that efforts to supplement this resource could aid restoration. While highlighting the ecological importance of unlogged stands, we show that heavily degraded forests-even those that have been repeatedly logged-still hold some potential value for tropical biota and could have a role in conservation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Chiroptera; Conservation; Forest management; Habitat disturbance; Habitat restoration; Selective logging; Southeast Asia; Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems Project; Tree cavities; Tropical ecology","Struebig, M.J.; Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, , Canterbury, United Kingdom; email: m.j.struebig@kent.ac.uk",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883520497

We argue that REDD+ incentives should be available to commercial loggers who adopt IFM as long as carbon accounting is rigorous and safeguards are followed. Further, we argue that where full forest protection is not feasible, IFM should be advanced as a priority REDD+ strategy because it can (i) achieve robust emissions reductions without generating leakage or increasing the risk of non-permanence, (ii) generate a variety of local community benefits as a low-carbon development strategy, (iii) maintain native forest biodiversity, and (iv) reduce the likelihood of deforestation, particularly when forest management is community-based. We discuss solutions to some of the remaining challenges to creating incentives for IFM within a REDD+ mechanism. We encourage continued refinement of safeguards to ensure that verified climate benefits of IFM also generate social and biodiversity benefits. REDD+ financing is needed to catalyze the shift to IFM, but IFM should not be dependent (or at least not fully dependent) upon REDD+ financing for long-term financial viability. Measuring, monitoring, and validating emissions reductions from IFM have been a particular challenge, although new technologies and methods are promising. Technologies and methods used to account for avoided deforestation are usually not sensitive enough to detect changes in forest management practices. Funding is needed for research to develop and refine affordable methodologies for measuring, monitoring, and validating emissions reductions achieved through IFM. © Bronson W.

The total abundance was higher in the non managed area than in the managed forest. Species richness was higher in the managed forest than in the non managed area. The canopy openness affected the ferns abundance in the managed forest. The litter height variation did not affect ferns abundance in the managed forest. Although changing in species composition and abundance has been observed in the logging area, forest management can minimize the effects of conventional logging on ferns assemblies. © 2013 by Unisinos.","Biodiversity conservation; Ferns; Logging; Tropical forest","Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Research, Permoserstrasse 15, CEP: 04318, Leipzig, Saxônia, Alemanha, Germany",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877278150

Explanations for these increases, however, remain largely untested. Over an 8-yr period (1999-2007), we censused lianas in nine, 24 × 36 m permanent plots in old-growth and selectively logged forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica to test whether: (1) liana abundance and basal area are increasing in this forest; (2) the increase is being driven by increased recruitment, decreased mortality, or both; and (3) long-distance clonal colonization explains the increase in liana abundance and basal area. We defined long-distance clonal colonization as lianas that entered and rooted in the plots as vegetative propagules of stems that originated from outside or above the plot, and were present in 2007, but not in 1999 or 2002. Our hypotheses were supported in the old-growth forest: mean liana abundance and BA (≥1 cm diameter) increased 15 and 20 percent, respectively, and clonal colonization from outside of the plots contributed 19 and 60 percent (respectively) to these increases. Lianas colonized clonally by falling vertically from the forest canopy above or growing horizontally along the forest floor and re-rooting-common forms of colonization for many liana species. In the selectively logged forest, liana abundance and BA did not change, and thus the pattern of increasing lianas may be restricted to old-growth forests. In summary, our data support the hypothesis that lianas are increasing in old-growth forests, and that long-distance clonal colonization is a major contributor. © 2013 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2013 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","Climate change; Costa Rica; La Selva Biological Station; Recruitment; Succession; Vegetative reproduction","Schnitzer, S.A.; Department of Biological Sciences, P.O.

In this study, the richness and composition of ants were estimated and compared in forest submitted to reduced-impact logging techniques in Acre, Brazil. Ants were collected with pitfall traps and Winkler extractor method, in 30 plots of 10 x 10 m. Plots were equally distributed in three treatments: (1) logged - base of trees explored in 2007, (2) natural fall - base of naturally fallen trees in unlogged forest (3) control - a plot without falling tree in the same unlogged forest. Variables such as shrub and tree density, basal area of trees and fallen trees, leaf litter thickness and canopy coverage were estimated to characterizethe vegetation. Tree density was significantly higher in the control than in the logged treatments. Significant differences were found for canopy cover between control and logged treatments and control and natural fall treatments. A total of 88 ant species belonging to seven subfamilies were collected. Richness of ants did not differ among treatments. Although lower similarity was found between management and control treatments,there were no major differences in composition between them.

Most studies (88%) failed to include a pre-logging baseline condition in the sampling design, and the temporal scale of post-logging studies was generally inadequate. Studies also usually failed to report key information on study areas; only half of the articles reported some information on the spatial scale of the study, and only one-third presented some quantitative metric to describe forest habitat structure. Additionally, most studies (64%) failed to report the type of forest management and almost half (45%) did not describe the intensity of timber harvest in the logged areas. These sampling and reporting biases in logging studies hugely undermine the comparability among studies.

A topic of particular interest involves the assessment of the combined impacts of selective logging and forest fires. Forest disturbances by selective logging and forest fires may vary in scale, from local to global changes, mostly related to the increase of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Selective logging activities and forest fires have been reported by several studies as important agents of land-use and land-cover changes. Previous studies have focused on selective logging, but forest fires on a large scale in tropical regions have yet to be properly addressed. This study involved a more comprehensive investigation of temporal and basin-wide changes of forest disturbances by selective logging and forest fires using remotely sensed data acquired in 1992, 1996, and 1999. Landsat imagery and remote-sensing techniques for detecting burned forests and estimating forest canopy cover were applied. We also conducted rigorous ground measurements and observations to validate remote-sensing techniques and to assess canopy-cover impacts by selective logging and forest fires in three different states in the Brazilian Amazon. The results of this study showed a substantial increase in total forested areas impacted by selective logging and forest fires from approximately 11,800 to 35,600 km2 in 1992 and 1999, respectively. Selective logging was responsible for 60.4% of this forest disturbance in the studied period. Approximately 33% and 7% of forest disturbances detected in the same period were due to impacts of forest fires only and selective logging and forest fires combined, respectively. Most of the degraded forests (~90%) were detected in the states of Mato Grosso and Pará. Our estimates indicated that approximately 5467, 7618, and 17437 km2 were new areas of selective logging and/or forest fires in 1992, 1996, and 1999, respectively. Protected areas seemed to be very effective in constraining these types of forest degradation. Approximately 2.4% and 1.3% of the total detected selectively logged and burned forests, respectively, were geographically located within protected areas. We observed, however, an increasing trend for these anthropogenic activities to occur within the limits of protected areas from 1992 to 1999. Although forest fires impacted the least area of tropical forests in the study region, new areas of burned forests detected in 1996 and 1999 were responsible for the greatest impact on canopy cover, with an estimated canopy loss of 18.8% when compared to undisturbed forests. Selective logging and forest fires combined impacted even more those forest canopies, with an estimated canopy loss of 27.5%. Selectively logged forest only showed the least impact on canopy cover, with an estimated canopy loss of 5%. Finally, we observed that forest canopy cover impacted by selective logging activities can recover faster (up to 3 years) from impact when compared to those forests disturbed by fires (up to 5 years) in the Amazon region. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Matricardi, E.

In southern Ecuador, we examined three types of forests according to a disturbance gradient (primary forests, secondary forests, and monospecific forests of Alnus acuminata) for the presence/absence and coverage of epiphytic macrolichens that we identified on 240 trees. We found that total richness tended to decrease when the range of the disturbance increased. The impoverishment was particularly drastic for ""shade-adapted lichens"", while the richness of ""heliophytic lichens"" increased in the drier conditions of secondary growth. Epiphytic composition also differed significantly among the three types of forests, and the similarity decreased when the range of the disturbance was greater.

Monitoring studies or even surveys of species and community diversity in changing landscapes or disturbed areas require an assessment of the land cover changes over time. Here, we present a method combining remote sensing and structural equation models (SEM) to describe and analyse landscape dynamics. We focus on the mount Oku as an example, which is a mountain area located in north-west Cameroon. This site hosts the largest remaining tract of Central African cloud forest, a biodiversity hotspot threatened by contemporary land-use changes. Our aim is to characterize land cover changes over the last three decades and to quantify and elucidate the causes of deforestation and forest fragmentation. For this purpose, we integrate several Landsat satellite images taken between 1978 and 2007 in a Geographic Information System (GIS), and compare changes in land-use types. We assess forest fragmentation over this period by comparing the number, the area and the perimeter of forest fragments, and derive a forest fragmentation index. Finally, we quantify the respective effects of natural (altitude, slope) and human (human density, distance to villages) factors on deforestation using SEM. We evidence two periods in the dynamics of the cloud forest cover: a period of intense deforestation (1978-2001), followed by a period of re-afforestation (2001-2007). The forest cover lost 62.1% of its area (12,060 ha) between 1978 and 2001, corresponding to an averaged deforestation rate of 579 ha.yr-1. Deforested areas were mainly converted into crop lands (+75.6% between 1978 and 1988), under the pressure of an increasing human density, which was multiplied by 20 between 1921 and 2005 and doubled during the last 18 years. After 2001, the forest cover stabilized with the appearance of numerous small fragments of secondary forest, reflecting the success of the local biodiversity protection programs. Despite this recent progression of the forest cover, the proportion of ancient forest has continuously decreased from 1978 to 2007, indicating that deforestation is still ongoing. In 2007, the forest cover was a mosaic composed of 66% of recent secondary forests (i.e. forests appeared after 1978) and only 34% of ancient forests (i.e. present before 1978). Between 1978 and 2007, the number of forest fragments increased from 2627 to 5183, their average area decreased from 7.4 to 1.8 ha, and perimeter from 912 to 446 m, and the forest fragmentation index increased by 285.7%. Deforestation started from lower altitudes (&lt;2300 m, before 1988) and progressed towards higher altitudes (2100-2900 m) between 1988 and 2001. SEM showed that altitude and slope had a significant negative effect on human density, explaining why the deforestation has been low on steep slopes and/or at higher altitudes. Our study reveals that the last fragments of the primary cloud forest of mount Oku could be definitively lost in the next decades. As tropical primary forests are irreplaceable ecosystems that host numerous endemic species, we recommend (1) to urgently protect the last remnants of ancient forest for their biological value; clear-cuts, grazing in forest interior and fires should be excluded from these areas, and (2) to extend secondary forests around ancient forest fragments so that they can act as a protective buffer and be managed as community forests and used for hunting and logging activities.

At best, silvicultural considerations are typically only implied in the harvesting rules, rather than being explicitly considered in harvest planning and operations. Increasingly, companies are moving towards 100 percent enumeration of trees and tree mapping using GPS as part of reduced or low-impact logging systems. Use of GPS results in a spatial database of trees and key descriptors that could be used to plan future activities by modeling growth and yield to forecast key forest parameters, such as DBH and species, and to map the location of trees. Doing this would help to shift the focus of harvest planners and surveyors from operational to silvicultural considerations such as spacing, recruitment, and future crop trees, when planning harvesting. The main reason why companies are not doing this type of planning now is that the common tropical forest models use area-based parameters (whole stand models, size class models) that are only relevant to large scale planning. Typically these models do not make use of the spatial data that is generated in logging planning, require significantly more and different data that what is used in planning logging operations, and do not produce outputs that are relevant to operational harvest planning. What would be more useful are single- tree models that make use of spatial data, and that produce output that is operationally relevant, including diameter, species, and location of trees. The paper outlines operational requirements of reduced and low-impact logging systems and recommends yield modelling approaches that would work with these systems.","Reduced impact logging; Single tree model; Tropical forest planning","Bigsby, H.; Lincoln University, , Lincoln, Canterbury, New Zealand",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877975592

The matrix can have a direct influence on the edge effect. Most studies available examine the consequences of the interface between forest and agricultural areas or pasturelands. However, the effects of the creation of a water body have been little studied, despite being frequent in the last century. In this study, we analyze the edge effect in two faces of a fragment, the first edge in contact with sugarcane crop, and the second with a lake formed by a dam. To neutralize the effect of selective logging and avoid counting species established before the edge formation, we analyzed the composition and density of the juvenile layer (≤ 1m).

It was estimated the residual diametric structure to guarantee the necessary increment to recover the logged timber volume in a compartment of tropical forest in the state of Amazonas, in Brazil. The simulation of forest growth rate calculated after cutting when observing calculated tax and structure resulted in an increment that can recover the initial commercial volume during the cycle under consideration. It was observed in simulations that if the total commercial volume is removed in the beginning of the first logging cycle the forest will not recover the timber volume under the cycle in question. It was observed that approximately 81 % of the increment that is necessary to recover the volume logged was originated in the commercial residual classes (above 45 cm of diameter center class). It was identified an optimal class of diameter to be kept in the forest, above which the timber volume return is null.

Regular monitoring has to be capable of detecting rapid changes in forest extent, i.e. deforestation, and subtle changes to the forest cover caused by logging and/or fire, described as forest degradation. Particularly the early detection of illegal logging activities is important for the conservation of tropical forests. In the present study, a forest disturbance monitoring approach was developed and tested, which makes use of high resolution satellite imagery. A time series consisting of three images, acquired between May 2009 and June 2010, was analyzed covering a remote area of tropical peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The forest area was assessed by an object-oriented classification. Logging activities and the impact of fire were detected by a pixel-based spectral mixture analysis. Forest, non-forest and logging trails could be differentiated with an overall classification accuracy of 91.5% (Kappa of 0.87). A high forest disturbance rate of 8.7% was found in the study area. Low impact logging could be detected reliably and the progress was tracked over time. The results show that the timely detection of forest disturbances is necessary because of the fast regrowth of vegetation. The study emphasises the importance of high resolution satellite imagery for tropical forest monitoring and for timely updating forest status assessments, which is important for the implementation of REDD. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Activity data; deforestation; degradation; forest monitoring; Indonesia; mixture tuned matched filtering; RapidEye; REDD; spectral mixture analysis","Franke, J.; RSS-Remote Sensing Solutions GmbH, D-82065 Baierbrunn, Germany; email: franke@rssgmbh.de",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872087579

Forest fragmentation, hunting, and selective logging modify forests in myriad ways and their effects on animal-mediated seed dispersal have been examined in many case studies. However, the overall effects of different types of human disturbance on animal-mediated seed dispersal are still unknown. We identified 35 articles that provided 83 comparisons of animal-mediated seed dispersal between disturbed and undisturbed forests; all comparisons except one were conducted in tropical or subtropical ecosystems. We assessed the effects of forest fragmentation, hunting, and selective logging on seed dispersal of fleshy-fruited tree species. We carried out a meta-analysis to test whether forest fragmentation, hunting, and selective logging affected 3 components of animal-mediated seed dispersal: frugivore visitation rate, number of seeds removed, and distance of seed dispersal. Forest fragmentation, hunting, and selective logging did not affect visitation rate and were marginally associated with a reduction in seed-dispersal distance. Hunting and selective logging, but not fragmentation, were associated with a large reduction in the number of seeds removed. Fewer seeds of large-seeded than of small-seeded tree species were removed in hunted or selectively logged forests. A plausible explanation for the consistently negative effects of hunting and selective logging on large-seeded plant species is that large frugivores, as the predominant seed dispersers for large-seeded plant species, are the first animals to be extirpated from hunted or logged forests. The reduction in forest area after fragmentation appeared to have weaker effects on frugivore communities and animal-mediated seed dispersal than hunting and selective logging. The differential effects of hunting and selective logging on large- and small-seeded tree species underpinned case studies that showed disrupted plant-frugivore interactions could trigger a homogenization of seed traits in tree communities in hunted or logged tropical forests. ©2012 Society for Conservation Biology.","Frugivory; Habitat fragmentation; Hunting; Meta-analysis; Seed removal; Seed size; Selective logging; Tropical forest","Schleuning, M.; Biodiversity Climate Research Centre (BiK-F) Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung, Senckenberganlage 25, 60325 Frankfurt (Main), Germany; email: matthias.schleuning@senckenberg.de",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868659633

We examined the effect of selective logging on the bird community to help develop management guidelines to assure the conservation of biodiversity in forests managed for timber production. The study design consisted of control and harvested plots in piedmont and cloud forests of the subtropical montane forests of the Andes in northwestern Argentina. We conducted bird point-count surveys combined with distance estimation. Breeding season bird community composition was more similar between control and logged forest in both the cloud forest and piedmont, than between the two elevations, probably because Neotropical bird communities change dramatically along elevational gradients. Within each elevation zone, community composition changed significantly between harvested and control forests. Both between and within each elevation zone no significant differences in bird density were detected. Similarly, when we analyzed bird density according to diet guilds no general pattern could be extracted. However, we found a significantly greater density of cavity nesters and lower of non-cavity nesters in control plots, probably because most trees that can develop suitable cavities were extracted in logged plots and these plots had a greater structural diversity enabling more nesting resources. Grouping species according to their nesting habitat requirements has rarely been used in the neotropics and other tropical and subtropical forests, but focusing management attention on cavity nesters might address the most sensitive portion of the avian community as well as other species dependent on trees likely to hold cavities. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Andes; Austral Yungas; Cavity nesters; Diet; Guild; Logging","Politi, N.; Department of Wildlife Ecology, , Orono, ME, United States; email: natipoliti@yahoo.com.ar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870362122

This study aims at improving the knowledge of the species' ecological parameters, and at assessing the impact of selective logging on its populations in an 118,052 ha forest in Cameroon. After inventorying the species in 1432 ha, mortality and growth were assessed over continuous 5- and 2-yr periods in unlogged and logged areas, respectively. Phenology was monitored in the unlogged forest during 5 yr. The population structure shows high relative abundance of trees in medium size categories. Mean annual diameter increments in both environments did not differ significantly between unlogged and logged areas. P. elata is a deciduous species that flowers at the end of the main dry season. The minimum reproduction and effective flowering diameters were 32 and 37 cm, respectively. Fruit maturation took place during 7 mo. With a minimum logging diameter of 90 cm, the recovery rate computed over a 30-yr period was > 100 percent.

It remains still unclear to what extent disturbance-mediated species changes scale-up to changes in community functional properties, especially for species-rich tropical forests. A large-scale field experiment was performed in which the dynamics of 15 000 stems >10 cm in diameter was monitored for 8 years in 44 one-ha forest plots. Twelve functional effect and response traits were measured for the most dominant tree species. The effects of different intensities of disturbance caused by logging and silvicultural treatments on the species and functional diversity of a Bolivian tropical forest community were evaluated, along with how these changes were driven by underlying demographic processes. Disturbance treatments did not affect species diversity or functional diversity indices based on multiple traits related to primary productivity and decomposition rate. This result suggests that species richness is conserved, and trait variation is maintained, which can buffer the community against environmental change. In contrast, disturbance intensity affected the average plant trait values in the community (the community-weighted mean) for seven of 12 traits evaluated. At high disturbance intensity, the community had a lower wood density of stem and branches, lower leaf toughness and dry matter content, but higher specific leaf area and leaf N- and P concentration, with the value of these traits changing on average 6% over the 8-year period. The functional spectrum of the community changed, therefore, from 'slow', conservative, shade-tolerant species towards 'fast', acquisitive, light-demanding species. These functional changes in mean trait values may enhance primary productivity and decomposition rate in the short term. Temporal changes in community functional properties were mainly driven by recruitment, and little by mortality or survival. Synthesis. Moderate levels of (logging) disturbance neither affected species diversity nor functional diversity per se in the 8-year period after logging. Disturbance did, however, change the functional community composition towards 'fast' species with more acquisitive traits, thus potentially fuelling primary productivity and nutrient and carbon cycling. In conclusion, tropical forest management may contribute to conserving functional biodiversity of trees while providing forest resources. © 2012 The Authors.

The reduced-impact logging (RIL) is considered a less destructive method of timber harvesting, but there is a general lack of information about the effects on Amazonian invertebrates, including butterflies. We investigated the effect of RIL on fruit-feeding butterflies by comparing canopy and understory between an area under RIL and a control area without RIL. The canopy fauna is different and significantly richer than the understory fauna, showing that sampling only the lower strata underestimates the diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies. The effects of RIL were mainly detected in the understory butterfly assemblage, as significant differences were observed in species composition within this stratum. Effects of the RIL regime, which include tree cutting, skid trails and roads openings, are stronger in the understory than in the canopy, explaining the reported differences. Despite the detectable effects of RIL on the composition of fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages, the overall diversity was not affected. A similar pattern has been detected in many other groups, indicating that a noticeable part of the diversity of many taxa could be preserved in areas under RIL management. Therefore, in view of the problems of creating protected areas in the Amazon, RIL is a good alternative to preserve fruit-feeding butterflies and surely many other taxa, and it might be a desirable economic alternative for the region. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Canopy; Ecological indicators; Forest degradation; Nymphalidae; Tropical; Understory","Ribeiro, D.

This paper examines how forest fires affect REDD+ schemes by compromising carbon permanence; undermining the potential of sustainable forest management and reforestation and regeneration activities in tropical countries; and threatening the additional benefits that can be accrued from REDD+, including biodiversity conservation and rural poverty alleviation. Narrowly focusing on avoiding deforestation, the sustainable management of forests or regeneration schemes will not always guarantee protection from fire occurrence, and investments in tropical forests may ultimately fail to achieve long-term emission reductions unless they also reduce the risk of forest fires. Integrating forest fire reduction into REDD+ presents many challenges, requiring: changes in agricultural practices that take place outside of the remaining forests; the monitoring and prediction of spatio-temporal patterns of forest fires across whole biomes; guarantees of additionality; avoiding leakage of fire-dependent agriculture; ensuring that responsibilities for fire management are fairly distributed; protection for rural livelihoods; and that any new activities result in positive outcomes for local people. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Fire; Livelihoods; Rainforests","Barlow, J.; Lancaster Environment Centre, , Lancaster LA1 4YQ, United Kingdom; email: josbarlow@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865712878

However, few studies have addressed the relative importance of disturbance, topography, climate, soil and methods for stem measurement, on the estimation of AGC, or the costs of improving AGC estimates by altering sample regimes. We established 18 one hectare plots containing 7201 stems, stratified along forested elevation gradients in Tanzania. We recorded a broad set of physical, climatic and edaphic predictors of AGC and tree stature. AGC estimates using stem diameter, height and wood density, gave a mean value of 174.6tha -1, compared with 229.6tha -1 when height was excluded. Regression models revealed that stems were tallest for a given diameter at mid-elevation (1000-1250m), on south-facing slopes, and without past logging. High AGC was strongly associated with shallow slopes, followed by intermediate elevation, elephant absence, low potential evapotranspiration and low soil pH. Further regression models to investigate the structural habitat features associated with AGC, revealed significant positive influence of basal area, stem density, and height:diameter ratio, rather than the mean wood density of species present. Large stems (≥70cmdbh; 4.6% of stems) contained 52% of AGC in all plots, declining to 36% in lowland plots. We discuss the cost:benefit of different measurements and recommend a tiered approach to AGC monitoring, depending on available resources. AGC assessments in African forests could exclude small stems, but should aim to record disturbance, topography and species. Stem height is vital for AGC estimation and valuation; when excluding height our 55tha -1 over-estimation of AGC would have over-valued the carbon resource by 24% (US$3300ha -1). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Allometry; Climate change; Conservation; Eastern Arc; Monitoring","Marshall, A.R.; CIRCLE, , York YO10 5DD, United Kingdom; email: andy.marshall@york.ac.uk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865709642

The Dimako formula, that is the legal expression of the stock recovery rate, is not necessarily the best estimate of this index. In particular, it accounts for only a limited knowledge on vital rates, it does not always increase with the diameter cutting limit, and it is negatively sensitive to the number of trees above the cutting limit, which may promote heavy initial logging when assessing forest management over several felling cycles. Here, we show that the Dimako formula can be generalised by using a more detailed model of forest dynamics, or a finer description of logging damage, and we demonstrate that an alternative formula has better properties. We used four species with contrasted initial diameter distribution, inventoried in the Dimako forest, eastern Cameroon, to illustrate the behaviour of alternative formula. If an increased level of details had to be incorporated in the Dimako formula, boosted post-logging growth should be considered at first. Because the stock recovery rate results from the combined influence of the initial dbh distribution of the species, which is a history-dependent feature of the population, and of its vital rates, which is an ecological species-specific feature of the population, its interpretation must at least take account of the autecology of the species. Particular caution must be taken when applying the formula to groups of species rather than to single species. The stock recovery rate alone gives a reductionist insight into yield sustainability. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Central Arica; Population dynamics; Sock recovery rate; Sustainable management; Topical forests","Picard, N.; CIRAD, BP 4035, Libreville, Gabon; email: nicolas.picard@cirad.fr",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863696385

Thus, setting aside remaining natural forests for conservation purposes is nearly impossible. Balancing economic activities, such as logging, with conservation programs will play an important role in conserving the rich biodiversity typical of these regions. Therefore, the effects of logging on biodiversity need to be more thoroughly understood. To address this, we simulated the recovery of avian communities following a variety of potential logging schemes that varied by the logging interval (1-100 years) and the wood volume left after harvesting (0-100%). The recovery rate of forest generalists was very high during the first 15 years of succession and then became asymptotic. The recovery rate of forest specialists remained high until about 50 years of succession. After 50 years, the recovery rate was lower, and fewer bird species colonized in subsequent years. Logging schemes with either a logging cycle >15 years or wood volume left after harvesting >30% resulted in 70% of the regional forest bird species pool being conserved. The results from these simulations suggest that logging schemes with either cycle lengths >40 years or wood volume left after harvest >55% should be implemented to conserve 80% of the species pool. Our simulations provide a prediction of how avian communities could be affected under different logging schemes and can provide guidance to management agencies in developing, forested tropical countries. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Avian community; Forest generalists; Forest management; Forest specialists; Logging; Southeast Asia; Tropical natural forest","Thinh, V.T.; Department of Wildlife, , Xuan Mai, Chuong My, Hanoi, Viet Nam; email: vutienthinh@hotmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864065372

It concludes that climate is the strongest driver of tree and forest growth and that climate change may therefore have large consequences for forest productivity and carbon sequestration. However, serious methodological and conceptual discrepancies have been found that challenge these conclusions. 2.Because of an errant coding of 'time after logging' in the regression analysis, and because floristic changes induced by logging could not be incorporated into the analysis, the effect of logging on the average diameter growth is likely to have been strongly underestimated. 3.Basal area growth was improperly calculated as basal area change, and it displayed surprisingly high values, even among unlogged plots. We hypothesize that either these plots may be actually located in secondary forests recovering from past logging, or measurement biases may have hampered the data set. 4.Regardless of climate-growth relationships established across these plots, any inference concerning the potential effects of climate change on forest growth would require a specific quantitative assessment. 5.Synthesis. It is critical to re-assess the relative weight of climate and logging disturbance as driving factors of tree and forest growth, and to find an explanation for the very high basal area increment reported among the unlogged plots.

We took advantage of one of the largest data sets in the Neotropics, consisting of 165 1-ha plots and over 62000 trees distributed over an area of c. 160000km 2, across large environmental gradients in lowland Bolivia. The main findings were that climate was the strongest driver of spatial variation in tree growth, whereas soils had only a modest effect on growth and that the effect of logging disappeared after a few years. 2.Ferry (2012) suggest that we underestimated the disturbance effects on growth because of a supposedly wrong coding of Time After Logging (TAL) for unlogged plots. Although we have good biological reasons why we coded TAL like we did, we checked Ferry et al.'s suggestions for recoding and found no differences in variables that significantly explained tree and forest growth. We agree, however, that for future research, it is important to go beyond simple descriptors such as time after logging and basal area logged, to better describe the variation in logging impact found in areas under forest management. 3.Ferry et al. claim that we did not define basal area growth properly. We believe this is a semantic issue, as we clearly defined basal area growth as the net change in basal area. This net basal area change in Bolivian forests is indeed relatively high compared to other studies, which may be attributed to the higher soil fertility and biogeographic differences in species composition and their traits. 4.Synthesis. Many apparent discrepancies in the ecological literature arise because tropical forest ecologists tend to see the world from the perspective of their 'own' forest (despite clear biogeographic differences) and try to capture the same ecological processes using different variables and measurement protocols. To advance our understanding and go beyond single-case studies, we need to assemble large databases, quantify forest dynamics and disturbances in similar ways, be aware of differences among forests and analyse environmental dose-response curves. © 2012 British Ecological Society.","Bolivia; Climate; Disturbance; Logging; Plant-climate interactions; Tree growth; Tropical forest","Poorter, L.; Forest Ecology and Forest Management Group, PO Box 47, 6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; email: lourens.poorter@wur.nl",Note,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865301060

For the present study, seed rain composition of small and large forest fragments (8-388ha) was assessed in order to identify variations in seed abundance, species richness, seed size and dispersal mode. Seed rain was documented during a 1-year period in three large and four small Atlantic Forest fragments that are isolated by a sugarcane matrix. Total seed rain included 20,518 seeds of 149 species of trees, shrubs, palms, lianas and herbs. Most species and seeds were animal-dispersed. A significant difference in the proportion of seeds and species within different categories of seed size was found between small and large fragments. Small fragments received significantly more very small-sized seeds (<0.3cm) and less large-seeded species (>1.5cm) that were generally very rare, with only one species in small and eight in large fragments. We found a negative correlation between the inflow of small-sized seeds and the percentage of forest cover. Species richness was lower in small than in large fragments, but the difference was not very pronounced. Given our results, we propose changing plant species pools through logging, tree mortality and a high inflow of pioneer species and lianas, especially in small forest fragments and areas with low forest cover. Connecting forest fragments through corridors and reforestation with local large-seeded tree species may facilitate the maintenance of species diversity. © 2012 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Brazilian Atlantic Forest; Forest cover; Fragmentation; Seed rain; Seed size","Knörr, U.C.; State Museum of Natural History, Rosenstein 1, 70191 Stuttgart, Germany; email: knoerru@yahoo.de",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864761269

The study area consisted of three management units, two of which were unlogged, while the third unit was selectively logged at a low intensity (approximately 10-15m 3 ha -1 or 5-8% of total volume). A systematic random sample of fifty 0.25-ha ground plots were measured and used to construct lidar-based regression models for above ground biomass (AGB). A lidar model-assisted approach was used to estimate AGB for the logged and unlogged units (using both synthetic and model-assisted estimators). Two lidar explanatory variables, computed at a spatial resolution of 50m×50m, were used in these predictions: 1) the first quartile height of all above ground returns (P25); and, 2) variance of the height above ground of all returns (VAR). The model-assisted AGB estimator (total 231,589Mg±5,477 SE; mean 231.6Mg ha -1±5.5 SE; ±2.4%) was more precise than plot-only simple random sample estimator (total 230,872Mg±10,477 SE; mean 230.9Mg ha -1±10.5 SE; ±4.5%). The total and mean AGB estimates obtained using the synthetic estimator (total 231,694Mg; mean 231.7Mg ha -1) were nearly equal those obtained using the model-assisted estimator. In a second component of the analysis lidar metrics were also computed at 1m×1m resolution to identify areas impacted by logging activities within the selectively harvested management unit. A high-resolution canopy relative density model (RDM) was used in GIS to identify and delineate roads, skidtrails, landings and harvested tree gaps. The area impacted by selective logging determined from the RDM was 58.4ha or 15.4% of the total management unit. Using these two spatial resolutions of lidar analyses it was possible to identify differences in AGB in selectively logged areas that had relatively high levels of residual overstory canopy cover. The mean AGB obtained from the synthetic estimator was significantly lower in impacted areas than in undisturbed areas of the selectively logged management unit (p=0.01). © 2012 .","Airborne laser scanning; Amazon forest monitoring; Forest biomass; Lidar; Selective logging; Tropical forest monitoring","Reutebuch, S.E.; USDA Forest Service, PO Box 352100, Seattle, WA, United States; email: sreutebuch@fs.fed.us",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863203870

In this study, we concurrently examined the responses of the avian frugivore community and the community of fruiting trees to past logging in a tropical forest in northeastern India. We predicted that the abundance of, and visitation by large-bodied frugivores would be lower in logged forests, resulting in reduced seed dispersal and recruitment of biotically dispersed species (especially large-seeded species). Data were collected from two logged and unlogged sites using (a) belt transects for estimating avian frugivore abundance (b) fruiting tree watches to quantify frugivore visitation and (c) vegetation plots to characterize recruitment. Our results show that differences in the abundance of bird species between logged and unlogged sites was correlated with body mass, with larger species being scarcer and smaller species more abundant in logged areas. Correspondingly, visitation rates by large avian frugivores was lower in logged compared with unlogged sites. Finally, biotically dispersed tree species, especially large-seeded species, had lower recruitment in logged forests, potentially due to lowered visitation rates and decreased fruit removal by large bodied avian frugivores.

Concern has recently been expressed, however, that management interventions to increase carbon stocks may conflict with biodiversity conservation. Focusing on a large-scale rainforest rehabilitation project in northern Borneo, we examine the broad impacts of selective logging and subsequent carbon enhancement across a wide range of invertebrate fauna by comparing the abundance of 28 higher-level taxa within two separate rainforest strata (leaf-litter and understorey) across unlogged, naturally-regenerating and rehabilitated forest. We additionally assess changes in functional composition by examining responses of different feeding guilds. Responses of individual taxa to forest management were idiosyncratic but logging resulted in more than a 20% increase in total invertebrate abundance, with fewer than 20% of taxa in either stratum having significantly lower abundance in logged forest. Rehabilitation resulted in a marked reduction in abundance, particularly among leaf-litter detritivores, but overall, there were much smaller differences between unlogged and rehabilitated forest than between unlogged and naturally regenerating forest in both total invertebrate abundance and the abundances of different feeding guilds. This applied to both strata with the exception of understorey herbivores, which were more abundant in rehabilitated forest than elsewhere.

Here we evaluate the compatibility of these aims by examining the effects of logging on taxonomic and functional diversity and composition in a tropical forest. 2.Twenty years after selective logging, we inventoried 4140 stems regenerating in logging gaps and adjacent undisturbed areas, and we integrated a database of 13 functional traits describing leaf and wood economics of tropical trees. 3.We found no differences in taxonomic and functional richness among habitats, but logging gaps had significantly higher taxonomic and functional evenness. 4.Logging also effected striking, long-term changes in both species and functional composition. In particular, the xylem density of recruits in logging gaps was 6% less than in unlogged forests, leaves were 11% less tough and had 6-13% greater mineral nutrient concentrations. 5.Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that managers of tropical forests should limit overall surface area converted to logging gaps by creating fewer, larger gaps during selective logging, to reduce impacts on the taxonomic and functional composition of the regenerating stand.

However, studies using both phylogenetic- and trait-based methods have been mainly conducted in old-growth forests, with fewer studies in human-disturbed communities, which play an increasingly important role in providing ecosystem services as primary forests are degraded. We used data from 18 1-ha plots in tropical old-growth forests and secondary forests with different disturbance histories (logging and shifting cultivation) and vegetation types (tropical lowland and montane forests) on Hainan Island, southern China. The distributions of 11 functional traits were compared among these six forest types. We used a null model approach to assess the effects of disturbance regimes on variation in response and effect traits and community phylogenetic structure across different stem sizes (saplings, treelets, and adult trees) and spatial scales (10-50 m). We found significant differences in the distribution of functional traits in highly disturbed lowland sites versus other forest types. Many individuals in highly disturbed lowland sites were deciduous, spiny, with non-fleshy fruits and seeds dispersed passively or by wind, and low SLA. The response traits of coexisting species were clustered in all sites except for highly disturbed lowland sites where evenness was evident. There were different distributions of effect traits for saplings and treelets among different forest types but adult trees showed stronger clustering of trait values with increasing spatial scale among all forest types. Phylogenetic clustering predominated across all size classes and spatial scales in the highly disturbed lowland sites, and evenness in other forest types. High disturbance can lead to abiotic filtering, generating a community dominated by closely related species with disturbance-adapted traits, where biotic interactions play a relatively minor role. In lightly disturbed and old growth forests, multiple processes simultaneously drive the community assembly, but biotic processes dominate at the fine scale. © 2011 The Authors.

A recent Presidential Instruction in Indonesia outlines a key deliverable of this "" Partnership"" -a two-year suspension on new concessions for clearing or logging of peat and old-growth forest. Here, we discuss the implications of this instruction for carbon and biodiversity protection. The protection of highly threatened deep peatlands represents a clear victory. However, by focusing solely on old-growth forests, the instruction excludes over 46. million ha of selectively logged rainforests, which often have high carbon storage and biodiversity. This leaves the logged forests, most of which are in accessible lowland areas, highly vulnerable to re-logging and conversion for oil palm and pulpwood plantations. The instruction also could allow large areas of peatlands and old-growth forest to be converted to sugarcane-one of the world's most rapidly expanding biofuel crops. While the Partnership could potentially help reform land-use planning and reduce illegal deforestation in Indonesia, we argue that Indonesia must also strive to protect vulnerable logged forests, which comprise a large part of the country's high-carbon, high-biodiversity lands. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon trading; Peat forest; REDD, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation; Selective logging; Southeast Asia; Sugarcane; Sundaland; Tropical forest","Edwards, D.P.; Centre for Tropical Environmental and Sustainability Science (TESS), , Cairns, QLD 4878, Australia; email: dave.edwards@jcu.edu.au",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862027919

We argue that many logging studies are conducted at small spatial scales or over inadequate time periods, and are biased against finding significant negative impacts. This is because of confounding environmental differences between logged and unlogged forests as well as the prolonged nature of forest stand development. Human perceptions of logging also can be biased by the 'shifting baseline' phenomenon, and by an incorrect perception that logging operations approximate natural disturbance regimes.

There are three principal reasons why logging of native tropical forests resembles the mining of a non-renewable resource: the standard cutting cycle of 30-40. years is too brief to allow the wood volume to regenerate; tropical logging catalyses considerable deforestation; and the bulk of logging is undertaken by multinational corporations with little interest in long-term local sustainability. Unless something fundamental changes, we believe tropical forests will continue to be overharvested and cleared apace, leading to an inevitable global decline in tropical timbers of non-plantation origin.

These forests are being altered at a rapid rate, especially by industrial logging and swidden farming. Wildfires, expanding oil palm plantations, and industrial mining are also causing forest loss. At current rates of exploitation, most industrially accessible forests in PNG are projected to be logged or cleared in just 1-2 decades. Much of the country's timber is exported as raw logs, mainly to China, providing only limited income and employment for local communities. Despite growing exploitation of its natural resources, many social indicators in PNG, such as per-capita income, literacy, and the Human Development Index, remain alarmingly low. We highlight a range of near-term policy measures designed to improve forest conservation and sustainability in PNG. These include: (1) reducing annual timber harvests to a more-sustainable level, (2) curtailing raw-log exports while promoting expansion of domestic wood-processing industries, (3) combating serious corruption in the forestry sector, (4) reinstating the rights of traditional communities in PNG to sue corporations for past or anticipated environmental damage, (5) expanding and improving the management of protected areas, and (6) stabilizing the administration of international carbon-trading funds designed to reduce emissions from forest conversion. We also recommend that educational and family-planning support be improved for younger women to help reduce the destabilizing effects of rapid population growth. These measures will help to reduce environmental damage and slow the exhaustion of timber supplies, while improving societal benefits for PNG citizens. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon-trading; Corruption; Deforestation; Forest management; Globalization; Governance; Logging; Multinational corporations; Papua New Guinea; REDD; Tropical timber","Laurance, W.F.; Centre for Tropical Environmental and Sustainability Science (TESS), , Cairns, QLD 4878, Australia; email: bill.laurance@jcu.edu.au",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862002578

Although Sri Lanka is a severely threatened biodiversity hot spot with high endemicity and unique conservation challenges, few have investigated how fauna respond to environmental perturbations caused by human modification of habitats. We investigated differences in the diversity and community composition of amphibians and butterflies in primary and selectively logged forests (SLF), home gardens and plantations in the Sinharaja lowland tropical forest and surrounding areas. A Bayesian multi-model inference approach was then used to identify environmental variables that explained differences in richness and abundance patterns among sites. Amphibian species richness (SPR) was highest in a forest habitat, and community composition differed between forest and disturbed habitats. In contrast, butterfly SPR increased with increasing disturbance. Butterfly diversity patterns were best explained by climatic variables, while structural habitat parameters were the best predictors of amphibian patterns. Based on research findings, the protection of primary forest habitats is essential for amphibian conservation. Regenerating SLF can be of high conservation value especially if substantial pristine habitat remains conserved in the landscape. Anthropogenic habitats at the periphery of forests require realistic management recommendations to support the species inhabiting, visiting or migrating through them. Different environmental predictors for butterflies and amphibians underscore the importance of including multiple indicator taxa in surveys that are intended to inform habitat management. © 2011 The Authors.

The minimum technical standards necessary for approaching ecological sustainability directly contravene the prospects for financial profitability. Therefore, industrial-scale SFM is likely to lead to the degradation and devaluation of primary tropical forests as surely as widespread conventional unmanaged logging does today. Recent studies also show that logging in the tropics, even using SFM techniques, releases significant carbon dioxide and that carbon stocks once stored in logged timber and slash takes decades to rebuild. These results beg for a reevaluation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change proposals to apply a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation subsidy for the widespread implementation of SFM logging in tropical forests.

Reliable estimates of aboveground biomass stocks within the Atlantic Forest are rarely available. Past human disturbance is an important factor affecting forest structure variation and biomass accumulation among tropical forest ecosystems. To support the efforts of improving the quality of estimations of the current and future biomass carbon storage capacity of this disturbed forest region we tested a non-experimental small scale approach to compare the aboveground tree biomass (AGB) of forest sites. Three sites with known disturbance histories have been investigated: complete cut down, selective logging and conservation since 70 years. The woody plant community (dbh ≥ 10 cm) was censused and canopy openness in conjunction with leaf area index has been obtained by hemispherical photographs at each site. Estimates of aboveground tree biomass have been carried out using an allometric equation for moist tropical forests already applied for the study area. Additionally, a FAO standard equation has been employed for crosschecking our results. We identified significant differences in recent AGB of the three compared forest sites. With 313 (±48 Mg ha -1) the highest AGB-values have been found in the preserved forest area within a National Park, followed by 297 (±83) Mg ha -1 at the former clear cut site. Lowest AGB has been calculated for the area with past selective logging: 204 (±38) Mg ha -1. Values calculated with the FAO standard equation showed the same trend but at a lower AGB level. Our results based an a small scale approach suggest that biomass productivity can recover in a forest which was completely cleared 60 years ago to reach AGB values up to a level that almost represents the situation in a preserved forest. Selective logging may slow down AGB accumulation and the effect is measurable after several decades. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Aboveground live biomass; Atlantic Forest; Forest succession; Land use; Tropical forests","Lindner, A.; Department of Systematic Botany and Functional Biodiversity, Johannisallee 21-23, 04103 Leipzig, Germany; email: alindner@uni-leipzig.de",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859971371

To develop better management strategies, it is necessary to analyse the dynamics of these forests at different scales and to assess their potential to recover from natural or human disturbances. This study combines broad and fine scales to investigate temporal changes: at broad scale we use aerial photos (from 1949, 1962, and 1999) and GIS to document land-cover change during a long-term period of 50 years; at fine scale we use spatial gradient analyses to document changes in species composition during a short-term period of four years. Re-sampling of the same elevational gradient (100-460 m a.s.l.) provides both a spatial and temporal gradient. Plausible causal links between human impact and documented changes are evaluated by means of ordination and Monte Carlo permutation tests. Density and diversity of seedlings, juveniles, shrubs, and trees were investigated in permanent plots from 2003 to 2007 along an elevational gradient. Approximately 17% of the forest has been lost during the last 50 years; giving an annual forest decline of 0.33%. The forest degradation during the 50 years in northern Peru was mainly due to agricultural expansion. During 1949-1962 forest declined by only 1.7%, while a greater forest decline took place during 1962-1999 (15% decline). Reasons for the greater forest loss during 1962-1999 are discussed. A new agrarian land reform from 1969 and population increases are likely reasons. The gradient analyses show a clear increase in species richness and spatial turnover in species composition along the elevational gradient. The ordination analysis reveals a significant change in species composition from 2001 to 2005, and we hypothesise that this may relate to browsing and logging activities. Although the number of faeces and signs of logging did not have a significant correlation with the ordination axes, the Monte Carlo permutation test in redundancy analysis (RDA) reveals a significant effect of browsing on species composition. The changes in species richness and species composition with elevation may be due to climatic differences between the lowland and upland mountain study area, rather than different intensity of human land use. Browsing and logging activities take place quite evenly over the entire study area, rather than being restricted to a certain area. Re-sampling of the permanent plots reveals that the lowland species Prosopis pallida was the only species able to survive from seedling stage to juvenile stage during the four-year investigation period. About 30% of the Prosopis pallida seedlings developed into juveniles, which indicates that this species may be better adapted to drought than other species in this environment.","Deforestation; Fine and broad scales; Forest dynamics; Fragmentation; Human impact; Matrix; Pro- sopis pallida; Recruitment","Ektvedt, T.

Compliance with reduced impact logging was very low, with poor planning in logging operations detected in all cases, highly affecting forest stands and biomass recovery. A limited capacity for monitoring was also found. Social assessments showed that local communities in all cases demanded more participation in wood production benefits and tended to value provision services such as timber, food and water above other important regulations and cultural services.

In the tri-national frontier region of Madre de Dios (Peru), Acre (Brazil), and Pando (Bolivia) in Western Amazonia, we evaluated perceptions of representatives from four stakeholder groups - communities, industries (Brazil nut and timber), non-governmental organizations, and government agencies - on integrated management of timber and Brazil nuts (from the tree species Bertholletia excelsa) at multiple scales. A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis in combination with an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to accomplish this task. Overall, results showed distinct differences in perceptions among stakeholder groups both within and among countries in pursuing multiple-use forestry strategies. Although many stakeholder groups held positive perceptions about multiple use of Brazil nuts and timber, several limitations were associated with implementation of this model. For instance, policy barriers and high management costs were considered the main weaknesses throughout the region. In Madre de Dios and Pando, logging damage to Brazil nut stands was the dominant threat, whereas in Acre, the main threat was reinvestment of forestry income into cattle. Our work shows that despite the high potential for and positive views of many stakeholders in pursuing integrated management of Brazil nut and timber, specific policy, economic, and technical limitations must first be addressed.

Many tropical forests are exploited both commercially for timber and by forest-dependent communities for non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Divergences between these two uses may have significant implications for forest-dependent livelihoods. This article gathers existing examples of conflicts and complementarities between selective logging and non-timber uses of forest from the livelihood perspective. Additionally it draws on three case studies from Brazil, Cameroon and Indonesia to examine by what mechanisms, and to what extent, logging impacts forest resources of livelihood importance, as well as to consider how factors such as logging regime and forest management system may mediate such influences. By doing so we aim to shed further light on a relatively unacknowledged issue in tropical forest management and conservation.Four specific mechanisms were identified; conflict of use and the indirect impacts of logging being those most commonly implicated in negative effects on livelihood-relevant NTFPs. Eighty two percent of reviewed articles highlighted negative impacts on NTFP availability. Examples of positive impacts were restricted to light demanding species that respond to the opening of forest structure and typically represent a small subset of those of livelihood value. Despite considerable impacts on livelihoods, in all three case studies we found evidence to support the potential for enhanced compatibility between timber extraction and the subsistence use of NTFPs. Drawing on this evidence, and findings from our review, we make specific recommendations for research, policy and management implementation. These findings have significant implications for reconciling timber and non-timber uses of tropical forests. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Livelihood; Multiple-use; NTFP; Reduced impact logging; Sustainable forest management; Timber","Rist, L.; Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, , 90187 Umeå, Sweden; email: lucy.rist@emg.umu.se",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857031430

Yet the extent to which foresters across the tropics implement adaptation actions in anticipation to climate change impacts remains largely unexplored. In this paper, an assessment of the perceptions of climate risks and the implementation of adaptation actions by forest managers and decision makers dealing with natural and planted tropical forests destined for production purposes is presented. An electronic questionnaire was disseminated globally during 2009, and 152 responses were received from Africa, the Americas, and Asia and the Pacific. Respondents perceived that natural and planted forests are at risk from being affected by climate change. However, they seemed ambivalent when asked if investing in adaptation was currently justified. The results of this survey provide initial insights into how climate considerations are being anticipated in tropical forest management and planning yet further examination at the national and local levels is warranted on how foresters, including those from the tropics, perceive climate change risks and handle current uncertainties in order to take action. The fact that climate change ranked below other threats to forests such as commercial agriculture and unplanned logging nevertheless suggests that long-term forest planning and management is not perceived by respondents as viable given other major drivers of forest loss and degradation.","adaptation; adaptive capacity; mitigation; risk perception; tropical forests","Guariguata, M.R.; Center for International Forestry Research, PO BOX 0113 BOCBD, Bogor 16000, Indonesia; email: m.guariguata@cgiar.org",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859076975

This rapid exchange of carbon dioxide between the forest and the atmosphere make humid tropical forests one of the most dynamic C pools on Earth.

Compliance with common standards of good commercial practice requires identification of all species of conservation significance which occur within their areas of management responsibility. But, as we demonstrate, it is impossible for companies to do this comprehensively. Such demands are often counterproductive in that they alienate those who might otherwise be willing to improve. Given the finite resources available for achieving conservation outcomes, we need to trade off data collection against other costs. To encourage adoption and implementation of conservation friendly practices requires incentives, not technical and financial obstacles.

Here we examine the extent to which these forests sustain timber production, retain species, and conserve carbon stocks. We then describe some improvements in tropical forestry and how their implementation can be promoted. A simple meta-analysis based on >100 publications revealed substantial variability but that: timber yields decline by about 46% after the first harvest but are subsequently sustained at that level; 76% of carbon is retained in once-logged forests; and, 85-100% of species of mammals, birds, invertebrates, and plants remain after logging. Timber stocks will not regain primary-forest levels within current harvest cycles, but yields increase if collateral damage is reduced and silvicultural treatments are applied. Given that selectively logged forests retain substantial biodiversity, carbon, and timber stocks, this ""middle way"" between deforestation and total protection deserves more attention from researchers, conservation organizations, and policy-makers. Improvements in forest management are now likely if synergies are enhanced among initiatives to retain forest carbon stocks (REDD+), assure the legality of forest products, certify responsible management, and devolve control over forests to empowered local communities. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Biodiversity conservation; FLEGT; Forest carbon; REDD; Sustainable forest management; Tropical forestry; Tropical silviculture","Putz, F.E.; Department of Biology, P.O. 118526, 209 Carr Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611-8526, United States; email: fep@ufl.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864814238

Smallfootprint LiDAR (light detection and ranging) systems have proven to successfully correlate to above ground biomass (AGB) estimates in boreal and temperate forests. Their applicability to two different tropical rainforest types (lowland dipterocarp and peat swamp forest) in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, was tested by developing multiple regression models at plot level using full waveform LiDAR point cloud characteristics. Forest inventory data is barely available for Central Kalimantan's forests. In order to sample a high number of field plots the angle count method was applied which allows fast sampling. More laborious fixed-area plots (three nests of circular shape) were used as a control and approved the use of the angle count method. AGB values, calculated by using existing allometric models, were in the range of 15-547 Mg ha-1 depending on forest type, degradation level and the model used for calculation. As expected, logging resulted in significant AGB losses in all forest types. AGB-prediction models were established for each forest type using statistical values of the LiDAR point clouds and the forest inventory plots. These regression models were then applied to six LiDAR tracks (altogether with a size of 5241ha) covering unlogged, logged and burned lowland dipterocarp and peat swamp forest. The regression analysis showed that the 45th and 65th percentiles and the standard error of the mean explain 83% of the variation in lowland dipterocarp forest plots (RMSE = 21.37%). The best model for peat swamp forest could only explain 32% of the AGB variation (RMSE = 41.02%). Taking both forest types together explained 71% (RMSE = 33.85%). Calculating AGB for whole LiDAR tracks demonstrated the ability of this approach to quantify not only deforestation but also especially forest degradation and its spatial variability in terms of biomass change in different forest ecosystems using LiDAR transects. Concluding it can be stated that the combined approach of extensive field sampling and LiDAR point cloud analysis have high potential to significantly improve current estimates of carbon stocks across different forest types and degradation levels and its spatial variation in highly inaccessible tropical rainforests in the framework of REDD.© 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Above ground biomass; forest degradation; Forest inventory; Indonesia; LiDAR; Reduced emissions from deforestation and; Tropical forest","Kronseder, K.; Remote Sensing Solutions GmbH, Grosshaderner Strasse 2, Isarstrasse 3, D-82065 Munich, Germany; email: kronseder@rssgmbh.de",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864510891

In Borneo most of the forests are classified as permanent forest estates and are selectively logged using conventional logging techniques causing high damage to the forest ecosystems. Incorporation of sustainable forest management into climate change mitigation measures such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) can help to avert further forest degradation by synergizing sustainable timber production with the conservation of biodiversity. In order to evaluate the efficiency of such initiatives, monitoring methods for forest degradation and above-ground biomass in tropical forests are urgently needed. In this study we developed an index using Landsat satellite data to describe the crown cover condition of lowland mixed dipterocarp forests. We showed that this index combined with field data can be used to estimate above-ground biomass using a regression model in two permanent forest estates in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Tangkulap represented a conventionally logged forest estate while Deramakot has been managed in accordance with sustainable forestry principles. The results revealed that conventional logging techniques used in Tangkulap during 1991 and 2000 decreased the above-ground biomass by an annual amount of average -6.0 t C/ha (-5.2 to -7.0 t C/ha, 95% confidential interval) whereas the biomass in Deramakot increased by 6.1 t C/ha per year (5.3-7.2 t C/ha, 95% confidential interval) between 2000 and 2007 while under sustainable forest management. This indicates that sustainable forest management with reduced-impact logging helps to protect above-ground biomass. In absolute terms, a conservative amount of 10.5 t C/ha per year, as documented using the methodology developed in this study, can be attributed to the different management systems, which will be of interest when implementing REDD+ that rewards the enhancement of carbon stocks. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Borneo; Forest degradation; Landsat; Remote sensing; Sustainable forest management","Langnera, A.; Bureau of Climate Change, 1 Matsunosato, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8687, Japan; email: andi.langner@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864501554

The species composition of shifting cultivation fallows was distinct from other forest types but logged forests were similar to old growth forests, especially in lowland forests. Disturbance intensity was the most frequently important factor in determining species composition, species density, diversity, and basal area accumulation. Soil nutrient availability explained some of the variation in species composition and diversity. Stem density was related to multiple factors including disturbance history, soil nutrients, and distance to old-growth forest.

Although discussions about restoration strategies often pertain solely to severely degraded tropical forests and invoke only the enrichment planting option, different approaches to restoration are needed to counter the full range of degrees of degradation. We propose approaches for restoration of forests that range from being slightly to severely degraded. Our methods start with ceasing the causes of degradation and letting forests regenerate on their own, progress through active management of natural regeneration in degraded areas to accelerate tree regeneration and growth, and finally include the stage of degradation at which re-planting is necessary. We argue that when the appropriate techniques are employed, forest restoration is cost-effective relative to conventional planting, provides abundant social and ecological co-benefits, and results in the sequestration of substantial amounts of carbon. For forest restoration efforts to succeed, a supportive post-Kyoto agreement is needed as well as appropriate national policies, institutional arrangements, and local participation. © iForest - Biogeosciences and Forestry.","Assisted natural regeneration; Biodiversity; Climate change agreement; Forest restoration; REDD-plus; Reduced-impact logging, Silviculture","Sasaki, N.; Graduate School of Applied Informatics, , 650-0044 Kobe, Japan; email: nop.kankyo@ai.u_hyogo.ac.jp",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861719587

Species of this functional group are expected to occur at lower densities, have lower species richness and diversity, and be smaller in logged forests. To quantify structural and functional differences in tree communities, we sampled 120 randomly placed plots, 60 each in logged and unlogged forest sites. We found significant differences in species richness and diversity between logged and intact forest. Within biotically-dispersed species, bird dispersed species showed a significant reduction in species richness.

The consequences of these changes for the functioning of tropical forest ecosystems have rarely been explored in a comprehensive approach. In a Kenyan rainforest, we studied six animal-mediated ecosystem processes and recorded species richness and community composition of all animal taxa involved in these processes. We used linear models and a formal meta-analysis to test whether forest fragmentation and selective logging affected ecosystem processes and biodiversity and used structural equation models to disentangle direct from biodiversity-related indirect effects of human disturbance on multiple ecosystem processes. Fragmentation increased decomposition and reduced antbird predation, while selective logging consistently increased pollination, seed dispersal and army-ant raiding. Fragmentation modified species richness or community composition of five taxa, whereas selective logging did not affect any component of biodiversity. Changes in the abundance of functionally important species were related to lower predation by antbirds and higher decomposition rates in small forest fragments. The positive effects of selective logging on bee pollination, bird seed dispersal and army-ant raiding were direct, i.e. not related to changes in biodiversity, and were probably due to behavioural changes of these highly mobile animal taxa. We conclude that animal-mediated ecosystem processes respond in distinct ways to different types of human disturbance in Kakamega Forest. Our findings suggest that forest fragmentation affects ecosystem processes indirectly by changes in biodiversity, whereas selective logging influences processes directly by modifying local environmental conditions and resource distributions. The positive to neutral effects of selective logging on ecosystem processes show that the functionality of tropical forests can be maintained in moderately disturbed forest fragments. Conservation concepts for tropical forests should thus include not only remaining pristine forests but also functionally viable forest remnants. © 2011 Schleuning et al.",,"Schleuning, M.; Department of Ecology, , Mainz, Germany; email: matthias.schleuning@senckenberg.de",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-81155134285

We analyzed 250 offspring (nursery reared seedlings) collected after a logging episode from 14 open-pollinated seed trees. These were compared to 367 seedlings from 20 open-pollinated seed trees previously collected from the pre-logging primary forest. The genetic diversity was significantly lower in the post-logging seed cohort. In contrast to the pre-logging population, significant levels of selfing were detected in the post-logging population (tm=0.962, P&lt;0.05). However, correlated matings were reduced and the effective number of pollen donors almost doubled after harvesting (3.8 against 7.2). Logging also reduced pollen immigration into the plot (from 55% to 38%) and we found no significant correlation between the size of the pollen donors and the number of seeds fathered. Inside the plot, pollen dispersal distance was shorter before logging than after (827 and 952m, respectively) and the reproductive pollination neighbor area (Aep) was larger (average of 178ha). The individual and average variance effective population size within families (ranged from 1.80 to 3.21, average of 2.47) was lower than expected in panmictic populations (Ne=4). The results indicate that while logging greatly reduced the levels of genetic diversity after logging, it also increased genetic recombination within the population and constrained crossing among related individuals. The results show that low-density tropical tree species such as H. courbaril, when harvested in moderate levels may be resilient to a reduction in the reproductive population and may maintain similar levels of outcrossing and pollen dispersal after logging. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Gene flow; Jatobá; Pollen dispersal; Reduced impact logging; SSR loci; Tropical trees","Sebbenn, A.M.; Instituto Florestal de São Paulo, C.P. 1322, CEP 01059-970, São Paulo, SP, Brazil; email: alexandresebbenn@yahoo.com.br",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051940699

The rapid conversion of tropical forests for agriculture, timber production and other uses has generated vast, human-dominated landscapes with potentially dire consequences for tropical biodiversity. Today, few truly undisturbed tropical forests exist, whereas those degraded by repeated logging and fires, as well as secondary and plantation forests, are rapidly expanding. Here we provide a global assessment of the impact of disturbance and land conversion on biodiversity in tropical forests using a meta-analysis of 138 studies. We analysed 2,220 pairwise comparisons of biodiversity values in primary forests (with little or no human disturbance) and disturbed forests. We found that biodiversity values were substantially lower in degraded forests, but that this varied considerably by geographic region, taxonomic group, ecological metric and disturbance type. Even after partly accounting for confounding colonization and succession effects due to the composition of surrounding habitats, isolation and time since disturbance, we find that most forms of forest degradation have an overwhelmingly detrimental effect on tropical biodiversity.

We studied the soil seed bank characteristics in relation to the standing vegetation in three Cameroonian forest zones with different disturbance regimes. There was no significant difference between sites in terms of density of the seed bank; the average mean density was 87.6 seeds m-2. But dissimilarities of the floristic compositions between sites were quite high. Overall, seeds came from 43 species including three commercial tree species. Whereas the seedlings emerging from soil samples mostly came from weedy and short-lived pioneer species, climax species predominated in the extant vegetation, leading to a very weak similarity between soil seed flora and the surrounding vegetation: Sorensen's index ranged from 3.5 to 7.6%. Canopy openness could significantly affect the species richness of soil seed stocks but not the seed density. These results show that the soil seed bank contribution to the resilience of mature tropical forests is low. In particular, very few timber tree species could benefit from soil seed stocks for their regeneration. Therefore, the development of enrichment techniques including use of the soil seed bank as a source of tree regeneration in such a context would be irrelevant. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Central african rainforest; Climax species; Forest disturbance; Forest resilience; Pioneer species; Soil seed bank","Daïnou, K.; Laboratory of Tropical and Subtropical Forestry, 2 Passage des Déportés, 5030 Gembloux, Belgium; email: kdainou@ulg.ac.be",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960384622

Timber harvesting provides income to communities and governments and resources to industry but it has also been identified as a potential contributor to deforestation and degradation of tropical forests. In Papua New Guinea (PNG) harvesting is primarily occurring in accessible primary forests however, the fate of these forests under current harvesting practices is poorly understood.In this study we investigated the impacts of selective harvesting on stand structure, growth and dynamics, recovery and degradation, and species diversity. We also assessed the impacts of forest fire after the 1997-98 El Nino on basal area (BA) growth and mortality rates of natural tropical forests in PNG. For this study we used data from 118 (105 in selectively harvested and 13 in un-harvested forest), one-hectare permanent sample plots distributed across the country and measured for over 15years by the PNG Forest Research Institute (PNGFRI). We analysed data from 84 of these plots in harvested forest to examine temporal trends in stand condition following harvesting. Mortality rates were investigated in 10 of the 21 plots in harvested forest that were burned during the 1997-98 El Nino drought with sufficient data for analyses. We tested a model developed in Queensland tropical forests to determine whether or not a critical threshold residual BA existed for the recovery of harvested tropical forests in PNG. Results from a logarithmic regression analysis of the relationship between starting BA (BA at first census) and stand BA increment after selective harvesting showed a positive increase in BA growth (r2=0.74, p&lt;0.05). However, there was no critical threshold in residual BA that determined whether a harvested forest was likely to degrade or recover BA growth after harvesting. Our analyses suggested that the response to harvesting was variable, with the majority of un-burned plots (75%) showing an increase in BA and remainder a decrease. Average BA of selectively-harvested tropical forests was about 17m2ha-1±4.17 (SD). Average annual increment in BA across the 84 un-burned plots was 0.17m2ha-1year-1±0.62 (SD). Thus these forests generally show capacity to recover after selective harvesting even when the residual BA is low. A proportion of the BA increment is made up of non-commercial pioneer species that originate in significant gaps after harvesting. On burned plots, BA is affected by high mortality rates. The fate of these forests will depend on the degree of future harvesting, potential conversion to agriculture and the impact of fire and other disturbances. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Basal area; El nino; Mortality; Permanent sample plot; Shannon-Wiener index; Species diversity","Yosi, C.K.; Department of Forest and Ecosystem Science, 500 Yarra Boulevard, VIC 3121, Australia; email: c.yosi@pgrad.unimelb.edu.au",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960051194

Relevant information on the transitional changes of forested landscapes in the delta is poor compared to other tropical forests such as the Brazilian and Columbian Amazonian forest where numerous research studies have been conducted. Consequently, this study aimed at investigating the spatial extent and rates of forest transition in the Niger Delta region taking into consideration the patterns, causes and implications of the landscape dynamics. The study determined the spatial extent and rates of forest transition in the study area using remotely sensed data from 1986 and 2007. The results indicated that the spatial extent of deforestation, unchanged forest cover and afforestation were 1.38, 2.39, and 1.15 million hectares, respectively, while the annual deforestation and afforestation rates were 0.95 and 0.75% which are high compared to other areas in the humid tropics. The annual rate of change in forest cover was determined as -0.13% indicating an overall reduction in the spatial extent of forest cover for the entire delta. Changes in the spatial structure of forests were investigated using landscape metrics and the results showed there was a substantial increase in forest fragmentation. The variations in population dynamics and poverty indicators between different states of the Niger Delta were unable to explain the observed patterns of forest change. Instead, the authors observed that the main determinants of forest dynamics were the variations in state forest management policies and the influence of the oil and gas industry on the economies of the states. High rates of afforestation were found in states that have limited oil resources and were more economically dependent on forest products, while states with high deforestation rates were found in the main oil-producing parts of the study site. Using the present trend of forest transition dynamics, a 20-year forward simulation was generated using the Markov algorithm. The results concerning forest transition in the study area point to the urgent need for appropriate environmental policy development and implementation for the Niger Delta region. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Afforestation; Classification; Deforestation; Forest transition; Fragmentation; Markov; Niger Delta","Onojeghuo, A.

In the Province of Salta, 26% of the forest were removed between 1977 and 2008. At the end of 2007, just before the No. 26331 Law of Native Forest Protection was voted by the Congress, the highest annual rate of deforestation was registered, reaching a value of 2.1%. Regarding this situation, indigenous people of Eastern Salta along with the ""criollos"" (local small ranchers) appealed to the National Supreme Court of Justice for legal protection. The Court requested the province to elaborate a Cumulative Environmental Effects Assessment (CEEA) regarding the process of logging and deforestation in four departments of Salta Province (San Martín, Rivadavia, Santa Victoria, and Orán). The aim of this work is to present a conceptual framework to conduct a CEEA in eastern Salta and to present the evidences and existing methodologies to characterize the impacts of deforestation. The conceptual framework suggested depends on the quantitative characterization of the changes in the provision level of key ecosystem services as a function of the stress and/or disturbance level (in this case deforestation). Based on the literature and our own data, the effects of deforestation on four key ecosystem services have been assessed: C dynamics, energy balance and greenhouse gases emissions, water dynamics and landscape structure. Deforestation produced emissions of 2000 t of CH 4, 200 t of N 2O, above 20 Gg of C/year, a 1.1 watt/m2 reduction in reflected radiation and 4400 TJ radiative energy emissions caused by deforestation fires, increases in the risk of soil salinization and landscape fragmentation. Considering these aspects of the structure and functioning of the ecosystems provides objective elements to evaluate management alternatives and to elaborate monitoring programmes. To consider such management and monitoring alternatives arises technical challenges but also institutional and political ones.","Carbon gains; Deforestation; Evapotranspiration; Greenhouse gases; Land use change; Landscape fragmentation","Paruelo, M.; Facultad de Agronomía (UBA), Av.

However, the mechanism of how land-use surrounding protected areas affects the dynamics of tiger populations is poorly understood. We developed Panthera Population Persistence (PPP)-an individual-based model-to investigate the potential mechanism of the Sumatran tiger population dynamics in a protected area and under different land-use scenarios surrounding the reserve. We tested three main landscape compositions (single, combined and real land-uses of Tesso-Nilo National Park and its surrounding area) on the probability of and time to extinction of the Sumatran tiger over 20 years in Central Sumatra. The model successfully explains the mechanisms behind the population response of tigers under different habitat landscape compositions. Feeding and mating behaviours of tigers are key factors, which determined population persistence in a heterogeneous landscape. All single land-use scenarios resulted in tiger extinction but had a different probability of extinction within 20 years. If tropical forest was combined with other land-use types, the probability of extinction was smaller. The presence of agroforesty and logging concessions adjacent to protected areas encouraged the survival of tiger populations. However, with the real land-use scenario of Tesso-Nilo National Park, tigers could not survive for more than 10 years. Promoting the practice of agroforestry systems surrounding the park is probably the most reasonable way to steer land-use surrounding the Tesso-Nilo National Park to support tiger conservation. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Central Sumatra; Ecological modelling; Human-wildlife conflict; Landscape ecology; Predator-prey relationship; Viability analysis","Imron, M.A.; Wildlife Ecology and Management, Jl.

The objective of this study was to test hypotheses on the distribution of important timber species in relation to topographic position and soil chemical parameters. Tree species from a Central African rain forest were selected within a 100-ha plot in southwestern Central Africa Republic. Individuals of Lovoa trichilioides, Nesogordonia papaverifera, Pterocarpus soyauxii, Terminalia superba ≥ 10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were inventoried then mapped to topography using a survey laser. A torus translation was performed to test for associations between tree species distribution and topographic position as well as soil mineral nutrients for three of the four species. Trees ≥ 30 cm dbh of all three species showed no association with topographic position. However, the distribution of T. superba was significantly associated with high concentrations of soil mineral nutrients. Evidence from mineral nutrient levels indicates that extrapolating topography to define habitat and soil type can be very misleading. Because many of Central Africa's most important timber species have distributions linked to edaphic factors, it is clear that soils must be considered equally as much as topographic position for management plans of logging concessions within Central African tropical forests. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Camerooon; Central african republic; Congo; Lovoa trichilioides; Nesogordonia papaverifera; Pterocarpus soyauxii; Soil mineral nutrients; Terminalia superba; Topographic position; Tree species distribution; Tropical rain forests","Ashton, M.

The entangled nature of these disturbances complicates our ability to resolve applied questions, such as whether secondary and degraded forest can sustain populations of tropical animals. With the expansion of logging in central Africa, conservation depends on knowledge of the individual and combined impacts of logging and hunting on animal populations. Our goals were (1) to decouple the effects of selective logging and hunting on densities of animal guilds, including apes, duikers, monkeys, elephant, pigs, squirrels, and large frugivorous and insectivorous birds and (2) to compare the relative importance of these disturbances to the effects of local-scale variation in forest structure and fruit abundance. In northern Republic of Congo, we surveyed animals along 30 transects positioned in forest disturbed by logging and hunting, logging alone, and neither logging nor hunting. While sampling transects twice per month for two years, we observed 47 179 animals of 19 species and eight guilds in 1154 passages (2861 km). Species densities varied by as much as 480% among forest areas perturbed by logging and/or hunting, demonstrating the strong effects of these disturbances on populations of some species. Densities of animal guilds varied more strongly with disturbance type than with variation in forest structure, canopy cover, and fruit abundance. Independently, logging and hunting decreased density of some guilds and increased density of others: densities varied from 44% lower (pigs) to 90% higher (insectivorous birds) between logged and unlogged forest and from 61% lower (apes) to 77% higher (frugivorous birds) between hunted and unhunted forest. Their combined impacts exacerbated decreases in populations of some guilds (ape, duiker, monkey, and pig), but counteracted one another for others (squirrels, insectivorous and frugivorous birds). Together, logging and hunting shifted the relative abundance of the animal community away from large mammals toward squirrels and birds. Logged forest, even in the absence of hunting, does not maintain similar densities as unlogged forest for most animal guilds. To balance conservation with the need for economic development and wild meat in tropical countries, landscapes should be spatially managed to include protected areas, community hunting zones, and production forest. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","Animal community; Animal density; Congo; Guilds; Habitat variables; Hunting; Logging; Transects; Tropical forest; Zero-inflated poisson","Poulsen, J.R.; Woods Hole Research Center, 149 Woods Hole Road, Falmouth, MA 02540-1644, United States; email: jpoulsen@whrc.org",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960375674

We investigated how hunting offtake of vertebrates differed in mixed forest and monodominant forest (composed of Gilbertiodendron dewevrei) and over different spatial extents within the hunting catchment around the logging town of Kabo, Congo. In 9 months of recall surveys with hunters, we gathered information on over 1500 hunting trips in which ungulates were 65% of the species killed and 82% of harvested biomass. Hunters supplied information on animals killed and the hunting trip, including the area visited (i.e., hunting zone; 11 separate zones within a 506 km2 catchment or commonly hunted area). Over 65% of all animals were killed in monodominant forest, which made up 28% of the hunting catchment, and zones with small amounts of monodominant forest were used most frequently by hunters. Given the large offtakes from monodominant forests, we suggest that animal dispersal may be maintaining high, localized harvests in these areas. We believe hunters preferred to hunt in monodominant forest because the understory was accessible and that areas with small amounts of monodominant forest and large amounts of mixed forest were more productive. The variation in hunting pressure we found between and within hunting zones differs from past examinations of spatial variation in hunting offtake, where entire hunting catchments were considered population sinks and areas with low to no hunting (no-take zones) were outside hunting catchments. Future use of no-take zones to manage hunting should incorporate variability in offtake within hunting catchments.©2011 Society for Conservation Biology.","Central Africa; Congo; Duiker; Hunting; Source-sink; Ungulate","Mockrin, M.H.; Rocky Mountain Research Station, 2150 Centre Ave Bldg A, Fort Collins, CO 80526, United States; email: mmockrin@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955848208

We explore allocation of logging rights using a case study from Loreto, Peruvian Amazonia, where millions of hectares of tropical rainforest were offered for concession in a competitive tendering process that addressed issues related to locality. Methodology/Principal Findings: After briefly presenting the study area and the tendering process, we identify and define local and non-local actors taking part in the concession process. We then analyse their tenders, results of the tendering, and attributes of the concession areas. Our results show that there was more offer than demand for concession land in the tendering. The number of tenders the concession areas received was related to their size and geographic location in relation to the major cities, but not to their estimated timber volumes or median distances from transport routes. Small and Loreto-based actors offered lower yearly area-based fees compared to larger ones, but the offers did not significantly affect the results of the tenders. Local experience in the form of logging history or residence near the solicited concession areas, as well as being registered in the region of Loreto, improved the success of the tenders. Conclusions/Significance: The allocation process left a considerable number of forest areas under the management of small and local actors, and if Peru is to reach its goal of zero deforestation rate by safeguarding 75 per cent of its forests by 2020, the small and the local actors need to be integrated to the forest regime as important constituents of its legitimacy. © 2011 Salo et al.",,"Salo, M.; Department of Biology, , Turku, Finland; email: mattsal@utu.fi",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955894344

The relative contribution of environmental factors and dispersal limitation in determining the spatial distribution of saplings at local scale is unclear. Methods: We examined two types of environmental factors: (a) soil type reflecting drainage regime and (b) past logging damages reflecting light regime in a neotropical moist forest site. We used a logistic model to predict presence or absence of a given species in a network of elementary small plots. Results: The effect of mapped environmental factors and a spatial correlation term were jointly estimated providing a direct measure of the relative role of habitat specialisation and dispersal limitation. At community level, dispersal limitation was the most important determinant of species absence at local scale. The two environmental factors examined played a balanced role. Different species however showed different degrees of dispersal limitation and habitat specialisation. The distribution of a large proportion of species-the majority of the most abundant species-was significantly affected by at least one environmental factor.

Assessments of biodiversity and of conservation species are essential to estimating the conservation value of ecosystems in order to develop appropriate management measures.

Twenty five one hectare plots have been set up using circular sub-plots of 8 metres diameter and at a distance of 10m from the centre point of other sub-plots. The sampling is approximately 50% in each plot. Ten years after the last logging, the species richness appears low, when compared with the close protected area, but the diversity is quite high and conservation species still occur. Twelve conservation species have been studied from the point of view of their distribution and regeneration. Some are close to extinction but some others show promise in terms of regeneration. Six floristic groups have been identified and, among them, two are of interest from a conservation point of view. This logged forest still has a high conservation value, and the process that aims at developing protection measures is clearly relevant. © J.

The article deals with household energy use and the source of firewood (bought or collected, either locally or over some distance) in two semiarid forests in Piura, northern Peru. The most used tree species and the vulnerability of the species are also examined in order to understand deforestation. Peru has introduced regulations on the use of forest resources and the article focuses on how these regulations are locally understood. The methodology includes questionnaires, recording local household practices, and in-depth interviews with local informants and both governmental and non-governmental organizations.

Few quantitative data, however, are available to evaluate the long-term impact of harvesting on chimpanzees and other apes. In particular, few data are available to compare population demographics and/or forest composition before and after timber harvesting at the same site. Utilizing detailed forestry department records of logging operations conducted in the late 1960s, present-day botanical surveys, and long-term data on the feeding ecology of chimpanzees in Kibale National Park (KNP), Uganda, I examined the impact that logging has had on KNP chimpanzee communities of known size and demography. Although some important chimpanzee food resources were harvested in high abundance during commercial logging operations, the overall impact on the most predominant dietary items (those making up roughly 75% of the chimpanzees' diet) and on presumably critical subsistence resources was limited. Furthermore, the low density of chimpanzees inhabiting the logged region of KNP is apparently not attributable to the impact of logging at the site: comparisons of resource densities at this 'low-chimpanzee-density' site with that of an unlogged and 'high-chimpanzee-density' KNP site did not differ when logging concessions at the low-chimpanzee-density site were excluded from the analysis.

We use long-term plot data (17y) to estimate recovery times of separate forest compartments, which experienced different levels of timber extraction within Kibale National Park, Uganda. We estimate that structural recovery (basal area) of heavily logged and moderately logged compartments will take respectively 112 and 95y, when compared to adjacent mature forest. Our data suggests that recovery in terms of species composition will take significantly longer. Our estimates of structural recovery are derived from rates of change of diameter at breast height and basal area measurements which have been used traditionally as indicators of forest growth and productivity. Our results suggest that the severity of the logging has an impact on the rate of recovery, with current recovery rates estimated at 0.32m2ha-1y-1 in a moderately logged compartment and 0.25m2ha-1y-1 in heavily logged areas, highlighting the possible benefits of reduced impact harvesting in increasing long-term yields.

These common types of use caused different kinds of forest disturbances. Plant cover was sampled in 32 quadrats randomly distributed in four stands of logged forest and four stands of secondary vegetation on land previously used for agriculture. A total of 220 species were recorded in 156 genera and 78 families of vascular plants. There were marked differences in the floristic composition, diversity and physiognomy between types of vegetation regenerations. Woody cover, canopy height and canopy cover were significantly higher in the selectively logged TEF than in the secondary vegetation after shifting cultivation, but herbaceous plant cover was comparable between regeneration types. Dominant tree and shrub species were different between regeneration types. The short fallow period for the plots previously used for agriculture resulted in the absence of intermediate regeneration stages, thus, hindering the succession of stands towards floristic composition and structure similar to those of logged TEF.

Such plantations may help to mitigate or reverse the negative impacts of land degradation, and they may contribute to the long-term livelihood of livestock farmers. Planting native trees is, however, perceived as a risky activity due to limited knowledge of their performance and due to marked losses of newly established seedlings attributed to insect pests. Our study focuses on the small-scale effects of environmental heterogeneity, tree diversity and insecticide treatment on the performance of three native Central American timber species two years after establishment, and on damage inflicted by insect herbivores. Growth, survival and herbivore leaf damage were quantified for Anacardium excelsum (Anacardiaceae), Cedrela odorata (Meliaceae) and Tabebuia rosea (Bignoniaceae) planted in an experiment in Panama as (1) monocultures, (2) mixed stands, and (3) mixed stands protected by insecticides. Our study revealed that small-scale effects can have a substantial impact on the success of timber trees planted on former pasture. Growth performance and survival of the three species was strongly affected by small-scale environmental heterogeneity, which was expressed as significant differences in growth and survival among different plantation plots at the same study site. Establishment of trees in mixed stands did not have significant effects on tree survival and growth compared to pure stands, although it reduced herbivore pressure in one of the studied tree species. All tree species grew best and suffered lowest leaf damage when protected by insecticides, indicating a general influence of insect herbivory on growth of newly established trees. In contrast to growth performance, survival was not significantly affected by different management practices or herbivory. The large variability among plots in tree survival and growth, and also in the effects of management practices such as planting design and insecticide treatment, emphasizes the importance of small-scale environmental heterogeneity on tree survival and growth. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Anacardium excelsum; Cedrela odorata; Insect herbivory; Pasture reforestation; Soil characteristics; Tabebuia rosea","Mody, K.; ETH Zurich, Schmelzbergstrasse 9/LFO, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; email: karsten.mody@ipw.agrl.ethz.ch",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651262347

Consequently, the accurate evaluation of impacts of past use and the development of ecologically sound forest management has lagged. To address that gap, we combine matrix model methods with data from interviews with tidal floodplain smallholders regarding land use and ecological knowledge. Here we examine the population dynamics of 8 common tidal floodplain species and explore the link between species population ecology and past, present, and future timber use. Despite the generally high timber stocks due to the dominance of Mora paraensis, these tidal floodplain forests offer challenges to management similar to those seen in tropical forests elsewhere, including low recruitment and species-specific tree growth rates, population densities and size distributions. Furthermore, species population ecology and survey results indicate that the long legacy of forest use in the tidal floodplain forests will influence the future of forest use and management, negatively impacting some species (e.g., Virola surinamensis) while likely benefiting others (e.g., M. paraensis). The observed diameter distributions of species least harvested in the past (e.g., M. paraensis, Licania heteromorpha) follow those derived from stable stage distributions. For other historically harvested species (e.g., Carapa guianensis, V. surinamensis), a larger number of harvest-sized trees for most species would be expected under unlogged conditions, a result corroborated by survey results indicating that maximum log size of long-used timber species has decreased over the past decades. While timber extraction in the Amazon Estuary has endured for centuries, our results suggest long-term timber use does not necessarily entail sustainability; a long history of timber harvesting can also indicate a gradual process of resource depletion as preferred species are sequentially exhausted. If current practices are left unchanged, the prospects for long-term management are likely to decrease further as the densities of preferred high-value species (C. guianensis, V. surinamensis, P. filipes) fall to levels that make management economically unattractive. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Amazônia; Estuary; Population ecology; Várzea","Fortini, L.B.706 W 16th Ave Apt. 215, Gainesville, FL 32601, United States; email: lucasbfortini@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651227095

We used a simulation model, SELVA, to study (1) the relative impact of demographic factors (juvenile mortality, felling regime) and genetic factors (selfing, number and location of fathers, mating success) on long-term genetic diversity; and (2) the impact of different felling regimes on population size versus genetic diversity. Impact was measured by means of model sensitivity analyses. Juvenile mortality had the highest impact on the number of alleles and genotypes, and on the genetic distance between the original and final populations. Selfing had the greatest impact on observed heterozygote frequency and fixation index. Other factors and interactions had only minor effects. Overall, felling had a greater impact on population size than on genetic diversity. Interestingly, populations under relatively low felling pressure even had a somewhat lower fixation index than undisturbed populations (no felling). We conclude that demographic processes such as juvenile mortality should be modelled thoroughly to obtain reliable long-term predictions of genetic diversity. Mortality in selfed and outcrossed progenies should be modelled explicitly by taking inbreeding depression into account. The modelling of selfing based on population rate appeared to be oversimplifying and should account for inter-tree variation.

This approach is still not widely employed, especially with respect to the effects of moderate disturbances. Compensation effects, such as positive interactions among plants, are addressed even more rarely. We attempt to identify the extents to which the distribution of the keystone palm tree Ceroxylon echinulatum is regulated by various regimes of deforestation in a threatened tropical montane cloud forest in the North-West Andes of Ecuador. The demographic structure of this palm tree was examined in three habitats: old-growth forest, forest disturbed by selective logging, and deforested pasture. Patterns were related to stand structure, microclimate, and soil composition. Seedling desiccation owing to severe aboveground water stress led to the absence of juvenile palms in pastures, and thus was predictive of a near extinction of the species in this habitat. However, shade provided by dominant bunchgrass in pastures considerably reduced above- and belowground water stress by diminishing light intensity. Selective logging resulted in a higher density of individuals in disturbed forests than in old-growth forests, but was associated with a spoiled spatial structure. Therefore, the protection of residual old-growth forests is a prerequisite for the conservation of C. echinulatum, although secondary forests might act as provisional refuges that promote its resilience. The reduction of water stress by nurse grasses in pastures represents a promising approach to promote the resilience of tropical tree species and their associated communities after deforestation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Ceroxylon echinulatum; Cloud forest; Deforestation; Ecuador; Facilitation; Selective logging","Anthelme, F.; Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD), 911 Avenue Agropolis, BP 64501, 34394 Montpellier Cedex 5, France; email: fabien.anthelme@ird.fr",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951811534

The study focused on floristic data recently collected by industrial timber companies in the tropical forests of the Central African Republic (28,229 0.5-ha plots spread over 14,000km2). A subset of these plots (n=1107) was later re-sampled for controlling purposes by experienced botanists. The proportion of agreement between the two samplings was assessed for each species and independently for small and large trees, and at genus and family resolutions. Unsurprisingly, large trees and common species were more accurately identified than small trees and rare species. We found that the quality of the floristic determination increased slightly from species to families. We also detected a significant variation between concessions in the quality of the floristic determination that was more dependent on working conditions during forest inventories than on field workers. Contrary to a widespread belief, we did not find a strong bias toward commercial species, showing that commercial inventory data could also be valid for non-commercial species in ecological studies. Finally, we found that both alpha and beta diversity patterns in commercial inventories were highly consistent with those of the re-sampled inventory. This latter result shows that commercial inventories are well suited to detect large-scale patterns of floristic variation. Large-scale commercial inventories could thus play an important role in the identification of large-scale patterns in tropical tree diversity. This could enhance our ability to manage tropical forests by designing representative reserve networks and developing management plans that integrate diversity patterns at the landscape scale. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Central Africa; Communities; Large spatial scale; Tropical forest","Réjou-Méchain, M.; Laboratoire Evolution et Diversité Biologique, , Toulouse, France; email: maxime.rejou@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649447582

However, almost all countries have adopted some form of selective felling system to sustainably manage their forests. In the Philippines, selective logging systems have been adopted. Similarly in Indonesia, a selective cutting system was approved for implementation in 1972 which was revised and modified in 1989. The modified system is called selective felling and replanting system. In Malaysia the selective management system was introduced in 1978 replacing the successful Malayan Uniform System which was practised in lowland dipterocarp forests. The selective systems are generally designed for shorter cutting cycles ranging from 25 to 35 years. Under this system a pre-felling inventory is conducted to determine the cutting limit of trees to be felled. Immediately after harvesting a post-felling inventory is undertaken to determine the quality and composition of the residual stand followed by silvicultural treatment to enhance the residual stand as the future crop for the subsequent cycle. © 2011, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Annual allowable cut; Dipterocarp; Forest inventory; Growing stock; Residual; Selective Management System; Silviculture; Tree marking","Shaharuddin, M.I.; Institute for Environment and Development (LESTARI), Malaysia; email: dinshah@ukm.my",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031715636

Vertebrates are much less diverse, but dominate some key ecological roles. Almost all plants in tropical lowland forests are pollinated by animals, with bees, followed by beetles and flies, most important. Most seeds are also dispersed by animals, except in the upper canopy, with birds, fruit bats, primates, and a variety of terrestrial mammals most important. Maximum routine movement distances for both pollen and seeds are most often in the range 100–1000 m. Seeds are predated before dispersal by colobine monkeys, squirrels, birds, and insects and after dispersal by rodents, birds, ants, and other insects. After germination, the dominant herbivores are insects, and insects also dominate the consumption of dead plant material. Carnivorous animals have indirect impacts on plants through their effects on the abundances and behaviors of other animals. Few forest animals survive deforestation, while hunting is the major threat to vertebrates in intact and logged forests. Failures of seed dispersal are currently the most obvious impacts of animal losses, but more subtle impacts would be easily overlooked. Restoration of seed dispersal services is potentially one of the most effective ways of enhancing forest recovery after logging and increasing resilience to climate change. © 2011, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Conservation; Decomposition; Empty forests; Gene flow; Herbivory; Pollination; Seed dispersal; Seed predation","Corlett, R.T.; Department of Biological Sciences, Singapore; email: corlett@nus.edu.sg",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017593496

This country has an annual deforestation rate of 1.1 to 2.9% which is the highest in Africa. Most Ivorian forests consist of protected areas and of forest fragments embedded in a secondary landscape composed of a mosaic of cultivated fields, fallows and perennial crops plantations. Southwestern Côte d'Ivoire which is our study area, is one of the rare areas where we can still find significant continuous forests blocks (classified forests of Goin-Débé and Cavally, and Taï National Park). This part of Ivorian forest is rich in narrow endemic species (so-called Sassandriennes species) and is one of the hotspots of biodiversity. Considering the floristic characteristics of the study area, the human pressure which also extends to protected areas, and the disastrous consequences on the biodiversity, it becomes a critical issue to assess the impact of forest fragmentation on floristic composition and diversity. Results of this study indicate that impact of isolation and further direct human disturbances on forest fragments lead to an increase of secondary and pioneers strategies and liana life forms.

The regeneration of light-demanding timber species may therefore benefit from more intensive logging, or from post-harvest treatments such as thinning by poison girdling that increases light penetration. Little is known of the impact of post-harvest treatments on the floristic composition of tropical moist forests. This study therefore aimed to assess the effects of low and high selective logging (≃2.33 and 4.73 trees harvested ha-1, and ≃4.96 and 9.16m2ha-1 of basal area removed (logging+damage), respectively) - followed or not by thinning (≃21.14 trees thinned ha-1, and ≃6.57m2ha-1 of basal area removed) - on the floristic composition of a tropical moist forest in the Central African Republic, from 7 to 23 years after logging.We analyzed abundance data for 110 tree genera recorded every year for 14 years in 25 one-hectare permanent subplots. We used multivariate analysis to detect floristic variations between treatments and we assessed changes in floristic composition throughout the period. We compared floristic composition recovery between thinned and unthinned subplots, using unlogged subplots as a reference characterizing the pre-logging floristic composition.Logging and thinning had little impact on the floristic composition of the subplots as quantified 7 to 23 years later, though they did increase the proportion of pioneer species. Surprisingly, additional thinning at both logging levels failed to further distance floristic composition from that of the unlogged subplots, though it did increase disturbance intensity. Floristic composition recovery appeared to be facilitated when thinning was associated with logging. Thinning seemed to favor the growth and survival of non-pioneer species, to the detriment of pioneer species. These non-pioneer species could either be non-pioneer light demanders or shade-bearers. One explanation for this is that thinning by tree-poison girdling increased light availability without causing major damage to the forest, and thus increased the growth and survival of advance regeneration. The resulting enhanced competition then reduced the survival of pioneer species. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Central African Republic; Congo Basin; Floristic composition; Selective logging; Thinning; Tropical forest management","Ouédraogo, D.-Y.; CIRAD-ES, Campus International de Baillarguet TA C-105/D, 34398 Montpellier Cedex 5, France; email: dakis-yaoba.ouedraogo@cirad.fr",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054993933

The project aims at understanding the relationship between tree species diversity and the functioning of lowland dipterocarp rainforest during restoration following selective logging. The experiment is planned to run for several decades (from seed to adult tree), so here we focus on introducing the project and its experimental design and on assessing initial conditions and the potential for restoration of the structure and functioning of the study system, the Malua Forest Reserve. We estimate residual impacts 22 years after selective logging by comparison with an appropriate neighbouring area of primary forest in Danum Valley of similar conditions. There was no difference in the alpha or beta species diversity of transect plots in the two forest types, probably owing to the selective nature of the logging and potential effects of competitive release. However, despite equal total stem density, forest structure differed as expected with a deficit of large trees and a surfeit of saplings in selectively logged areas. These impacts on structure have the potential to influence ecosystem functioning. In particular, above-ground biomass and carbon pools in selectively logged areas were only 60 per cent of those in the primary forest even after 22 years of recovery. Our results establish the initial conditions for the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment and confirm the potential to accelerate restoration by using enrichment planting of dipterocarps to overcome recruitment limitation. What role dipterocarp diversity plays in restoration only will become clear with long-term results. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Dipterocarpaceae; Ecosystem functioning; Enrichment planting; Sabah biodiversity experiment; Selectively logged forest; Species richness","Hector, A.; Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, , 8057 Zurich, Switzerland; email: andrew.hector@uzh.ch",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054683952

We provide an introduction to the technical aspects of the debt-for-nature swap mechanism, then describe how the program operates on the ground, using the United States-Peru swap as an example. We focus on two case studies that are largely representative of the Tropical Forest Conservation Act's work in Peru: 1) ProNaturaleza's project in the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve, and 2) five distinct projects centered around reducing illegal logging in and around Alto Purús National Park. We explore the range of programs financed through swaps, as well as whether debt-for-nature swap projects meet their goals of strengthening civil society and increasing local capacity. We also discuss the efficacy of debt-for-nature swap monitoring, which tends to privilege fiscal evaluations of area protected over direct conservation outcomes.

Spaceborne SAR withstood comparison with Landsat ETM+ in land cover classification of degraded tropical forest. For measurement of carbon stock and GHG flux per unit land area, the gain-loss method requires both growth rate and removal rate of forest carbon stock. However, the latter has rarely been obtained in tropical forest. For the stock-difference method, permanent sampling plot data can be used to estimate mean carbon stock per unit land area of each forest type. For cyclic land use that includes a clear-cutting stage such as slash-and-burn agriculture, chronosequential changes in carbon stock can be predicted by determining the time and spatial-distribution of cleared land. Changes in forest biomass by logging, storm-damage, etc., may be identified by monitoring the presence and diameter of the crowns of overstory trees. We developed five equations containing the parameter for crown diameter for estimating tree biomass. Overstory height can be a parameter for estimating ecosystem carbon stock of various plant communities, and forest height can be measured by airborne and spaceborne sensors, etc. Generic equations containing the parameter for overstory height are available for estimating community biomass of tropical and subtropical forests. PALSAR has an advantage over other remote systems by enabling frequent sensing and semidirect biomass estimation using backscattering coefficients. However, no reasonable remote sensing methods exist for monitoring the amount of carbon loss by forest conversion and logging in forests with high biomass. To compensate for the faults of the present PALSAR methodologies and to enable practical and frequent monitoring of all types of forests by humans, it is vital to devise a new methodology to detect changes in high-biomass forests.","Biomass; Carbon; Forest degradation; Forestry and forest products; PALSAR; REDD","Kiyono, Y.; Department of Plant Ecology, , Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8687, Japan; email: kiono@affrc.go.jp",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960592350

The forested states of West Africa have experienced much recent human conflict but there have been no assessments of impacts on the wildlife. We conducted surveys of mammals in the 710-km2 Gola Forest reserves to assess the impact of the 1991-2001 civil war in Sierra Leone. Gola is the most important remaining tract of lowland forest in the country and a key site for the conservation of the highly threatened forests of the Upper Guinea region. We found that Gola has survived well despite being in the heart of the area occupied by the rebels. We recorded 44 species of larger mammal, including 18 threatened, near-threatened and endemic species, accounting for all species recorded in pre-war surveys and adding several more (African buffalo Syncerus caffer nanus and water chevrotain Hyemoschus aquaticus). Populations of primates were healthy with little evidence of decline. Duiker detection rates were low and further work is required to confirm their numbers as they include five species endemic (or near endemic) to the Upper Guinea region, three of which are threatened. However, the population of African forest elephants Loxodonta cyclotis has collapsed, with only a few individuals remaining from c. 110 in the mid 1980s.

Selective logging has various consequences for natural regeneration, both on the short and the long term. In this study, the recruit abundance and spatial distribution of nine exploited tree species was determined, and compared between a logged and an undisturbed forest area in the Bolivian Amazon. The recruit abundance and spatial distribution was evaluated in 55 nested plots (20 × 20m, 10 × 10m) within 180 ha of forest, in each of the two study sites. Within the 10 × 10 m plots, seedlings, saplings and pole-sized trees were searched, measured and located. In the 20 × 20 m plots, reproductive individuals of >20 cm Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) were included. In the exploited forest, total abundance of C. racemosa, T. altissima and A. lecointei was higher than in the undisturbed forests. In some of the categories recruits of P. corymbosum were more abundant in the exploited forest, while the reverse was found for certain size categories of C. racemosa, T. altissima, D. odorata and C. odorata. The recruit abundance of A. lecointei, P. heterophylla and Virola sp. did not differ between forest sites. As for the spatial distribution, only A. lecointei and Virola sp. showed differences patterns between forest sites. These results suggest that selective logging, as applied at the study site, did not strongly change abundance and spatial distribution of exploited tree species. Probably, low intensity of selective logging does not hamper natural regeneration of exploited tree species.","Bolivia; Natural regeneration; Selective logging; Spatial distribution; Tropical forest","Gómez, J.

Dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) provide an ideal focal guild for such studies. We compared dung beetle assemblages and experimentally assessed rates of dung removal and seed burial in undisturbed forest, low-intensity selectively logged forest under sustainable forest management, and high-intensity logged forest, not under sustainable management in Malaysian Borneo. In total, 7923 individuals from 39 species of dung beetle were collected. There were no significant differences in abundance, biomass or diversity across sites. Species richness was significantly lower in the high-intensity logged sites. Beta diversity was low: of 35 species recorded in undisturbed forest sites, 32 were also captured in low-intensity sites and 29 in high-intensity sites. The environmental and vegetation variables measured had little influence on species composition. An average of 63-99% of dung was removed over 24. h. Mean dung and seed removal were significantly lower in the high-intensity logged sites. Dung removal rates were significantly and positively correlated with dung beetle species richness, but not with dung beetle biomass or abundance. However, the biomass of large-bodied, nocturnal dung beetles was positively correlated with dung removal. In contrast to previous studies, dung beetle biomass and abundance were not correlated with species richness, indicative of density compensation. Overall, dung beetle communities and associated ecosystem functions were robust to low-intensity but not high-intensity selective logging. These differences may be related to changes in the abundance and biomass of particular dung beetle species or guilds rather than community-wide measures of abundance and biomass, highlighting the need to move beyond simplistic biodiversity-ecosystem functioning correlations to understand the functional consequences of habitat modification in high-diversity ecosystems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning; Dung removal; Forest management; Scarabaeinae; Seed dispersal","Slade, E.M.; Department of Zoology, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PS, United Kingdom; email: eleanor.slade@zoo.ox.ac.uk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78751567924

Over the past 32. years, Amazonian forest fragments ranging from 1 to 100. ha have experienced a wide array of ecological changes. Edge effects have been a dominant driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage, fauna, and other aspects of fragment ecology. However, edge-effect intensity varies markedly in space and time, and is influenced by factors such as edge age, the number of nearby edges, and the adjoining matrix of modified vegetation surrounding fragments. In our study area, the matrix has changed markedly over the course of the study (evolving from large cattle pastures to mosaics of abandoned pasture and regrowth forest) and this in turn has strongly influenced fragment dynamics and faunal persistence. Rare weather events, especially windstorms and droughts, have further altered fragment ecology. In general, populations and communities of species in fragments are hyperdynamic relative to nearby intact forest. Some edge and fragment-isolation effects have declined with a partial recovery of secondary forests around fragments, but other changes, such as altered patterns of tree recruitment, are ongoing. Fragments are highly sensitive to external vicissitudes, and even small changes in local land-management practices may drive fragmented ecosystems in markedly different directions. The effects of fragmentation are likely to interact synergistically with other anthropogenic threats such as logging, hunting, and especially fire, creating an even greater peril for the Amazonian biota. © 2010.","Amazon; Community dynamics; Ecosystem processes; Edge effects; Habitat fragmentation; Long-term research; Matrix effects; Species extinctions; Tropical forests","Laurance, W.F.; School of Marine and Tropical Biology, , Cairns, QLD 4870, Australia; email: bill.laurance@jcu.edu.au",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-78751567828

We are able to determine the candidate species of wood samples, based on DNA sequences and anatomical data. The methods for analyzing DNA from dipterocarp wood products may have strong deterrent effects on international trade of illegitimate dipterocarp products. However, the method for analyzing DNA from wood is not perfect for all wood products and need for more improvement, especially for plywood sample. Consequently, there may be benefits for the conservation of tropical forests in Southeast Asia. © 2010 The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer.","Conservation; cpDNA; Database; Illegal logging; Southeast Asia; Tropical forest","Tsumura, Y.; Department of Forest Genetics, , Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8687, Japan; email: ytsumu@ffpri.affrc.go.jp",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650515694

We examined the effects of climate, soil and logging disturbances on diameter growth rates at the tree and stand level, using 165 1-ha permanent sample plots distributed across Bolivian tropical lowland forests. We predicted that growth rates would be higher in humid than in dry forests, higher in nutrient-rich than nutrient-poor forests and higher in logged than non-logged forests. Across the 165 plots we found positive basal area increases at the stand level, which agree with the generally reported biomass increases in tropical forests. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that climate variables, in particular water availability, were the strongest drivers of tree growth. More rainfall, a shorter and less intense dry period and higher temperatures led to higher tree growth rates. Tree growth increased modestly with soil fertility and basal area growth was greatest at intermediate soil fertility. Surprisingly, tree growth showed little or no relationship with total soil nitrogen or plant available soil phosphorus. Growth rates increased in logged plots just after logging, but this effect disappeared after 6 years. Synthesis. Climate is the strongest driver of spatial variation in tree growth, and climate change may therefore have large consequences for forest productivity and carbon sequestration. The negative impact of decreased rainfall and increased rainfall seasonality on tree growth might be partly offset by the positive impact of increased temperature in these forests. © 2010 The Authors.

In this study we analyse the population structure, tree age and wood increment of Malouetia tamaquarina (Aubl.) (Apocynaceae) to define a species-specific minimum logging diameter (MLD) and felling cycle by modelling volume growth. Contrary to other timber species in the nutrient-rich white-water floodplains forests (várzea), M. tamaquarina grows in the subcanopy of old-growth várzea forests. The wood of this species is utilized by local inhabitants in the floodplains for handicraft. In 35 plots of 25m×50m we measured diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height of all trees taller than 150cm height. From 37 individuals with DBH&gt;15cm we sampled two cores by increment borers to determine the wood density, tree age and diameter increment rates. In the management area of a várzea settlement with about 150ha recently harvested trees of M. tamaquarina have been recorded and DBH was measured. The species presents an inverse J-shaped diameter distribution indicating that the species is obviously regenerating in the old-growth forests. Tree-ring analysis indicates a mean age of 74.5 years for a DBH of 22.7cm for a studied population comprising 37 trees with maximum ages of up to 141 years for an individual with a DBH of 45.7cm. The tree species has low annual diameter increment rates (3.16±0.6mm) despite a low wood density (0.36±0.05gcm-3). The volume growth model indicates a MLD of 25cm and a felling cycle of 32.4 years. In the management area 35 trees with a mean DBH of 24cm were recorded, similar to the defined MLD. The abundance of trees above the MLD is 2.7treesha-1, or 405 trees, when extrapolated to the whole management area. Considering a felling cycle of 32.4 years (annual production unit of 4.63ha) this results in total of 12.5 harvestable trees, almost three times less than actually harvested. The actual practice of harvesting M. tamaquarina risks the overexploitation of this slow-growing species. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Felling cycle; Growth model; Minimum logging diameter; Silviculture; Tree-ring analysis; Tropical floodplain forest","Leoni, J.M.; INPA/Max-Planck Project, Av.

Deforestation results in carbon emissions when trees and underlying vegetation are burning or decomposing. Deforested areas that are later cultivated also release carbon to the atmosphere when soil carbon is oxidized. Further, deforested areas converted to other land uses (e.g., pastures) might sequester less carbon than forests, enabling greater levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. Providing incentives to prevent deforestation in foreign countries has been proposed in climate change legislation. An objective of this legislation is to provide funding from carbon markets to assist foreign countries in reducing deforestation and increasing forest restoration and afforestation. Challenges to this approach include implementing deforestation reduction activities in developing countries that may lack the capacity to monitor and enforce measures, avoiding harm to indigenous communities who rely on forest resources, and matching policies with the various drivers of deforestation in different regions around the world. Legislative policies on deforestation and climate change are analyzed in this report, and challenges for restoring forests in the tropics are discussed. Deforestation1 is responsible for the largest share of additional carbon dioxide (CO2) released to the atmosphere due to land use changes, approximately 20% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually.2 Deforestation results in carbon emissions when trees and underlying vegetation are burning or decomposing. Deforested areas that are later cultivated also release carbon to the atmosphere when soil carbon is oxidized. Further, deforested areas converted to other land uses (e.g., pastures) might sequester less carbon than forests, enabling greater levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. Forests store approximately 45% of terrestrial carbon, and in the 1990s were estimated to remove 2.6 billion tons of carbon (mtCO2) from the atmosphere per year; this sequestered amount is equivalent to approximately 33% of anthropogenic carbon emissions from fossil fuel and land use changes.3 Data on carbon sequestration and emissions are not available for many regions, making global estimates uncertain. Much of the deforestation responsible for CO2 releases occurs in tropical regions, specifically in developing countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Tropical forests store approximately 25% of the total global terrestrial carbon. Scientists estimate that tropical deforestation and other land use changes may have been responsible for releasing approximately 1.5 billion metric tons of CO2 per year to the atmosphere during the 1990s, and may be contributing similar amounts of carbon to the atmosphere today.4 Some contend that deforestation due to logging might result in small carbon emissions because timber converted into products will not release CO2 immediately. Others disagree, stating that the percentage of wood transformed into wood products is probably small in tropical and temperate regions. Deforestation rates vary across the world, yet are generally higher in tropical regions (see Figure 1). By continent, the highest rate of net forest loss is in South America, which lost approximately 4.3 million hectares (ha) of its forest (0.5%) annually from 2000 to 2005. This is followed by Africa, which lost approximately 4.0 million ha (0.6%) of its forest annually during the same period. North America (including Central America), in contrast, lost approximately 333,000 ha (0.05%) annually from 2000-2005; and in China, there was a reported gain of 4.1 million ha of forest annually (2.2%) during the same period, primarily due to large-scale afforestation efforts.5 © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Some of these efforts center onreducing CO2 emissions from deforestation, since deforestation releases about17% of all annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is seenas a relatively low-cost target for emissions reduction. Policies aimed atreducing deforestation are central points of a strategy to decrease carbonemissions, reflected in pending legislation in Congress (e.g., H.R. 2454 and S.1733) as well as in international discussions, such as the December 2009negotiations in Copenhagen.Forests exist at many latitudes. Many are concerned about the possibleimpacts of losing boreal and temperate forests, but existing data show little, ifany, net deforestation, and their loss has relatively modest carbonconsequences. In contrast, tropical deforestation is substantial and continuing,and releases large amounts of CO2, because of the carbon stored in thevegetation and released when tropical forests are cut down.There are many causes of tropical deforestation-commercial logging,large-scale agriculture (e.g., cattle ranching, soybean production, oil palmplantations), small-scale permanent or shifting (slash-and-burn) agriculture,fuelwood removal, and more. Often, these causes combine to exacerbatedeforestation; for example, commercial logging often includes roadconstruction, which in turn opens the forest for subsistence farmers. At times,tropical deforestation results from weak land tenure and/or weak or corruptgovernance to protect the forests.Congress and international bodies are discussing various policies toreduce carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD).Reducing deforestation in the tropics is likely to have additional benefits aswell, such as preserving biological diversity and sustaining livelihoods for therural poor and for indigenous communities and cultures. Proposals may beadapted to address local and regional causes of deforestation. Various forestrypractices can reduce the impacts of deforestation, and several marketapproaches are evolving to compensate landowners for preserving theirforests.Many challenges remain for implementing REDD programs, particularlyinternationally, including monitoring REDD projects and improvingdeveloping-country capacity to ensure compliance. Existing evidence onforests and deforestation suggest the difficulties might be significant.Measuring forests is complicated, with multiple definitions, inaccessible sites,and expensive, complicated, and imperfect measurement technologies.This chapter provides basic information on forests and climate change.The first section discusses the linkages between forests and climate. The nextthree describe the characteristics of the three major forest biomes, with anoverview of deforestation causes and impacts. This is followed by an overviewof approaches to reducing deforestation. The final section examines issuesrelated to forest and deforestation data.Global climate change is a widespread and growing concern that has led toextensive Gcongressional and international discussions and negotiations.Climate change mitigation strategies have focused on reducing emissions ofgreenhouse gases (GHGs), especially carbon dioxide (CO2). One significantsource of CO2 emissions is deforestation. Reducing deforestation to lower CO2 emissions is seen as one of the least costly methods of mitigating climatechange.1 Forests are carbon sinks in their natural state (i.e., they store more carbonthan they release). Trees absorb CO2 and convert carbon into leaves, stems,and roots, while releasing oxygen. Forests account for more than a quarter ofthe land area of the earth, and store more than three-quarters of the carbon interrestrial plants and nearly 40% of soil carbon. When forests are cleared,some of their carbon is released to the atmosphere-slowly through decay orquickly through burning. One estimate shows that land use change, primarilydeforestation, releases about 5.9 GtCO2 (gigatons or billion metric tons ofCO2) annually, about 17% of all annual anthropogenic GHG emissions.2 Thiscontribution to GHG emissions makes efforts to reduce deforestationsignificant in international strategies to mitigate climate change.There has also been some discussion of the relationship between forestsand methane (CH4), a less prominent but far more potent GHG than CO2.However, the evidence of the relationship is still limited. It generally showsforests to be net CH4 sinks, except in water-saturated soils (i.e., forestedwetlands), and it is unclear whether activities that modify forest cover (e.g.,deforestation) affect CH4 absorption and release.3 Thus, this chapter addressesonly the relationship between forests and carbon as it affects climate change.The loss of tropical forests is of particular concern. The existing data showlittle, if any, net deforestation in boreal and temperate forests, and thus thecarbon consequences of deforestation in these ecosystems might not besignificant. In contrast, the loss of tropical forests is substantial andcontinuing. Tropical deforestation has significant climate impacts because ofthe large amount of CO2 sequestered in the vegetation-nearly half of all thecarbon in terrestrial plants. Thus, the lowest cost and largest carbon benefit ofreducing deforestation is with tropical forests. In the United States, tropicalforests are largely limited to Hawaii and Puerto Rico. ©2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Timber industry and agriculture activities are threatening the integrity and functionality of the Amazon forest. The ecological sustainability of forest management practices must include criteria and indicators for genetic variability maintenance and its correlated processes. Habitat fragmentation reduces continuous forest lands to small isolated areas, thus reducing the effective number of trees, the number of pollen donors, and the amount of compatible pollen deposited on the flowers pistils. This may lead to low fruit set. A decline on the pollinators' population, increase on inbreeding and changes on the pollinator species composition is also expected. In order to guarantee the forest management sustainability, including the upholding of genetic diversity in managed forests, it is essential to contemplate information on the reproductive biology of the target species.

Ecosystem pools of P, and of simultaneously quantified nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) were 3.4, 12 and 370 Mg ha-1, respectively. Only 2.6% of the total ecosystem P was in the above-ground vegetation, contrasting to C (60%) and N (16%).

Soil P primarily consisted of recalcitrant occluded fractions (78-91%) and only 4% was labile. Approximately three-quarters of labile soil P was an organic fraction (Po). The concentration of labile Po did not differ between soil horizons, while both phosphatase activity and fine-root density were the greatest in the topsoil (top 5 cm) and dramatically decreased with depth. This suggests that trees depend on the acquisition of P from the labile Po in the topsoil, despite a greater amount of labile P in the subsoil. Trees with a high foliar N/P ratio may invest N to acquire P from the topsoil by secreting phosphatase that consists of proteins, rather than investing C to extending roots to scavenge P in the subsoil. © 2010 Cambridge University Press.","acid phosphatase activity; coarse woody debris; nutrient limitation; selective logging; soil phosphorus fractionation","Imai, N.; Graduate School of Agriculture, Oiwake-cho, Kitashirakawa, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan; email: inobuo@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79251627386

An initial niche model was constructed to describe elephant niche structure, and a second model focused on identifying core areas only. To assess the threat of habitat encroachment, overlap between the elephants' optimal niche and the occurrence of forest encroachment is computed.Results Elephants were recorded throughout the study area from sea level to 1600 m a.s.l. The results show that the elephant niche and consequently habitat use markedly deviates from the available environment. Elephant presence was positively related to forest cover and vegetation productivity, and elephants were largely confined to valleys. A spatially explicit model showed that elephants mainly utilize forest edges. Forest encroachment occurs throughout the elephants range and was found within 80% of the elephants' ecological niche.Main conclusions In contrast to general opinion, elephant distribution proved to be weakly constrained by altitude, possibly because of movement routes running through mountainous areas. Elephants were often found to occupy habitat patches in and near human-dominated areas. This pattern is believed to reflect the displacement of elephants from their former habitat. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Distribution; Disturbance; Ecological niche; ENFA; Habitat; Marginality; Specialization","Rood, E.; Department of Anthropology and Geography, , Gipsy Lane, Oxford OX3 0BP, United Kingdom; email: enterood@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958577250

Although the greatest diversity of cavity-nesting birds is found in tropical and subtropical moist forests, little is known about how tropical logging affects the abundance of cavities or cavity-nesting birds. We compared the abundance of cavities and cavity nests between primary and selectively-logged subtropical moist Atlantic forest in Argentina, and conducted the first before-after controlled nest-box addition experiment to determine whether nest sites limit the breeding density of cavity-nesting birds in tropical or subtropical moist forest. Visual inspection of 86 cavities identified through ground-surveys revealed that only 19% were suitable for nesting birds, suggesting that cavity abundance may be overestimated in the literature on tropical forests. Suitable cavities were found in fewer than 1% of 1156 trees <60. cm. dbh but 20% of 20 trees >100. cm. dbh. Logged forest had half the basal area of primary forest, one third the density of large trees, nine times fewer cavities suitable for nesting birds, and 17 times fewer active nests. When we added nest boxes, nesting density increased on treatment plots but not on control plots in both logged and primary forest, suggesting that cavity supply can limit nest density even in relatively undisturbed forest. This is the first experiment to show how reduced cavity supply in logged tropical forest can limit breeding density of cavity-nesting birds. International initiatives such as forest certification should promote tropical timber management strategies that conserve large live cavity-bearing trees. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Cavity-nesting bird; Logging; Neotropical; Resource limitation; Resource supplementation; Tree-hole","Cockle, K.L.; Center for Applied Conservation Research, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z4, Canada; email: kristinacockle@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956882112

Road building is essential to the extraction of multiple-use forest resources; hence, roads must be designed to satisfy a whole range of needs. However, careless logging and road building have been the main causes for environmental degradation in many forest regions. The aim of this study is to optimize the forest road network so that it is aligned based on results of the determination of the Net Production Area (NPA) and the identification of harvestable trees, while being constrained by information on soil loss prediction and hydrological flow direction. In optimizing the road routing, there are several matters that have to be considered, namely that the road should be: (1) as near as possible to clusters of harvestable trees, (2) away from the rivers and their buffers, (3) avoid high erosion risk areas, and (4) avoid relatively steep land. A number of software problems are experienced in implementing this procedure, but the results obtained in this chapter show how the final timber harvesting plan might be constructed for the study area, which is ready to be implemented in the forest. © 2010 IEEE.","Environmental degradation; Forest road; Geographic information system (GIS); Timber harvesting; Tropical forest","Safiah, Y.

There are many important similarities but also key differences in the kinds of work conducted on these four kinds of landscape change in tropical and temperate forests. For example, direct studies of the effects of forest conversion on biodiversity are relatively rare in both tropical and temperate ecosystems. Temperate forest research differs from tropical research in terms of relative amount of single species work, long-term studies, and research at scales spanning multiple landscapes. There are key areas for cross-fertilization of research in tropical and temperate forest biomes. These include: (1) the ability of species to persist in post-disturbed forest landscapes, including those perturbed by past clearing, logging or wildfire, (2) the impacts of plantation establishment on biodiversity, (3) the effectiveness of altered silvicultural systems on forest structure, vegetation composition, and biota, and (4) inter-relationships between forest logging and fire-proneness. Cross-learning about the impacts of drivers of landscape change between tropical and temperate forests is fundamental for speeding the progress of conservation efforts in both broad kinds of environments. However, some opportunities for cross-learning have not been taken because temperate and tropical forest research has often sometimes been isolated from one another.

It leads to loss in soil fertility, water resources and biodiversity, as well as contributes to climate change. Efforts are therefore required to try to minimize further degradation and restore tropical forests in a sustainable way. This is the first research-based book to examine this problem in East Africa. The specific focus is on the forests of Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda, but the lessons learned are shown to be applicable to neighbouring countries and others in the tropics. A wide range of forest types are covered, from dry Miombo forest and afromontane forests, to forest-savannah mosaics and wet forest types. Current management practices are assessed and examples of good practice presented. The role of local people is also emphasized. The authors describe improved management and restoration through silviculture, plantation forestry and agroforestry, leading to improvements in timber production, biodiversity conservation and the livelihoods of local people. © Frans Bongers and Timm Tennigkeit 2010.

We discovered previously unknown variation in carbon storage at multiple scales based on geologic substrate and forest type. From 1999 to 2009, emissions from land use totaled 1.1% of the standing carbon throughout the region.

If new allometric relationships between canopy height and the biomass stored in the vegetation can be established this would offer the possibility for a global monitoring of the above-ground carbon content on land. In the absence of adequate field data we use simulation results of a tropical rain forest growth model to propose what degree of information might be generated from canopy height and thus to enable ground-truthing of potential future satellite observations. We here analyse the correlation between canopy height in a tropical rain forest with other structural characteristics, such as above-ground life biomass (AGB) (and thus carbon content of vegetation) and leaf area index (LAI) and identify how correlation and uncertainty vary for two different spatial scales. The process-based forest growth model FORMIND2.0 was applied to simulate (a) undisturbed forest growth and (b) a wide range of possible disturbance regimes typically for local tree logging conditions for a tropical rain forest site on Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia) in South-East Asia. In both undisturbed and disturbed forests AGB can be expressed as a power-law function of canopy height h (AGB Combining double low line a · hb) with an r2 ∼ 60% if data are analysed in a spatial resolution of 20 m × 20 m (0.04 ha, also called plot size). The correlation coefficient of the regression is becoming significant better in the disturbed forest sites (r2 Combining double low line 91%) if data are analysed hectare wide. There seems to exist no functional dependency between LAI and canopy height, but there is also a linear correlation (r2 ∼ 60%) between AGB and the area fraction of gaps in which the canopy is highly disturbed. A reasonable agreement of our results with observations is obtained from a comparison of the simulations with permanent sampling plot (PSP) data from the same region and with the large-scale forest inventory in Lambir. We conclude that the spaceborne remote sensing techniques such as LIDAR and radar interferometry have the potential to quantify the carbon contained in the vegetation, although this calculation contains due to the heterogeneity of the forest landscape structural uncertainties which restrict future applications to spatial averages of about one hectare in size. The uncertainties in AGB for a given canopy height are here 20-40% (95% confidence level) corresponding to a standard deviation of less than ± 10%. This uncertainty on the 1 ha-scale is much smaller than in the analysis of 0.04 ha-scale data. At this small scale (0.04 ha) AGB can only be calculated out of canopy height with an uncertainty which is at least of the magnitude of the signal itself due to the natural spatial heterogeneity of these forests. © Author(s) 2010.",,"Köhler, P.; Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, P.O.

Land use changes, unsustainable logging and global change are probably the most relevant. Using information from permanent plots periodically monitored in logged and unlogged areas in the Imataca Forest Reserve, Southeastern Venezuela, aboveground carbon storage for both forest conditions was estimated for an eight year period. Although selective logging only concentrates on ∼10% of total aboveground biomass (5.93·m3·ha-1), one year after logging operations the exploited forests had ∼50% less carbon than unlogged areas, which is expressed in a net difference of 81. 43mgC·ha-1 between both areas, suggesting a considerable impact on the remnant forest. Additionally, with an annual rate of 0.55 ±0.61mgC·ha-1·year-1 in logged areas, a total recovery of original carbon stocks is expected after ∼150 years. Results also indicate that in terms of impact, carbon stocks after logging are under a medium change threshold (MCT), indicating a negative effect. Through the improvement of forest operations, in particular the adoption of reduced impact logging (RIL) techniques and an adequate carbon monitoring program, among others, carbon loss due to logging could be considerably reduced and a faster ecosystem recovery and CO2 absorption allowed.

We recorded no difference in species richness or diversity of late-successional or early-successional trees between lightly and heavily logged sites. However, the abundance of late-successional species was lower in heavily than lightly logged sites. Moreover, there was no difference in species richness or diversity of trees among the three forests. Yet, abundances of late-successional trees were higher in Budongo Forest than in Mabira Forest and Kakamega Forest. Species richness, diversity and abundance of seedlings did not differ between lightly and heavily logged sites. Only the abundance of seedlings of late-successional species differed among the forests with more individuals in Budongo Forest than in Mabira Forest. This was corroborated by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) showing clear differences in composition of tree and seedling communities among the three forests.

The objectives of the study were to identify the optimal enrichment planting method vis-à-vis gap and line planting, and to evaluate the performance of two dipterocarps (Vatica cinerea and Dipterocarpus alatus) and three legumes (Afzelia xylocarpa, Pterocarpus macrocarpus, Dalbergia cochinchinensis) planted in logged-over mixed deciduous forest of Laos. The enrichment planting trial was arranged in a randomized complete block design with seven replications. Survival, height and diameter were measured seven years after planting and subjected to analysis of variance. Survival rate of planted seedlings did not vary between enrichment planting (p > 0.05). However, diameter and height growth was favored more in gaps than in planting lines. This was related to rapid canopy closure in both gaps and lines, albeit more remarkable in planting lines. Significant inter-species variation was detected for survival rate, height and diameter. The shade-tolerant dipterocarps had better survival and growth than the light-demanding leguminous species (p < 0.0001). The size class distribution of individuals was irregular, accentuating uneven light condition in the understory. Given the difficulty to maintain constant line width and even light condition, the cost of annual clean operation and the rigid geometric patterns of planting lines, the use of logged-over gaps for enrichment planting is recommended. Dipterocarpus alatus and V. cinerea are recommended for enrichment planting in mixed deciduous forests. A. xylocarpa, D. cochichinensis and P. macrocarpus can be planted in wider gaps, lines and open sites as plantation of mixed species or under canopy of young swidden forests. © 2010 Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Gap planting; Line planting; Secondary forest; Species trial; Tropical forest","Tigabu, M.; Faculty of Forest Sciences, PO Box 101, SE-230 53 Alnarp, Sweden; email: Mulualem.Tigabu@ess.slu.se",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955810765

This was achieved by comparing tree species diversity and yield in an unlogged forest (Strict Nature Reserve) and a forest reserve where active logging is in progress in Ondo State, Nigeria. Eight plots (20 m × 20 m) were assessed in each site using systematic sampling techniques. All living trees with dbh >10 cm were identified, categorized into families with their diameter at breast height (dbh) measured in each plot. Shannon-Weiner and species evenness indices were used to assess and compare tree species diversity and abundance. The results show that the tropical humid forest is very rich in tree species, as a total of 54 different tropical hardwood species from 23 families were encountered in both forest types. There were 46 species distributed among 21 families in the unlogged forest and 24 species in 14 families in the logged forest. Shannon-Weiner diversity index of 3.16 and 3.03 and evenness index of .83 and .81 were also obtained for the unlogged and logged forest, respectively. Every variable computed had a higher value in the unlogged forest relative to the logged forest. In the unlogged forest, the species with the highest number of occurrence was Mansonia altissima A.

Understanding degradation drivers and patterns is therefore crucial to managing forests to mitigate climate change and reduce biodiversity loss. Putative patterns of degradation affecting forest stocks, carbon, and biodiversity have variously been described previously, but these have not been quantitatively assessed together or tested systematically. Economic theory predicts a systematic allocation of land to its highest use value in response to distance from centers of demand. We tested this theory to see if forest exploitation would expand through time and space as concentric waves, with each wave targeting lower value products. We used forest data along a transect from 10 to 220 km from Dar es Salaam (DES), Tanzania, collected at two points in time (1991 and 2005). Our predictions were confirmed: high-value logging expanded 9 km·y-1, and an inner wave of lower value charcoal production 2 km·y-1. This resource utilization is shown to reduce the public goods of carbon storage and species richness, which significantly increased with each kilometer from DES [carbon, 0.2 Mg·ha-1; 0.1 species per sample area (0.4 ha)]. Our study suggests that tropical forest degradation can be modeled and predicted, with its attendant loss of some public goods. In sub-Saharan Africa, an area experiencing the highest rate of urban migration worldwide, coupled with a high dependence on forest-based resources, predicting the spatiotemporal patterns of degradation can inform policies designed to extract resources without unsustainably reducing carbon storage and biodiversity.","Biodiversity conservation; Carbon emissions; Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; Sustainability; Tropical forest degradation","Ahrends, A.; Royal Botanic Garden, 20A Inverleith Row, Edinburgh EH3 5LR, United Kingdom; email: aahrends@rbge.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957036680

We developed a disturbance index to model the effects of distance to and area of logging gaps on stem radial growth rates. This index was tested using census data of 43 neotropical tree species, representing a variety of life-history strategies and developmental stages, from a selectively logged forest at Paracou, French Guiana. Growth strategies were analyzed in light of two indicators: the inherent species growth rate (when disturbance index is null) and the species reaction (change in growth rate) to logging gaps. Across species, the predicted inherent growth rates in unlogged forest ranged from 0·25 to 6·47 mm year-1, with an average growth of 2·29 mm year-1. Ontogenetic shifts in inherent growth rate were found in 26 of the 43 species. Species growth response to logging gaps varied widely among species but was significantly positive for 27 species. The effect of ontogeny on growth response to logging was retained for 14 species, and species with inherent fast growth rate (5 mm year-1) responded less to logging gap disturbances than did species with slow inherent growth (1 mm year-1). Functional traits explained 19-42% of the variation in the inherent growth rate and in species' response across all developmental stages. Whereas maximum diameters and seed mass were strong predictors of inherent growth rate, maximum height, wood density, mode of germination and stem architecture were additionally involved in tree growth response.6. Synthesis and applications: This study provides a necessary framework for developing predictive post-logging growth models for the thousands of species comprising tropical forests and is sufficiently general to apply to a broad range of managed tropical forests. © 2010 The Authors.

However, human disturbance may alter guilds of seed predators including their body size distribution. These changes have the potential to affect seedling survival in logged forest and may alter forest composition and diversity. Methodology/Principal Findings: We manipulated seed density in plots beneath con- and heterospecific adult trees within a logged forest and excluded vertebrate predators of different body sizes using cages. We show that small and large-bodied predators differed in their effect on con- and heterospecific seedling mortality. In combination small and large-bodied predators dramatically decreased both con- and heterospecific seedling survival. In contrast, when larger-bodied predators were excluded small-bodied predators reduced conspecific seed survival leaving seeds coming from the distant tree of a different species. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that seed survival is affected differently by vertebrate predators according to their body size. Therefore, changes in the body size structure of the seed predator community in logged forests may change patterns of seed mortality and potentially affect recruitment and community composition. © 2010 Hautier et al.",,"Hautier, Y.; Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, , Zurich, Switzerland; email: yann.hautier@ieu.uzh.ch",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955352800

In the very near future, all forest harvesting is expected take place only in logged-over forests. One of the main challenges involves the classification of the forests by stocking classes. This problem does not exist in the management of undisturbed forest as the forests are generally homogenous in terms of size class distribution, and as such, the implementation of pre-felling inventory throughout the whole compartment to assess the growing stock is adequate. However, second growth forests logged more than 20 years ago are more heterogeneous in nature with high variations in size class distribution due to the previous harvesting operations. This characteristic is expected to be more profound in forest types with high clumping features or where harvesting was unevenly implemented, thus creating a patchy nature. To understand this, a study was conducted to assess and classify the second growth forests located in Tekam Forest Reserve in Pahang and Cherul Forest Reserve in Terengganu. A look at the stocking of second growth forests of various ages on both sites indicated that there was no particular trends of forest recovery. Classifying such forests based on years after logging was found to be unveiling. Since the study areas are large and heterogeneous, classification was made based on forest canopy densities. The approach was based on Forest Canopy Density (FCD) Model developed by the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) and was successfully tested in several tropical forest areas. Landsat 7 ETM+ imageries of the year 2003 were used for the classification. The classification yielded 4 FCD classes, namely Low (1-30%), Medium (31-50%), High (51-70%) and Very High (>70%). It was found that this approach gave a better reflection of the forest stocking classes and was more pragmatic to be implemented in large forest areas. The FCD classes could be used for forest classification although further refinement may be required to enhance forest management at the operational scale.","Forest canopy density; Forest classification; Logged-over forest","Khairulnajwan, A.

Under the current forest management system, Selective Management System (SMS), a cutting cycle of 25-30 years is being applied based on the projected volume growth rate of 2.0-2.75 m3 ha-1 year-1, mortality at 0.9% year -1 and ingrowth at 0.6% year-1. In terms of growing stock, the management requires at least 32 sound residual trees ha-1 (30-45 cm dbh) of commercial species to be left behind during harvesting to form the next harvest volume. This paper reviews results of some growth and yield studies conducted in Peninsular Malaysia. It also reports the initiative undertaken by FRIM to uniformly analyze 10 growth and yield study areas in Peninsular Malaysia. Results indicate that mean diameter growth was recorded at 0.4-0.7 cm year-1 and volume increment was at the rate of 1.0 -1.5 m3 ha-1 year-1. Results also indicate that mortality rate of more than 5% at 1-3 years after logging was higher that anticipated due to damage during harvesting operations. Rate of mortality stabilized at about 2% in plots logged more than 15 years. Results also indicate that higher ingrowth rate of about 4% in almost all of the plots. However, this was insufficient to offset the lost of stand volume due to mortality. A computer growth and yield prediction model namely Growth and Yield Models for Mixed Tropical Forests (GYMMTF) has been successfully developed by FRIM whereby non-linear volume functions (Chapman-Richard, Gompetz, and Logistic) were incorporated into the model. The logistic volume function was found to the best fitted function for forest in Peninsular Malaysia. The function for all species (15cm +) is Volume = 304.288/ (1 + exp (0.8359-0.02289*Year). A mathematical function that relates Stand Volume (Q) at Year t and initial growing stock (g) was developed and expressed as Q(t,g)-g = 0.05496838t1.370805 g 0.920355S exp.(-0.010787,1. - 0.01765623g + 0.00003009421(t g). Using these Volume expression, optimization study was carried to determine the optimum cutting cycle for second growth forests in Peninsular Malaysia. Overall results indicate that second growth forests are not growing to the projected level as expected under the current forest management practices. The current cutting cycle of 25 to 30 years has to be prolonged to at least 40-50 years. The optimum initial growing stock should be at least 90 m 3ha-1 for all trees above 15cm. Another option is to maintain the current cutting cycle, but the number of residual trees has to increase from. 32 tree ha-1 to 45-50 tree ha-1. Results of growth, and yield studies are very important in refining and adjusting the current management system to ensure that the management of productive forests in the country is biologically sound.","Cutting cycle; Growth and recovery; Second growth forests","Ismail, H.; Forest Research.

Here we present a methodology for estimating aboveground forest carbon, and apply it to a large Permanent Sample Plot system maintained by Papua New Guinea Forest Research Institute. We report the first estimates of forest carbon in lowland tropical forest in PNG. Average aboveground carbon in stems >10 cm diam. for 115 selectively harvested 1-ha plots in lowland tropical forest was 66.3±3.5 Mg C/ha (95% CI) while for 10 primary forest plots the average was 106.3±16.2 Mg C/ha. We applied ratios based on field observations, in-country studies, and the literature to estimate unmeasured pools of aboveground carbon (stems <10 cm diam., fine litter and coarse woody debris). Total aboveground carbon was estimated at 90.2 and 120.8 Mg C/ha in selectively harvested and primary lowland forest, respectively. Our estimate for primary tropical forest is lower than biome averages for tropical equatorial forest, and we hypothesize that frequent disturbances from fire, frost, landslides, and agriculture are limiting carbon stock development. The methodology and estimates presented here will assist the PNG government in its preparedness for mitigation initiatives, are of interest to communities that are seeking to participate in voluntary carbon markets, and will encourage transparency and consistency in the estimation of forest carbon. © 2010 The Author(s).

These data are very scarce in developing countries. Therefore, we collected and analyzed data on the rate of timber production of the free areas and the forest reserves in Ondo State, Nigeria. The data collected from the State Department of Forestry's official records, annual reports and files were on the species, volume and number of different economic timbers exploited on monthly basis between 2003 and 2005. Analyses were done with the student t-test and one-way analysis of variance. Results reveal that the highest numbers of species, families and stems were exploited in the free areas when compared with what was exploited from the reserves for the three-year period. However, the total volume of trees removed from the reserves was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) than what was removed from the free areas. A total 60 different indigenous hardwood species in 25 families were exploited from the free areas, and 57 in 23 families from the reserves. The total number of stems exploited from the forest ecosystem of Ondo state during the three-year period stood at 111 377 with an estimated volume of 295 089.67 m3. While the mean number of stems and volume exploited per annum is 37 125 and 98 363.22 m3, respectively. The monthly average number of stems and volume is 3 094 and 8 196 m3, respectively. The t-test results show that there were significant differences (p&lt;0.05) in number of stems and volume removed from the free areas and the reserves. The ANOVA results reveal a significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in logging activities between the years of 2003 and 2004 but there was a decline in year 2005. This trend reveals that economic timber species were disappearing from the forests and the ecosystem was seriously disturbed during logging activities.

In any event, policy instruments need to match the management regime socially most appropriate for a given type of forest land. Improved taxation may very well have a role to play in some management regimes but not in those that aim at sustaining the supply of tropical forest services. Different classes of incentives and disincentives are needed there.

Road construction has high priority in Africa, while negative impacts of roads on wildlife movement often are neglected. This study aims at providing information on the effects of roads on crossing behaviour of rainforest wildlife. The probability that wildlife would cross forest roads was analysed for association with ten different factors that were linked to road presence or construction. Factors were divided into three classes: vegetation cover, topography and human influence. A trackplot survey was done in southern Cameroon, Africa. Trackplots were laid along a 32 km unpaved logging road that intersects Campo-Ma'an National Park. Tracks of several species were found frequently (e.g. genets and porcupines); while others were found only sporadically (e.g. forest duikers and apes). The actual physical obstacles found along the road (e.g. logs, banks, etc.) were highly negatively correlated with crossing probabilities. For all wildlife species high vegetation cover was positively correlated to crossing probability. This study indicates that roads have a large impact on wildlife, and suggests which factors could be altered during road construction and maintenance in order to mitigate these impacts. © 2009 The Authors.

This study focuses on a successional tropical forest under logging practices in East Kalimantan province, Indonesia. We modeled the forest attributes using both a parametric multiple linear regression analysis and neural networks approach, with Landsat ETM data acquired in 2000 (ETM00). We compiled sample plot data using forest inventory data collected from 1997 to 1998. A total of 226 plots were used to train the models and 112 plots were used for the validation. The remote sensing data (spectral values, vegetation indices, texture, etc.) coupled with digital elevation model (DEM) were experimented with and selectively used to model basal area, stem volume and above ground biomass (AGB). We investigated the possibility to estimate the forest attributes from bitemporal ETM data by calibrating radiometric properties of the ETM image from 2003 (ETM03) using the multivariate alteration detection method. The Pearson correlations showed that the mean texture index is strongly correlated with the forest attributes. We show that neural networks resulted in a higher coefficient of determination (r2) and lower RMSE than multiple regressions for predicting the forest attributes. The estimated forest properties increased with the forest succession advancement (i.e. from the open forest to advanced secondary forest classes). The modeled basal area, stem volume and AGB varied from 10.7-15.1 m2 ha-1, 123.2-181.9 m3 ha-1, and 132.7-185.3 Mg ha-1, respectively. The RMSEr values of model fitting ranged from 11.2% to 13.3%, and the test dataset estimated slightly higher RMSEr which varied from 12% to 14.1%. The ETM03 forest attributes revealed favorable estimates, showing considerably higher estimates than the ETM00. The estimation of forest properties using neural networks makes Landsat data a valuable source of information for forest management, mainly with the recent free access to its historical dataset. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We censused a range of forest vertebrate species including large canopy-dwelling and terrestrial birds, three primates, one rodent and one tortoise. Two 4 km transects at each site were repeatedly surveyed during the wet season of 2008 to derive population density estimates on the basis of a cumulative survey effort of 416 km. RIL had ended within 16 months, and sites had been subjected to a mean extraction rate of 3.9 m3 ha-1, equivalent to only 1.1 trees ha-1. Three of the 15 vertebrate species examined here exhibited significantly different abundances at forest RIL sites, two of which were negative. Large frugivores such as primates were less abundant in sites subject to RIL, whereas smaller frugivores, granivores, folivores and insectivores were more common in logged sites. We are unable to reliably distinguish between responses of different taxonomic groups, since robust abundance metrics could only be estimated for four mammal species. Despite this, species traits including dietary guild, body mass, home range size and vertical stratification of forest use are used to explain varying responses. Our findings suggest that responsible reduced-impact logging practices in neotropical forests can be considered as a relatively benign form of forest management that can coexist with the requirements of both local economies and biodiversity conservation. However, our study sites experienced comparably low extraction rates, and detrimental effects such as hunting were low. Our results therefore provide an opportunity to scrutinise the effects of best practice logging systems, though do not necessarily represent typical circumstances across tropical forests. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated this in a 16-ha contiguous plot of subtropical wet forest in Puerto Rico, the Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP), which experienced two major hurricanes during the 15-year study and has a land use history (logging and agriculture 40 or more years hence) that differs in intensity between two areas of the plot. Using he LFDP as our ""landscape,"" we studied the spatial pattern of community change through time (3-5 year intervals) by calculating community dissimilarity between tree censuses for two size classes of trees (1 to <10 cm DBH and ≥10 cm DBH) in quadrats ranging in size from 0.010-1 ha and for the entire landscape, i.e., plot or land use type. The point at which the decline in community dissimilarity with quadrat size showed maximum curvature identified the dominant patch size (i.e., point of metastability). For canopy trees ≥10 cm dbh, there was no evidence that the community experienced landscape-wide successional changes in either land use type, and we found a consistent patch size of community change around 0.1 ha (range 0.091-0.107). For the understory tree and shrub community (1 to <10 cm dbh) there was some evidence of landscape-wide community changes over time in response to hurricane damage, apparently driven by interactions with the dominant canopy species, whose composition varied with land use intensity, and their species-specific susceptibility to hurricane damage. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.","Hurricane; Landscape dynamics; Luquillo Experimental Forest; Puerto Rico; Succession; Tropical forest","Zimmerman, J.

However, only a few have estimated the combined impacts of those anthropogenic activities. We conducted a detailed analysis of selective logging and forest fire impacts on natural forests in the southern Brazilian Amazon state of Mato Grosso, one of the key logging centers in the country. To achieve this goal a 13-year series of annual Landsat images (1992-2004) was used to test different remote sensing techniques for measuring the extent of selective logging and forest fires, and to estimate their impact and interaction with other land use types occurring in the study region. Forest canopy regeneration following these disturbances was also assessed. Field measurements and visual observations were conducted to validate remote sensing techniques. Our results indicated that the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index aerosol free (MSAVIaf) is a reliable estimator of fractional coverage under both clear sky and under smoky conditions in this study region. During the period of analysis, selective logging was responsible for disturbing the largest proportion (31%) of natural forest in the study area, immediately followed by deforestation (29%). Altogether, forest disturbances by selective logging and forest fires affected approximately 40% of the study site area. Once disturbed by selective logging activities, forests became more susceptible to fire in the study site. However, our results showed that fires may also occur in undisturbed forests. This indicates that there are further factors that may increase forest fire susceptibility in the study area. Those factors need to be better understood. Although selective logging affected the largest amount of natural forest in the study period, 35% and 28% of the observed losses of forest canopy cover were due to forest fire and selective logging combined and to forest fire only, respectively. Moreover, forest areas degraded by selective logging and forest fire is an addition to outright deforestation estimates and has yet to be accounted for by land use and land cover change assessments in tropical regions. Assuming that this observed trend of land use and land cover conversion continues, we predict that there will be no undisturbed forests remaining by 2011 in this study site. Finally, we estimated that 70% of the total forest area disturbed by logging and fire had sufficiently recovered to become undetectable using satellite data in 2004. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Brazilian Amazon; Forest degradation; Forest fire; Remote sensing; Selective logging","Matricardi, E.A.T.; Global Observatory for Ecosystem Services, 1405 South Harrison Road, Room 101, East Lansing, MI 48823, United States; email: ematricardi@gmail.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76349092448

The basidiomata collected on both live and dead trees represented 14 species of Hymenochaetaceae. Eleven of them belonged to Phellinus, six of which were new records to the Brazilian semi-arid area (P. grenadensis, P. linteus, P. maxonii, P. melleoporus, P. rimosus, and P. rhytyphloeus). Hymenochaetaceae diversity was not influenced by differences between stands, caused mostly by agriculture (subsistence farming), logging and tourism. The occurrence of taxa of Hymenochaetaceae was not significantly related to humidity, although P. piptadeniae and P. rimosus were more frequently sampled during the dry season. Even if most of the specimens of Hymenochaetaceae, Phellinus and P. piptadeniae have been found on live hosts, this observation was not statistically supported. On the other hand, P. rimosus occurred only on live hosts. The occurrence on live hosts may indicate a parasitic relationship, but they may be colonizing dead tissues of the live plants. Plants of Piptadenia and P. moniliformis had high incidence of Hymenochaetaceae, Phellinus and P. piptadeniae, while Caesalpinia microphylla had high incidence of Hymenochaetaceae, Phellinus and P. rimosus, suggesting that P. piptadeniae is host-recurrent and P. rimosus is host-specific on species of Fabaceae in the studied area. The results indicate that, at least when analysing Hymenochaetaceae, the biome Caatinga differs from other tropical forests where higher species richness is observed on decaying rather than live substrata, and where host-specificity/recurrence have been shown to be low. © Kevin D.

Piper aduncum arrived in Papua New Guinea before the mid-1930s. From the 1970s, it started to dominate the secondary fallow vegetation in many parts of the humid lowlands. It invaded grassland areas and also appeared in the highlands up to 2100 m asl. The seeds are dispersed by birds, bats and wind, as well as by logging equipment and in some localities, by migrating people. The combination of its vigorous generative characteristics (small and abundant seeds), high growth rate and the accidental or intentional spreading has resulted in its presence in most provinces of Papua New Guinea. In the 1990s, awareness of the spread of P. aduncum grew and there was a corresponding increase in research interest from a range of disciplines, e.g. pharmacology, agronomy, quarantine, forestry and taxonomy. The invasion of P. aduncum has affected the farming system and livelihood of many rural people. Future research should focus on mapping its extent, and studying its agronomic, socio-economic and ecological effects, particularly its effect on biodiversity.","Biodiversity; Bioinvasion; Pacific; Plant invaders; Tropical forest","Hartemink, A.

As frugivorous primates are important seed dispersers in tropical forests, the reduction of their populations may affect the ecological sustainability of selectively logged forests. This paper is the first to quantify the importance of timber tree species in the diet and nutritional ecology of a primate species. We studied spider monkeys (Ateles chamek) inhabiting a certified forestry concession in Bolivia where post-logging population declines of this species have been recorded. We show that spider monkeys occupying unlogged areas obtained approximately 50% of their total intake of macro-nutrients from timber tree species and exhibited a distinct preference for foraging within trees that were of harvestable size. Timber tree species dominated the spider monkeys' diet both during peak fruiting periods and during periods of fruit scarcity. We estimate that under current timber extraction intensities spider monkeys lose significant proportions of their food sources. Our results indicate that further extraction limits could be considered for Ficus boliviana, Spondias mombin and Pouteria nemorosa.

On large and mountainous islands, however, more modest impacts can be expected as the narrowly endemic species tend to inhabit montane forests where logging is difficult.

Our data suggest that a majority of the endemic bird species use lowland forest to some extent and that this may even apply to species hitherto associated with montane forest. If current commercial forestry programmes are continued, the forest habitat may be disturbed or lost over large parts of Makira, potentially undermining the natural resource base for the local subsistence economy, exacerbating climate change and threatening the integrity of one of the most important areas for biodiversity conservation on earth. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the habitat requirements of endemic species and the urgency of establishing and effectively managing community-based protected areas in suitable lowland forests of the Pacific. © 2010 The Authors.

However, secondary effects of logging, such as loss of vertebrate seed dispersers may also affect tree recruitment. We studied the recruitment and spatial distribution of five tree species namely Balanites wilsoniana, Celtis zenkeri, Chrysophyllum albidum, Cordia millenii and Ricinodendron heudelotii in Kibale, Budongo and Mabira Forests in Uganda. These forests have been subjected to varying degrees of disturbance leading to changes in their vertebrate seed dispersers. Vertebrate frugivores of the five tree species were identified. Three 1-ha plots were established around adult trees of the same five species in each forest and the distance from the juveniles to the nearest adult conspecific was measured to generate a recruitment curve. Frugivore visitation rates were high in the less disturbed Budongo and Kibale (2.2 and 1.6 individuals h-1 respectively) compared with the highly disturbed Mabira (0.9 individuals h-1). In the frugivore-impoverished forest, 70-90% of juveniles established beneath adult conspecifics, whereas in the less-disturbed forests juveniles were established up to 80 m from adult conspecifics. Shade-tolerant species capable of recruiting beneath adult conspecifics appeared to maintain their populations without dispersal. Consequently, disturbances leading to significant loss of vertebrates may alter tree recruitment and spatial distribution with consequences for long-term population viability of shade-intolerant tropical trees.

If such reductions are to be implemented, accurate and repeatable measurements of forest cover change and biomass will be required. In Papua New Guinea (PNG), which has one of the world's largest remaining areas of tropical forest, we used the best available data to estimate rainforest carbon stocks, and emissions from deforestation and degradation. We collated all available PNG field measurements which could be used to estimate carbon stocks in logged and unlogged forest. We extrapolated these plot-level estimates across the forested landscape using high-resolution forest mapping. We found the best estimate of forest carbon stocks contained in logged and unlogged forest in 2002 to be 4770 Mt (±13%). Our best estimate of gross forest carbon released through deforestation and degradation between 1972 and 2002 was 1178 Mt (±18%). By applying a long-term forest change model, we estimated that the carbon loss resulting from deforestation and degradation in 2001 was 53 Mt (±18%), rising from 24 Mt (±15%) in 1972. Forty-one percent of 2001 emissions resulted from logging, rising from 21% in 1972. Reducing emissions from logging is therefore a priority for PNG. The large uncertainty in our estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes is primarily due to the dearth of field measurements in both logged and unlogged forest, and the lack of PNG logging damage studies. Research priorities for PNG to increase the accuracy of forest carbon stock assessments are the collection of field measurements in unlogged forest and more spatially explicit logging damage studies. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the basic problems in forest management is the correct identification of species within the forest stand. While this is a well known issue, little consideration is given to how to mitigate this problem or its affects on management practices and conservation. This paper examines the current practice of forest inventories in the Brazilian Amazon, as part of the mandatory system of reduced impact logging (RIL), using extensive forest inventory verification. The results show that the RIL management plan implemented in the project area was based on a highly inaccurate forest inventory. At least 132 species or 43.5% of all species identified after botanical checking did not appear in the forest inventory and the common practice of matching vernacular names to scientific ones proved to be severely deficient. In contrast, a high percentage of field identifications based on local people's expertise were correct. We suggest changes to current practices, including the training and use of parataxonomists, the collection of samples for verification, and stricter government control over current practices, which will achieve greater accuracy in data collection and forest management planning. Ultimately, we argue that in the current climate of extensive deforestation and forest use, it is essential that all aspects of RIL systems are reevaluated in order to achieve economic and ecological sustainability. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Yet integrated approaches to natural forest management remain elusive across the tropics.

We analyze the current status of this combination and speculate on prospects and challenges regarding: (i) resource inventory, (ii) ecology and silviculture, (iii) conflict in the use of multipurpose tree species, (iv) wildlife conservation and use, (v) tenure, and (vi) product certification. Our conclusions remain preliminary due to the relative paucity of published studies and lessons learned on what has worked and what has not in the context of integrated management for timber and NTFPs. We propose at least three ways where further research is merited. One, in improving 'opportunistic' situations driven by selective timber harvesting that also enhance NTFP values. Two, to explicitly enhance both timber and NTFP values through targeted management interventions. Three, to explicitly assess biophysical, social, regulatory and institutional aspects so that combined benefits are maximized. Interventions for enhancing the compatibility of timber and NTFP extraction must be scaled in relation to the size of the area being managed, applied timber harvesting intensities, and the dynamics of multi-actor, forest partnerships (e.g., between the private sector and local communities).

Species richness and abundance were higher in the logged forest than in the unlogged forest, but not significantly so. Species assemblages, on the other hand, were significantly different and were associated with different environmental variables in the logged and unlogged forest. The findings from this study corroborate other studies that have shown that species composition in logged forest does not appear to return to unlogged forest composition, even after three to six decades have passed. Since this study was not a before-and-after comparison, it is difficult to confirm whether the differences arise from the residual effects of logging or from the general patchiness of species distribution in tropical forest.

We estimate that forests lost ca. 53% of above-ground biomass as a result of logging but despite this high level of degradation, logged forest retained considerable conservation value: floral species richness was higher in logged forest than in primary forest and whilst faunal species richness was typically lower in logged forest, in most cases the difference between habitats was no greater than ca. 10%.

During recovery, logged forest accumulated carbon at five times the rate of natural forest (1.4 and 0.28 Mg C ha-1 year-1, respectively). We conclude that allowing the continued regeneration of extensive areas of Borneo's forest that have already been logged, and are at risk of conversion to other land uses, would provide a significant carbon store that is likely to increase over time.

Former president (1986-1990) and Nobel-laureate Oscar Arias of the National Liberation Party was elected President in 2006. Throughout his term, Arias has focused on expanding the country’s social safety net and increasing free trade. He faced strong opposition to the country’s inclusion in the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), but eventually secured its ratification and implementation. Arias has also been active in foreign affairs, establishing diplomatic relations with China and Cuba after decades without formal ties. Once a predominantly agricultural nation, Costa Rica has established a diversified economy with a strong export sector. Under President Arias, the country has increased its social investment, experienced significant economic growth, and seen a reduction in poverty. The global financial crisis and economic downturn, however, threatens to erase these gains. President Arias has responded to the crisis with an ambitious fiscal stimulus and social protection plan. While the plan may do much to mitigate the social impacts of the crisis, analysts believe it will be unable to prevent Costa Rica’s economy from slowing considerably in 2009. In recent years, many have begun to recognize Costa Rica as a world leader in environmental protection. Successive Costa Rican administrations have sought to address the extensive deforestation and environmental degradation that resulted from decades of logging and agricultural expansion. The country’s innovative policies, strong conservation system, and commitment to alternative energy have done much to restore Costa Rica’s environment. Costa Rica is also party to a variety of international treaties and has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2021. This commitment to environmental protection has been a significant source of economic growth for the country as Costa Rica is now a top destination for ecotourism. The United States and Costa Rica have long enjoyed close relations as a result of the countries’ shared commitments to strengthening democracy, improving human rights, and advancing free trade. The countries have also maintained strong commercial ties, which are likely to become even more extensive as a result of the implementation of CAFTA-DR.

Firstly, there is a trend towards decentralised forest management, the devolution of land rights to local communities (in the form of indigenous and extractive reserves), and a more significant role for civil society organisations (CSOs) in forest management. Secondly, globalisation is bringing about trade liberalisation, expansion of external markets for timber and soybeans, and the spread of a worldwide concern for the fate of forests. While trade liberalisation and expanding world markets may spur increased deforestation, globalising concern about the loss of the forest’s ecological and livelihood services is creating new market-driven incentives for sustainable forest management and donor support to community-based forest management. The expectations regarding the outcome of these changes point to different directions. Many fear that the recent expansion of soybean cultivation and associated investments in road paving and improved waterways will further encourage deforestation and predatory logging (Carvalho 1999; Fearnside 2001).

These new initiatives are facing many of the same forest governance challenges that have stymied past efforts to improve the conservation and management of tropical forests.

However, the growing intensity of large-scale slash-and-burn agriculture and logging call for conservation research to assess how local people ́s traditional land-use practices result in conservation of local biodiversity, of which a species-rich and diverse component is the avian community. With this in mind, I conducted a preliminary survey of birds in small-scale secondary plots and in adjacent primary forest in Wanang Conservation Area in Papua New Guinea. I used mist-netting, point counts, and transect walks to compare the bird communities of 7-year-old secondary growth, and neighboring primary forest. The preliminary survey lasted 10 days and was conducted during the dry season (July) of 2008. I found no significant differences in summed bird abundances between forest types. However, species richness was higher in primary forest (98 species) than in secondary (78 species). The response of individual feeding guilds was also variable. Two habitats differed mainly in presence of canopy frugivores, which were more abundant (more than 80%) in primary than in secondary forests. A large difference (70%) was found also in understory and mid-story insectivores. Species occurring mainly in secondary forest were Hooded Butcherbird (Cracticus cassicus), Brown Oriole (Oriolus szalayi), and Helmeted Friarbird (Philemon buceroides).

Studies have shown that RIL promotes enhanced regeneration, allowing for earlier re-entry and more sustainable forest harvest of higher-quality commercial wood. The objective of this study was to assess regeneration of potential tree species in the logging corridors under reduced impact RIL in Block 13, Sela'an-Linau Forest Management Unit (FMU), UIu Baram, Sarawak, Malaysia. The study assessed commercial species regeneration potential in the form of number of species and composition, effect of different felling intensities and effect of slope condition on regeneration. The sampling method was modified based on the Section 3: Treatment Design in ""Silviculture Treatment of Logged-over Forest in the FOMISS Sämling Pilot Area (FSPA)"" report, focusing only along harvesting corridors. Regenerations of a 1.5 meter height to 10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were selected for evaluation. Results indicated that commercial species, mainly from dipterocarps families, regenerated well. A moderate number of felling intensities (2 trees per section) promoted a better number of regenerations. The results related to the light availability for regenerations after felling. Different number of regenerations according to the different sloping conditions were obvious, where steeper slopes have smaller number of regenerations. RIL provides an alternative way to determine regeneration condition and its effect were presented from a case study in Sela'an-Linau FMU at UIu Baram, Sarawak, Malaysia.","Forest regeneration; Logging damage; Reduced impact logging; Timber harvesting system","Pakhriazad, H.

The one-reference diameter (OD) observation model estimates DBH from a single diameter observation using empirical coefficients derived mainly from emergent dipterocarp trees. The two-reference diameter (TD) observation model estimates DBH from two diameter observations and assumes a logarithmic relationship between diameter and height. Prediction data to establish the models were collected in Cambodian lowland evergreen forests that are undergoing intensive illegal logging of emergent dipterocarp trees for timber. The OD model performed better than the TD model in predicting DBH and is extremely practical, as it requires only a single diameter observation.

However, information is very limited regarding the impact of logging on ecological processes such as species interactions. Here we hypothesize that timber extraction per se, that is, in the absence of hunting, affects the abundance of the frugivorous spider monkey, Ateles geoffroyi, and that this has indirect effects on the recruitment of a predominant tree species, Manilkara zapota, and the diversity of the understorey plant community. We compared logged and unlogged sites, using a paired design. In each management condition we conducted line transects and interviews to evaluate spider monkey abundance and game preferences, respectively. Impact on plant recruitment and understorey diversity were evaluated using 2 2-m plots (N = 320) established under 40 M. zapota tree crowns. No spider monkeys were recorded in logged sites whereas they were abundant (15 8 individuals per man-km) in unlogged sites. Interviews showed that spider monkeys are not hunted by local inhabitants. Logging was correlated with a reduction of the number of M. zapota fruits used by A. geoffroyi; an increase in the number of sites dominated by M. zapota; and a reduction in understorey plant diversity. Our results suggest that the absence of A. geoffroyi in logged sites can indirectly impact plant recruitment and diversity via the disruption of plant-frugivore interactions. Further work is needed to assess if these effects persist over the long term, to define if logging operations affect the overall diversity of tropical forests.

The geographic scope and intensity of these five drivers are in flux. Contemporary land use change includes deforestation (∼64,000 km2 yr-1 for the entire tropical forest biome) and natural forests regenerating on abandoned land (∼21,500 km2 yr-1 with just 29% of the biome evaluated). Commercial logging is shifting rapidly from Southeast Asia to Africa and South America, but local fuelwood consumption continues to constitute 71% of all wood production. Pantropical rates of net deforestation are declining even as secondary and logged forests increasingly replace old-growth forests. Hunters reduce frugivore, granivore and browser abundances in most forests. This alters seed dispersal, seed and seedling survival, and hence the species composition and spatial template of plant regeneration. Tropical governments have responded to these local threats by protecting 7% of all land for the strict conservation of nature - a commitment that is only matched poleward of 40°S and 70°N. Protected status often fails to stop hunters and is impotent against atmospheric and climate change. There are increasing reports of stark changes in the structure and dynamics of protected tropical forests. Four broad classes of mechanisms might contribute to these changes. Predictions are developed to distinguish among these mechanisms. © 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.","Above-ground biomass; Atmospheric change; Climate change; Deforestation; Fuel wood; Hunting; Land-use change; Protected areas; Reforestation; Secondary forest; Timber; Tree turnover","Wright, S.

They are an important refuge for many endangered species including orang utans. Ecosystem functioning is unusual: microbial decomposition is inhibited because the leaves are sclerophyllous and toxic to deter herbivory in the nutrient poor environment, yet bacteria are abundant and active in the surface layers of the peat, where they respire DOC leached from newly fallen leaves. The bacteria are subsequently consumed by aquatic invertebrates that are eaten by fish, and bacterially respired CO2 is assimilated by algae, so bacteria are thus vital to carbon and nutrient cycling. Peat swamp forests are highly sensitive to the impacts of logging, drainage and fire, due to the interdependence of the vegetation with the peat substrate, which relies on the maintenance of adequate water, canopy cover and leaf litter inputs. Even minor disturbances can increase the likelihood of fire, which is the major cause of CO2 emissions from regional peat swamp forests and which impact ecosystems worldwide by contributing to climate change. Indo-Malayan peat swamps affect the hydrology of surrounding ecosystems due to their large water storage capacity which slows the passage of floodwaters in wet seasons and maintains stream base flows during dry seasons. These forests are of global importance yet they are inadequately protected and vanishing rapidly, particularly due to agricultural conversion to oil palm, logging, drainage and annual fires. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Bacteria; Biodiversity; Carbon sequestration; Hydrology; Indonesia; Malaysia; Microbial communities; Peat fires; Tropical forests","Yule, C.

We employ a new framework for evaluating the rainfall regime of tropical forests and from this deduce precipitation-based boundaries for current forest viability. We then examine climate simulations by 19 global climate models (GCMs) in this context and find that most tend to underestimate current rainfall. GCMs also vary greatly in their projections of future climate change in Amazonia. We attempt to take into account the differences between GCM-simulated and observed rainfall regimes in the 20th century. Our analysis suggests that dry-season water stress is likely to increase in E. Amazonia over the 21st century, but the region tends toward a climate more appropriate to seasonal forest than to savanna. These seasonal forests may be resilient to seasonal drought but are likely to face intensified water stress caused by higher temperatures and to be vulnerable to fires, which are at present naturally rare in much of Amazonia. The spread of fire ignition associated with advancing deforestation, logging, and fragmentation may act as nucleation points that trigger the transition of these seasonal forests into fire-dominated, low biomass forests. Conversely, deliberate limitation of deforestation and fire may be an effective intervention to maintain Amazonian forest resilience in the face of imposed 21st-century climate change. Such intervention may be enough to navigate E.

Trees were used to produce shelter, transportation, furniture, utensils, paper and ink, medicines, heat, and even clothing. The tools of agriculture- The plow and dibbling stick-were primarily wooden, as were most weapons of war: The shaft s of arrows and spears, the hilts of swords, the palisades of forts, and the hulls of canoes and warships. In tropical landmasses the use of wood was even more commonplace, as the sheer extent of the forests as well as the variety, size, and shape of its trees precluded the use of alternatives except in the case of ostentatious display or absolute necessity. All this wood initially came from the forest, not from plantations; so the history of the forest is largely commensurate with the history of the societies that lived in and about it.1 The formation of complex societies always exacts a ""price"" from the forest and is usually associated with the development of ""core"" regions and the emergence of state systems.2 Because formation of a core region in the Philippines occurred aft er 1565, later than in any other major region of Southeast Asia, the parallel development of the state and the deforestation of the environment are more readily traceable and more extensively documented than elsewhere. On the one hand, this is a narrative of the construction of urban and municipal centers as sites of administration or evangelization and, on the other, of the development of an early agricultural market and the introduction of new crops mainly from the Americas. The maintenance of this state so far from Europe also necessitated its defense against enemies both from without and within, and the construction of ships and forts to protect it inevitably led to exploitation of the islands' timber resources. However, simply equating state formation and development with deforestation is too crude an analysis. Although, ultimately, the increase of one was mainly at the expense of the other, the specifi c woods that were required determined which species of trees were disproportionately felled. While the tropical forests of Southeast Asia are noted for their particularly rich fl ora and fauna, not all wood serves human purposes equally well.3 Besides, the demand for timber has become far less discerning, especially during the twentieth century. Prior to that time, particular woods were selected for specifi c purposes, the others oft en being viewed as worthless. Many tropical hardwoods, such as Southeast Asian teak (Tectona grandis), proved ideal for shipbuilding, being both extraordinarily durable and naturally resistant to shipworm.4 So soughtaft er did this wood become that the Dutch diff erentiated only teak or jati from other tropical hardwoods on Java, the rest of which were dismissed as worthless ""junglewood.""5 While entire areas of forest were gradually cleared for agricultural and settlement purposes, certain woods were actively sought out for their distinctive properties. This was the case with the timber best suited to military purposes, which was selected for its strength, density, and elasticity. While such selection contributed to the gradual deforestation of an area over time, it also caused a much more drastic decline in certain species and even in particular age groups within species. As mature specimens became exhausted in an area, trees were eagerly sought elsewhere, with the range limited only by ease of access and means of transport, largely fl uvial in the preindustrial age. Some species were therefore felled at a much faster rate than the forest in general. This loss of genetic material is known as ""erosion"" and may be defi ned as a permanent reduction in the richness or evenness of common localized forms (known as alleles) or the loss of a combination of alleles over time within a defi ned area. Genetic erosion is detrimental not only to the short- Term viability of individuals and populations but also to the evolutionary potential of species.6 Too few individuals of a species threaten its long- Term genetic integrity, increasing the likelihood of chance extinctions and aggravating the eff ects of inbreeding depression or the size and vitality of future generations.7 In the Philippines the demand since the late sixteenth century for certain types of timber preferred for the construction of buildings, fortifi cations, and ships has severely reduced the supply of specifi c valuable hardwoods, leaving existing stands isolated and making them more subject to the eff ects of genetic erosion.8 While it is unclear whether any species has become extinct as yet, some trees have become exceedingly rare and older, larger breeding specimens almost nonexistent. This chapter traces the outline of human agency and its eff ects on the forests of the Philippines in the context of the demands of warfare, examining three distinct military enterprises at diff erent periods: shipbuilding as a response to the threat of Dutch and Moro raiders during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, construction of forts in an attempt to subjugate the Cordilleras region of Luzon during the nineteenth century, and the agricultural autarky imposed by Japanese occupiers between 1942 and 1945. While warfare was a signifi cant factor in deforesting the Philippines, its eff ects were not uniform, leading to the gradual genetic erosion of certain species even before the onset of widespread commercial logging in the twentieth century.

The challenge has increased in the recent years in timber producing countries like Malaysia due to increased demands and environmental pressures that need forest managers to make crucial and quick decisions. At present, forest management not only deals with harvesting but also conservation and rehabilitation. These normally involve large volumes of data and analysis, which have been mostly carried out manually in most tropical countries. As a result, the efficiencies and effectiveness of the decisions implemented are limited. To overcome this difficulty, this study proposes the development of a GIS-based tool for timber harvesting planning for a tropical forest in Malaysia. Timber harvesting is chosen in this study because it is the most sensitive environmental activity in tropical forests. This study presents an analysis of the rule-set, as specified in the Selective Management System (SMS), which is used during forest harvesting in Malaysia. The rules are implemented in a Geographic Information System (GIS), using the ArcGIS 9TM software, and these are applied to a small test area, part of the Bubu Forest Reserve (FR) in Taiping, Perak, Malaysia. Although most of the rules specified in the SMS are based on fixed threshold values, this study also presents an analysis in which the threshold values are modified, such that the effect of variation in the thresholds is explored. Thus, the study evaluates the sensitivity of the forest management system to the specific threshold values employed in the SMS.","Geographic Information System (GIS); Harvesting and Selective Management System (SMS); Tropical forest","Safiah Yusmah, M.

As a first aspect, we investigated whether or not expected payments for avoided deforestation would be acceptable for tropical farmers in Southern Ecuador, with the study area located directly adjacent to the Podocarpus National Park. Second, we explored possible distributional effects resulting from voluntary or mandatory remuneration schemes to avoid deforestation. Finally, a productive sustainable land use was conceptualised to be combined with payments for avoided deforestation to avoid leakage (i.e. deforestation processes elsewhere when avoided at a given farm). Farm level land use scenarios with (""business as usual"") and without deforestation (""conservation strategy"") were compared. Compensation per Mg Carbon (C) that is not emitted into the atmosphere under the ""conservation strategy"" was derived to achieve a monetary land net present value (NPV, sum of discounted future net revenues) equal to the NPV obtained under ""business as usual"". Avoided carbon emissions were computed from above ground C in tropical forests of the project area and supplemented by information on soil carbon from another study. Economic data for cattle pasturing were obtained from a farm survey (130 households) to investigate distributional effects. To derive sustainable land use concepts, a risk sensitive bioeconomic farm model was used that considered effects of risk compensation when combining pasture with reforestation of abandoned farm lands and selective logging of natural forests. The results showed that only a few farmers (20 out of 130) would possibly accept a compensation price of US$ 10 per Mg avoided C emission, a C-compensation that is believed by other authors to reduce deforestation by 65%. Rather a compensation of around US$ 25 per Mg C was necessary to address compensation requirements of farmers who hold 50% of the tropical forest area in our study. The implementation of a voluntary remuneration scheme for avoided deforestation would not introduce systematic distributional effects (such as that only the biggest farmers would benefit from compensation), while a mandatory and enforced ban on deforestation coupled with a ""fair"" compensation payment equal to mean compensation requirements may lead to undesirable effects for many farmers. Finally, we demonstrate a mixed sustainable land use concept that depended on cheap credits for reforestation of abandoned pasture lands. This concept was able to stop farm level deforestation and to enlarge the economic value of farms through various combined land use options (agricultural and forestry options). The combination of land uses led to risk compensatory effects and a more efficient land use by reintegrating unproductive abandoned areas back into the economical process. In our conclusion a combination of payments for avoided deforestation along with productive land use concepts provided a viable solution for tropical forest conservation.","Carbon storage; Conservation payments; Sustainable land use; Tropical forest conservation","Knoke, T.; Technische Universität München (TUM), Hans-Carl-von-Carlowitz-Platz 2, 85354 Freising, Germany; email: knoke@forst.wzw.tum.de",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950276862

Nevertheless, the pollen dispersal pattern of dipterocarp, main canopy tree species in palaeo-tropical forest remains unclear, and flowering intensity variation in the field suggests heterogeneity of fecundity.MethodsPollen dispersal patterns and male fecundity variation of Shorea leprosula and Shorea parvifolia ssp. parvifolia on Peninsular Malaysian were investigated during two general flowering seasons (2001 and 2002), using a neighbourhood model modified by including terms accounting for variation in male fecundity among individual trees to express heterogeneity in flowering.Key ResultsThe pollen dispersal patterns of the two dipterocarp species were affected by differences in conspecific tree flowering density, and reductions in conspecific tree flowering density led to an increased selfing rate. Active pollen dispersal and a larger number of effective paternal parents were observed for both species in the season of greater magnitude of general flowering (2002).ConclusionsThe magnitude of general flowering, male fecundity variation, and distance between pollen donors and mother trees should be taken into account when attempting to predict the effects of management practices on the self-fertilization and genetic structure of key tree species in tropical forest, and also the sustainability of possible management strategies, especially selective logging regimes.","Dipterocarp; General flowering; Male fecundity variation; Microsatellite marker; Paternity analysis; Pollen dispersal; Shorea; Tropical forest","Tani, N.; Forestry Division, , Ohwashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8686, Japan; email: ntani@affrc.go.jp",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-73149083258

We review the potential for this mechanism [reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD)] to provoke ecological damages and promote ecological cobenefits. Nations could potentially participate in REDD by slowing clear-cutting of mature tropical forest, slowing or decreasing the impact of selective logging, promoting forest regeneration and restoration, and expanding tree plantations. REDD could also foster efforts to reduce the incidence of forest fire. Potential ecological costs include the accelerated loss (through displaced agricultural expansion) of low-biomass, high-conservation-value ecosystems, and substitution of low-biomass vegeta- tion by monoculture tree plantations. These costs could be avoided through measures that protect low-biomass native ecosystems. Substantial ecological cobenefits should be conferred under most circumstances, and include the maintenance or restoration of (1) watershed functions, (2) local and regional climate regimes, (3) soils and biogeochemical processes, (4) water quality and aquatic habitat, and (5) terrestrial habitat. Some tools already being developed to monitor, report and verify (MRV) carbon emissions performance can also be used to measure other elements of ecosystem function, making development of MRV systems for ecological cobenefits a concrete possibility. Analysis of possible REDD program interven- tions in a large-scale Amazon landscape indicates that even modest flows of forest carbon funding can provide substantial cobenefits for aquatic ecosystems, but that the functional integrity of the landscape's myriad small watersheds would be best protected under a more even spatial distribution of forests. Because of its focus on an ecosystem service with global benefits, REDD could access a large pool of global stakeholders willing to pay to maintain carbon in forests, thereby providing a potential cascade of ecosystem services to local stakeholders who would otherwise be unable to afford them. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Carbon; Climate; Deforestation; Degradation; Ecosystem services; Land-use and land-cover change; REDD; Tropical conservation; Watersheds; Xingu river basin","Stickler, C.M.; The Woods Hole Research Center, 149 Woods Hole Road, Falmouth, MA 02540, United States; email: cstickler@whrc.org",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-71549136024

Several traits have been important for species survival in the recent and distant geological past, including seed dormancy and vegetative growth in plants, small body size in mammals, and vagility in insects. For major past catastrophes, such as the five mass extinction events, large range size and vagility or dispersal were key to species survival. Traits that make some species more vulnerable to extinction are consistent across time scales. Terrestrial organisms, particularly animals, are more extinction prone than marine organisms. Plants that persist through dramatic changes often reproduce vegetatively and possess mechanisms of die back. Synergistic interactions between current anthropogenic threats, such as logging, fire, hunting, pests and diseases, and climate change are frequent. Rising temperatures threaten all organisms, perhaps particularly tropical organisms adapted to small temperature ranges and isolated by distance from suitable future climates. Mutualist species and trophic specialists may also be more threatened because of such range-shift gaps. Phylogenetically specialized groups may be collectively more prone to extinction than generalists. Characterization of tropical forest species' vulnerability to anthropogenic change is constrained by complex interactions among threats and by both taxonomic and ecological impediments, including gross undersampling of biotas and poor understanding of the spatial patterns of taxa at all scales. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.","Extinction vulnerability; Range shifts; Species traits; Tropical forest species","Stork, N.

The pan-tropical geography of forest change is a challenge to assess, and improved estimates of the human footprint in the tropics are critical to understanding potential changes in biodiversity. We combined recently published and new satellite observations, along with images from Google Earth and a literature review, to estimate the contemporary global extent of deforestation, selective logging, and secondary regrowth in humid tropical forests. Roughly 1.4% of the biome was deforested between 2000 and 2005. As of 2005, about half of the humid tropical forest biome contained 50% or less tree cover. Although not directly comparable to deforestation, geographic estimates of selective logging indicate that at least 20% of the humid tropical forest biome was undergoing some level of timber harvesting between 2000 and 2005. Forest recovery estimates are even less certain, but a compilation of available reports suggests that at least 1.2% of the humid tropical forest biome was in some stage of long-term secondary regrowth in 2000. Nearly 70% of the regrowth reports indicate forest regeneration in hilly, upland, and mountainous environments considered marginal for large-scale agriculture and ranching. Our estimates of the human footprint are conservative because they do not resolve very small-scale deforestation, low-intensity logging, and unreported secondary regrowth, nor do they incorporate other impacts on tropical forest ecosystems, such as fire and hunting. Our results highlight the enormous geographic extent of forest change throughout the humid tropics and the considerable limitations of the science and technology available for such a synthesis. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.","Deforestation; Forest degradation; Forest disturbance; Forest regrowth; Secondary forest; Selective logging; Timber harvesting","Asner, G.

Using recently updated data sets from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, we evaluated the incidence of perceived threats to all known mammal, bird, and amphibian species in tropical forests. Vulnerable, endangered, and extinct species were collectively far more likely to be imperiled by combinations of threats than expected by chance. Among 45 possible pairwise combinations of 10 different threats, 69%, 93%, and 71% were significantly more frequent than expected for threatened mammals, birds, and amphibians, respectively, even with a stringent Bonferroni-corrected probability value (p = 0.003). Based on this analysis, we identified five key environmental synergisms in the tropics and speculate on the existence of others. The most important involve interactions between habitat loss or alteration (from agriculture, urban sprawl, infrastructure, or logging) and other anthropogenic disturbances such as hunting, fire, exotic-species invasions, or pollution. Climatic change and emerging pathogens also can interact with other threats. We assert that environmental synergisms are more likely the norm than the exception for threatened species and ecosystems, can vary markedly in nature among geographic regions and taxa, and may be exceedingly difficult to predict in terms of their ultimate impacts. The perils posed by environmental synergisms highlight the need for a precautionary approach to tropical biodiversity conservation. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.","Climatic change; Endangered species; Environmental synergisms; Extinction; Fire; Habitat fragmentation; Hunting; IUCN Red Data Book; Logging; Species invasions; Tropical forests","Laurance, W.

Extractive industries, including logging, can accelerate exploitation of wildlife by opening forests to hunters and creating markets for bushmeat. We monitored human demographics, bushmeat supply in markets, and household bushmeat consumption in five logging towns in the northern Republic of Congo. Over 6 years we recorded 29,570 animals in town markets and collected 48,920 household meal records. Development of industrial logging operations led to a 69% increase in the population of logging towns and a 64% increase in bushmeat supply. The immigration of workers, jobseekers, and their families altered hunting patterns and was associated with increased use of wire snares and increased diversity in the species hunted and consumed. Immigrants hunted 72% of all bushmeat, which suggests the short-term benefits of hunting accrue disproportionately to ""outsiders"" to the detriment of indigenous peoples who have prior, legitimate claims to wildlife resources. Our results suggest that the greatest threat of logging to biodiversity may be the permanent urbanization of frontier forests. Although enforcement of hunting laws and promotion of alternative sources of protein may help curb the pressure on wildlife, the best strategy for biodiversity conservation may be to keep saw mills and the towns that develop around them out of forests. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.","Biodiversity conservation; Bushmeat; Congo; Household diet; Logging; Tropical forest; Wildlife","Poulsen, J.

We evaluated the regeneration status of 22 commercial tree species in a managed semideciduous tropical rain forest in Southern Mexico. The study was carried out in six harvesting areas along a 16-year chronosequence. In each area, 10 transects (1000 m2) were established and all trees &gt;50 cm height and &lt;10 cm diameter were recorded. We evaluated the relationships between seedling and sapling abundance, and canopy cover and disturbance condition (closed forest, canopy gap, log landing, skid road, primary road and secondary road). The area occupied by closed forest canopy increased with age of harvesting area (65-91% of sampled area), while the area occupied by canopy gaps decreased (22-9%). Log landings occupied less than 1% of the sampled area. The predominant canopy cover was 75-80% in all harvesting areas, even in the most recently harvested areas. The highest densities of seedlings and saplings, of both shade tolerant and intolerant species, were found in log landing and skid trails, followed by secondary roads. Even Simarouba glauca, a shade tolerant species, displayed higher densities in sites with ≤65% of canopy cover. Our results support previous findings and indicate that the levels of disturbance caused by existing harvesting procedures may be inadequate to promote sufficient regeneration of not only light demanding desirable species but also for some of the evaluated shade tolerant species of commercial interest. Seedling and sapling densities exhibited by Swietenia macrophylla, for example, are insufficient to support current harvesting rates. The application of a spatial mixed system with patch-cuts of different sizes, a consequence of group felling, could be applied to provide the necessary conditions for the regeneration of the main commercial species. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Location Sumatra, Indonesia. Methods We processed and analysed 98 corresponding LANDSAT satellite images with a c. 800 m2 resolution to map deforestation from 1990 to 2000 across 440,000 km2 on the main island of Sumatra and the smaller island of Siberut. We compared deforestation rates across three categories of land: (1) within PAs; (2) in adjacent unprotected land lying with 10 km of PA boundaries; and (3) within the wider unprotected landscape. We used the statistical method of propensity score matching to predict the deforestation that would have been observed had there been no PAs and to control for the generally remote locations in which Sumatran PAs were established. Results During the period 1990-2000 deforestation rates were found to be lower inside PAs than in adjacent unprotected areas or in the wider landscape. Deforestation rates were also found to be lower in adjacent unprotected areas than in the wider landscape. Main conclusions Sumatran PAs have lower deforestation rates than unprotected areas. Furthermore, a reduction in deforestation rates inside Sumatran PAs has promoted protection, rather than deforestation, in adjacent unprotected land lying within 10 km of PA boundaries. Despite this positive evaluation, deforestation and logging have not halted within the boundaries of Sumatran PAs. Therefore the long-term viability of Sumatran forests remains open to question. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Confounding variables; Conservation; Deforestation; Indonesia; Leakage; Propensity score matching; Protected areas; Siberut; Sumatra","Gaveau, D.

In addition to deforestation (clearing of forest), we also estimate clearing rates and emissions for savannas (especially the cerrado, or central Brazilian savanna), which have not been included in Brazil's monitoring of deforestation. The rate of clearing of savannas was much more rapid in the 1980s and 1990s than in recent years. Over the 2006-2007 period (one year) 204 × 103 ha of forest and 30 × 103 ha of savanna were cleared in Mato Grosso, representing a gross loss of biomass carbon (above + belowground) of 66.0 and 1.8 × 106 MgC, respectively. In the same year in Rondônia, 130 × 103 ha of forest was cleared, representing gross losses of biomass of 40.4 × 106 MgC. Data on clearing of savanna in Rondônia are unavailable, but the rate is believed to be small in the year in question. Net losses of carbon stock for Mato Grosso forest, Mato Grosso savanna and Rondônia forest were 29.0, 0.5 and 18.5 × 106 MgC, respectively. Including soil carbon loss and the effects of trace-gas emissions (using global warming potentials for CH4 and N2O from the IPCC's 2007 Fourth Assessment Report), the impact of these emission sources totaled 30.9, 0.6 and 25.4 × 106 Mg CO2-equivalent C, respectively. These impacts approximate the combined effect of logging and clearing because the forest biomasses used are based on surveys conducted before many forests were exposed to logging. The total emission from Mato Grosso and Rondônia of 56.9 × 106 Mg CO2-equivalent C can be compared with Brazil's annual emission of approximately 80 × 106 MgC from fossil-fuel combustion. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Peru's forestry regime has recently been reformed and more than 7 million ha has been assigned as forest concessions. This potentially has a drastic impact on the land-use practices and species composition of the assigned areas. Nevertheless, the environmental variation found within the concessions and the process applied to delimit them are poorly studied and documented. Thus, it is difficult to estimate the biological impacts of forestry activities in concessions or plan them sustainably. This paper reveals the characteristics of the current concession allocation in Loreto, Peruvian Amazonia, using environmental and access-related variables and compares the concessions to other major land-use assignments. The work draws on a number of data sets describing land-use, ecosystem diversity, and fluvial network in the region. According to our data, certain environment types such as relatively fertile Pebas soils are overrepresented in the concessions, while others, like floodplain forests, are underrepresented in comparison to other land-use assignments. Concessions also have less anthropogenic disturbance than other areas. Furthermore, concessions are located on average further from the river network than the other land-use assignments studied. We claim that forest classification based on productivity, soil fertility, accessibility, and biodiversity patterns is an achievable long-term goal for forest authorities in Peru, and in many other tropical countries. We present a rough design of a geographic information system incorporating environmental, logging, and access-related data that could be applied to approach this goal in Peru. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Amazonia; Environmental information; Forest concessions; Geographic information systems; Land-use planning; Tropical forestry","Salo, M.; Department of Biology, , Turku 20014, Finland; email: mattsal@utu.fi",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349772946

The effectiveness of this strategy will likely depend on species-specific, population-level responses to logging. We conducted a survey (749 line transects over 3450 km) in logging concessions (1.2 million ha) in the northern Republic of Congo to examine the impact of logging on large mammal populations, including endangered species such as the elephant (Loxodonta africana), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), and bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus). When we estimated species abundance without consideration of transect characteristics, species abundances in logged and unlogged forests were not different for most species. When we modeled the data with a hurdle model approach, however, analyzing species presence and conditional abundance separately with generalized additive models and then combining them to calculate the mean species abundance, species abundance varied strongly depending on transect characteristics. The mean species abundance was often related to the distance to unlogged forest, which suggests that intact forest serves as source habitat for several species. The mean species abundance responded nonlinearly to logging history, changing over 30 years as the forest recovered from logging. Finally the distance away from roads, natural forest clearings, and villages also determined the abundance of mammals. Our results suggest that logged forest can extend the conservation estate for many of Central Africa's most threatened species if managed appropriately. In addition to limiting hunting, logging concessions must be large, contain patches of unlogged forest, and include forest with different logging histories. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.","Chimpanzee; Elephant; Generalized additive model; Gorilla; Logging concession; Republic of Congo; Tropical forest","Clark, C.

Given that grass invasions can substantially alter fire regimes, we studied grass distributions in a tropical dry forest 1-5 yr after selective logging, and experimentally tested the effect of forest fire on populations of invasive grasses. In unlogged forests and in microhabitats created by selective logging we found a total of four alien and 16 native grass species. Grasses covered 2% of unlogged and 4% of logged forest, with grass cover in logged forest concentrated in areas directly disturbed by logging; log landings and roads had relatively greater grass cover (37% and 17%, respectively) than did skid trails (10%) and felling gaps (8%). Total grass cover and grass species richness increased with canopy openness and were greatest in sites most severely disturbed by logging. The grass flora of these disturbed areas was composed mostly of native ruderal species (e.g., Digitaria insularis, Leptochloa virgata), a native bamboo (Guadua paniculata), and Urochloa (Panicum) maxima, a caespitose C4 pasture grass introduced from Africa. Urochloa maxima formed monodominant stands (up to 91% cover and 2-3 m tall) and grew on 69% of log landings and 38% of roads. To better understand the potentially synergistic effects of logging and fire on the early stages of grass invasion, we tested the effect of a 12-ha experimental fire on U. maxima populations in a selectively logged forest. Three years after the fire, the area covered by alien grass in burned forest increased fourfold from 400 m2 (pre-fire) to 1660 m2; over the same period in a logged but unburned (control) area, U. maxima cover decreased from 398 m2 to 276 m2. Increased canopy openness due to fire-induced tree mortality corresponded with the greater magnitude of grass invasion following fire. Selective logging of this dry forest on the southern edge of the Amazon Basin promotes alien grass invasion; when coupled with fire, the rate of invasion substantially increased. Recognition of the grass-promoting potential of selective logging is important for understanding the possible fates of tropical forests in fire-prone regions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The available data in the literature suggest, however, that the effect of silvicultural treatments on tree growth is smaller in dry forests than in humid forest tree species. In this study, we analyze the effect of logging and application of additional silvicultural treatments (liana cutting and girdling of competing trees) on the growth rates of future crop trees (FCTs; i.e., trees of current and potentially commercial timber species with adequate form and apparent growth potential). The study was carried out in a tropical dry forest in Bolivia where a set of 21.25-ha plots were monitored for 4 years post-logging. Plots received one of four treatments that varied in intensity of both logging and silvicultural treatments as follows: normal (reduced-impact) logging; normal logging and low-intensity silviculture; increased logging intensity and high-intensity silviculture; and, unlogged controls. The silvicultural treatments applied to FCTs involved liberation from lianas and overtopping trees. Results showed that rates of FCT stem diameter growth increased with light availability, logging intensity, and intensity of silvicultural treatments, and decrease with liana infestation degree. Growth rate increment was larger in the light and intensive silvicultural treatment (22-27%). Long-lived pioneer species showed the strongest response to intensive silviculture (50% increase) followed by total shade-tolerant species (24%) and partial shade-tolerant species (10%). While reduced-impact logging is often not sufficient to guarantee the sustainability of timber yields, application of silvicultural treatments that substantially enhanced the growth rates of FCTs will help move the management of these forests closer to the goal of sustained yield. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To compare the effect of different logging systems on the lianas diversity in tropical rain forest, we recorded all lianas and trees ≥1 cm dbh in two 40-year-old forest sites after clear cutting (CC) and selective cutting (SC) as well as in an old-growth (OG) lowland tropical rain forest on Hainan Island in south China. Results showed that OG contained fewer liana stems and lower species richness (stems: 261, richness: 42 in 1 ha) than CC (606, 52) and SC (727, 50). However, OG had the highest Fisher's α diversity index (17.3) and species richness per stem (0.184). Species composition and dbh class distribution of lianas varied significantly with different logging systems. The mean liana dbh in OG (22.1 cm) were higher than those in CC (7.0 cm) and SC (10.4 cm). Stem twining was the most frequent climbing mechanism represented in the forest, as shown by the greatest species richness, abundance, basal area, and host tree number with this mechanism. The percent of host tree stems ≥4 cm dbh hosting at least one liana individual in SC (39%) was higher than CC (23%) and OG (19.5%). Large host trees (dbh≥60 cm) were more likely to be infested by lianas in SC and OG.

Conventional selective logging led to emissions equivalent to more than a third of aboveground carbon stocks in plots without TSI (85 Mg C/ha), while plots with TSI lost more than one-half of aboveground carbon stocks (142 Mg C/ha). Within 20 years of logging, plots without TSI sequestered aboveground carbon equivalent to more than 80% of aboveground carbon lost to logging (-70.7 Mg C/ha), and our simulations predicted an equilibrium aboveground carbon balance within 45 years of logging. In contrast, plots with intensive TSI are predicted to require more than 100 years to sequester aboveground carbon lost to emissions.

However, current problems in developing suitable hunting management schemes for dense tropical forests arise from (1) the difficulty associated with setting quotas which take into account indiscriminate local hunting practices (e.g. snare trapping) and the ill-defined modes of resource appropriation by local populations, (2) the difficulty associated with evaluating the effect of illegal hunting, i.e. poaching, and (3) the relative complexity of the main available model. To overcome this, we propose to develop alternative management models where village hunting is planned along the same lines as existing logging operation models, through the implementation of a system of spatio-temporal rotation of hunting areas. In practice, the logging concession, initially divided into annual logging areas, is divided into similar annual hunting areas (AHAs), which are opened to hunting during the year preceding the logging operations. A depletion of the wildlife stock is expected within the annually opened hunting areas, but the model assumes a progressive re-colonization of the depleted AHA in subsequent years from neighbouring ones. In this paper, an empirical model of such a controlled hunting system employing spatio-temporal rotation of hunting areas is tested within a Forestry Management Unit (FMU) covering 47,585 ha in the Dja region, in south-east Cameroon. The model, based on large forest areas, seems particularly well adapted to Cameroon's dense forests because it fits within the existing legal framework of Community-Managed Zones of Hunting Interest (CMZHI) and is aligned with current logging concession operations. Preliminary results suggest that sustainable hunting can be achieved in the FMU, provided a management scheme of AHAs is strictly enforced through effective stakeholder commitment. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Cameroon; Community-managed zones of hunting interest; Hunting management; Logging","Vermeulen, C.; Laboratory of Tropical and Subtropical Forestry, 2 Passage des Déportés, 5030 Gembloux, Belgium; email: vermeulen.c@fsagx.ac.be",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350623275

Lianas generally retard the growth and carbon capture of trees , potentially enhancing global change. It is not known whether all liana species play such a role and which land-use disturbances determined the current species composition of liana communities. We surveyed all lianas ≥1 cm diameter at ground level and all trees ≥3.16 cm diameter at 1.3 m above ground in twelve plots 20 × 20-m each in semi-evergreen tropical forests in Northeastern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, re-measuring the trees 15 mo later. Lianas were classified into two anatomic types: ""hard "" (typical stem with compact xylem masses) and ""soft"" (with much parenchyma and wide xylem vessels). History, archaeology, anthropology, and remote sensing studies, as well as non-formal interviews were used to determine the land-use history y of each stand. Increasing densities of the hard liana Dalbergia glabra (Leguminosae), but not of soft lianas - Arrabidaea spp, Cydista sp, MellIoaspp (Bignoniaceae) and Serjania sp (Sapindaceae), were related to more rapid relative growth rates of trees (Linear regression, R2 = 0.680, P = 0.001). Where D. glabra dominated, the trees hosting it grew more rapidly, but trees with large liana-tangles grew more slowly where soft lianas were dominant (Kruskall Wallis, P &gt; 0.01 in both cases). The anatomy of soft lianas suggests that they are less able to survive burn after slash during shifting cultivation than D. glabra - the previous land use where D. glabra dominated. Soft-liana dominated stands were not burnt but subjected to liana-cut during logging and extraction of lianas, palm leaves and latex from Manilkara %apota trees. Our results suggest that some lianas enhance carbon capture mitigating global change, whereas others do not and that the dominance of one liana species is a legacy of previous land use, which is better understood by combining natural and social sciences.","Burn; Injury-recovery; Lianas; Relative abundance; Secondary forest; Slash; Tree growth; Yucatan","Garrido-Perez, E.

This paper investigates effects of interactions, perceptions of protected areas (PAs) and sociodemographic variables on conservation attitudes, and the correlates of illegal resource extraction among 660 households from 33 villages bordering eight PAs on Sulawesi (Indonesia). Mixed-effect multiple regression analyses showed that the most important predictors of the support for PAs included the degree of involvement in management, presence/absence of PA-human conflict, perceived sustainability of forest resources and length of residency in Sulawesi. Notably, active participation in community management by transmigrants and the reconciliation of land-rights conflicts for natives may promote favourable conservation attitudes. Ordination and correlation analyses also revealed that the extent of illegal resource harvesting activities, such as hunting and logging, were significantly influenced by a negative conservation attitude and past conflict with PA establishment. Garnering support for PAs through conservation education and resolving land-rights disputes could potentially alleviate illegal resource extraction. The disparity in resource extraction patterns among the villages across all PAs confirms the importance of adopting site-specific conservation strategies that may make PAs across the biologically unique yet critically threatened Indonesian Archipelago more effective. © 2009 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.","Biodiversity protection; Community management; Land-rights conflict; South-east Asia","Sodhi, N.

One of the world's largest remaining areas of tropical forest is located in Papua New Guinea. Here we show that change in its extent and condition has occurred to a greater extent than previously recorded. We assessed deforestation and forest degradation in Papua New Guinea by comparing a land-cover map from 1972 with a land-cover map created from nationwide high-resolution satellite imagery recorded since 2002. In 2002 there were 28,251,967 ha of tropical rain forest. Between 1972 and 2002, a net 15 percent of Papua New Guinea's tropical forests were cleared and 8.8 percent were degraded through logging. The drivers of forest change have been concentrated within the accessible forest estate where a net 36 percent were degraded or deforested through both forestry and nonforestry processes. Since 1972, 13 percent of upper montane forests have also been lost. We estimate that over the period 1990-2002, overall rates of change generally increased and varied between 0.8 and 1.8 percent/yr, while rates in commercially accessible forest have been far higher - having varied between 1.1 and 3.4 percent/yr. These rates are far higher than those reported by the FAO over the same period.

The results showed that species richness, stem abundance, basal area, stem size, and canopy height were all lowest on the RT among the three road positions. Species richness and abundance of midstorey and canopy trees were higher on the UE than on the DE. The mean stem size was higher on the DE than the UE, but no significant difference existed in canopy height on the two road edges. The different road positions were characterized by varied species assemblages. Indicator species analysis further indicated that 76.9%, 15.4% and 7.7% of the species showed affinity to UE, DE, and RT, respectively. The RT had more small-seeds but less soft-wood trees than the two road edges. The UE and DE had no significant difference in tree seed class distribution.

These patterns are especially pronounced in ecosystems that are under anthropogenic influence. Due to human-induced disturbances such as logging and deforestation, tropical forests comprise such a system. To date, most studies have dealt with ecological responses at the community level relative to forest disturbance or degradation. However, the evolutionary consequences of tropical forest deterioration on behaviour and functional morphology have received far less attention compared to temporal regions. From a resource-point of view, light conditions are essential for heliotherms such as butterflies. Because degradation of tropical cloud forests in the Taita Hills (Kenya) is very pronounced, the present study tested whether this induced changes in mate-location strategies, habitat-use, and functional flight morphology in a forest butterfly, Salamis parhassus. According to predictions from temperate regions, it was hypothesized that the species would change its mate location strategy from perching to patrolling in more disturbed forests, that this higher mobility results in a faster occupancy of light gaps, and that it accords with a higher wing loading within populations from undisturbed forests. These hypotheses were confirmed by field surveys and experiments. The present study demonstrates that degradation of tropical forests does not only affect communities (e.g. species richness), but also the behaviour and functional morphology of individual species. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London.","Cloud forests; Habitat fragmentation; Movement; Plasticity; Resource; Salamis parhassus","Bonte, D.; Terrestrial Ecology Unit, K.L.

Most of the measurements began at least 10 months before logging and continued at least 36 months after logging. The logging removed ∼15% of the trees with Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) greater than 35 cm, which resulted in an instantaneous 10% reduction in AGLB. Both wood production and mortality increased following logging, while Gross Primary Production (GPP) was unchanged. The ratio of wood production to GPP (the wood Carbon Use Efficiency or wood CUE) more than doubled following logging. Small trees (10 cm < DBH < 35 cm) accounted for most of the enhanced wood production. Medium trees (35 cm < DBH < 55 cm) that were within 30 m of canopy gaps created by the logging also showed increased growth. The patterns of enhanced growth are most consistent with logging-induced increases in light availability. The AGLB continued to decline over the study, as mortality outpaced wood production. Wood CUE and mortality remained elevated throughout the 3 years of postlogging measurements. The future trajectory of AGLB and the forest's carbon balance are uncertain, and will depend on how long it takes for heterotrophic respiration, mortality, and CUE to return to prelogging levels.

These disturbances alter the structure of the forest ecosystem and consequently its carbon budget. We analysed the role of fine root dynamics in the soil carbon budget of tropical moist forests in South-east Asia along a gradient of increasing disturbance intensity. Fine root production, fine root turnover, and the associated carbon fluxes from the fine root system to the soil were estimated with three different approaches in five stands ranging from an old growth forest with negligible anthropogenic disturbance to a cacao agroforestry system with planted shade trees. Annual fine root production and mortality in three natural forest sites with increasing canopy openness decreased continuously with increasing forest disturbance, with a reduction of more than 45% between the undisturbed forest and the forest with large timber extraction. Cacao agroforestry stands had higher fine root production and mortality rates than forest with large timber extraction but less than undisturbed forest. The amount of carbon annually transferred to the soil carbon pool through fine root mortality was highest in the undisturbed forest and generally decreased with increasing forest use intensity. However, root-related C flux was also relatively high in the plantation with planted shading trees. In contrast, the relative importance of C transfer from root death in the total above- and below-ground C input to the soil increased with increasing forest use intensity and was even similar to the C input via leaf litter fall in the more intensively managed agroforest. We conclude that moderate to heavy disturbance in South-east Asian tropical moist forests has a profound impact on fine root turnover and the related carbon transfer to the soil. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Resource availability is influenced by the number of competing trees and by lianas that often reach high densities in disturbed parts of tropical forests. The distance between conspecific trees affects pollination efficiency and seed predation intensity, and may therefore indirectly affect the long-term sustainability of selective logging. Here we investigate how reproductive status and the number of seeds dispersed per tree are affected by liana load, distance to the nearest conspecifics, number of competing neighbours and tree diameter in the timber trees Cariniana ianeirensis and Terminalia oblonga. The study is based on a large-scale silvicultural experiment in lowland Bolivia. We found that the reproductive status of the two species was negatively correlated with liana cover and positively with tree diameter. In C. ianeirensis the most liana-infested trees dispersed fewer seeds. In T. oblonga the intensity of pre-dispersal seed predation decreased with distance to the nearest conspecifics. There was no evidence that seed viability or seed production decreased with distance to nearest conspecifics in either species as would be expected if isolation resulted in increased self-pollination. Our results indicate that reproduction can be severely reduced in timber trees if the largest, most healthy and least liana-covered trees are logged, but that liana cutting on the remaining seed trees can considerably improve seed production. In some species seed production may be further improved by ensuring that seed trees are located far apart. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Certification has been promoted to enhance forest management in countries where governance capacities are insufficient to adequately manage natural resources and enforce pertinent regulations, given that certification relies largely on non-governmental organisations and private businesses. However, at present there are few tropical countries with large areas of certified forests. In this study, we conducted semi-structured stakeholder interviews in Ecuador and Bolivia to identify key framework conditions that influence the costs and benefits for companies to switch from conventional to certified forestry operations. Bolivia has a much greater relative area under certified forest management than Ecuador and also significantly more certified producers. The difference in the success of certification between both countries is particularly notable because Bolivia is a poorer country with more widespread corruption, and is landlocked with less access to export routes. Despite these factors, several characteristics of the Bolivian forest industry contribute to lower additional costs of certified forest management compared to Ecuador. Bolivia has stronger government enforcement of forestry regulations a fact that increases the cost of illegal logging, management units are larger, and vertical integration in the process chain from timber extraction to markets is higher. Moreover, forestry laws in Bolivia are highly compatible with certification requirements, and the government provides significant tax benefits to certified producers. Results from this study suggest that certification can be successful in countries where governments have limited governance capacity. However, the economic incentives for certification do not only arise from favourable market conditions. Certification is likely to be more successful where governments enforce forestry laws, provide financial incentives for certified forestry, and provide land tenure security, and where large-scale and vertically integrated forestry operations are commercially feasible. For this reason, at present, there are few developing countries where forest certification is likely to achieve widespread success. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about the effects of more gradual changes in forest structure and at regional scales. We studied land use types ranging from natural forest over selectively-logged forest to cacao agroforest in a lower montane region in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, and tested the suitability of high-resolution optical satellite imagery for modeling observed interception patterns. Investigated characteristics indicating canopy structure were mean and standard deviation of reflectance values, local maxima, and self-similarity measures based on the grey level co-occurrence matrix and geostatistical variogram analysis. Previously studied and published rainfall interception data comprised twelve plots and median values per land use type ranged from 30% in natural forest to 18% in cacao agroforests. A linear regression model with local maxima, mean contrast and normalized digital vegetation index (NDVI) as regressors was able to explain more than 84% (Radj2) of the variation encountered in the data. Other investigated characteristics did not prove significant in the regression analysis. The model yielded stable results with respect to cross-validation and also produced realistic values and spatial patterns when applied at the landscape level (783.6 ha). High values of interception were rare and localized in natural forest stands distant to villages, whereas low interception characterized the intensively used sites close to settlements. We conclude that forest use intensity significantly reduced rainfall interception and satellite image analysis can successfully be applied for its regional prediction, and most forest in the study region has already been subject to human-induced structural changes. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Shorea leprosula is a diploid and predominantly outcrossed species, whereas Shorea ovalis ssp. sericea is an autotetraploid species with apomictic mode of reproduction. Direct comparison of adjacent natural and logged-over stands showed reduction of genetic diversity of S. leprosula, but not of S. ovalis ssp. sericea. These results clearly demonstrated that a single logging event would cause the genetic erosion of S. leprosula. However, the apomictic mechanisms and the effects of tetrasomic inheritance of S. ovalis ssp. sericea might be a way of maintaining the level of genetic diversity. These results clearly implied that outcrossing species might be more susceptible to the negative impact of logging on genetic diversity than apomictic species. Simulation studies were conducted using three approaches: (1) simulated-removal of individuals based on diameter size classes; (2) simulated-removal of individuals at random; and (3) simulated-removal of individuals in clump. The simulation study based on the first approach showed that the loss of genetic diversity was higher for the Malayan Uniform System (MUS) compared with the Selective Management System (SMS). This might suggest that SMS is more orientated towards the conservation of genetic diversity. In addition, the simulation study showed that to conserve 100% of the total number of alleles, the tolerable cutting limits of S. leprosula in the 50-ha plot of Pasoh FR should be >85 cm diameter at breast height (dbh). Comparison of simulation studies based on the second and third approaches showed that the loss of genetic diversity was more rigorous if logging activities were anticipated through extraction of trees in clump rather than to extract trees at random. Implications of the studies for conserving and managing the tropical forests are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Contemporary deforestation continues an 8000 year process of transforming intact ecosystems into agroecosystems to supply humans with food and other products. Although only 88 of the 227 national respondents to the 2005 Food and Agricultural Organization's Forest Resource Assessment reported forest losses between 2000-05, over 8 million ha of valuable forest were lost, not only from biodiversity-rich tropical areas, but also from temperate and boreal forests. Moreover, some countries mask the loss of intact forests by considering monocrop plantations to be forest. Forest conversion and degradation are caused by the interaction of local, national, and international actors who seek benefits from logging, agricultural expansion, and forest product extraction. At the local level, although small-scale subsistence and commercial farmers convert and degrade forests, large-scale operators cause most forest loss through logging and agricultural projects. National policies promoting development and ignoring systemic corruption continue to encourage and reward these large projects, despite token accommodations to environmentalist pressures. Until the 1980s, bilateral and multilateral international development agencies blatantly promoted tropical forest conversion to 'more productive' uses. Their recent incorporation of green criteria into their aid policies and their promotion of community-based management offer hope that deforestation will be stopped. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Contributing to the later and detrimental to the former, timber logging in the region has very low efficiency (only 16% in the production chain). Such timber extraction, often referred to as selective logging, has been claimed as a sustainable extractive industry, because the forest is said to restore itself through regenerative growth. But forest regeneration in the Amazon occurs naturally only in a very limited scale, resulting that large scale, low efficiency logging poses a big treat to the functional integrity of the biome, supplying to the market only a fraction of what it could if done differently. So, instead of extracting big centennial logs from the forests, the Amazonian Phoenix project proposes that large expanses of degraded lands be reforested using pioneer plants species from the forest itself. These plants have the capacity to heal gaps in the canopy, being able to grow and produce woody biomass in very extreme conditions. The idea is to mimic the regenerative dynamics of the natural ecosystem in short cycle agrosilvicultural production areas, utilizing a variety of technologies to transform raw fibers from these fast growth native plants into a variety of materials with high aggregated value. This communication presents the research on natural fibers by the Polymeric Composites Group within the Amazonian Phoenix Project. Sustainable technologies employing materials with good and responsible ecological footprints are important and necessary stimulus for a change in the destructive economical activities present in the Amazon frontiers. The relatively well established wood polymer composites technology, for example, is a good candidate solution. Two research and development fields are proposed: the first one considers production systems with simple and cheap machinery, to facilitate technology assimilation by rural communities in the Amazon. The second one aims at developing composite materials with advanced production technology, like profile and sheet extrusion and injection molding. The source of the fibers would be both the short cycle agrosilviculture with softwood species, on already deforested lands, and the hardwood residues from operating sawmills. Preliminary results show that softwood fibers act as potentially important reinforcement for synthetic plastics. © 2009 by the authors.","Amazonian forest; Native plant fibers; Polymer-wood composites","Nobre, A.D.; Escritório Regional do INPA no INPE Sigma, Avenida dos Astronautas, 1758, CEP12227-010, São José dos Campos, SP, Brazil; email: anobre@ltid.inpe.br",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650223616

It also outlines some challenges, as well as opportunities, for integrating tropical forest management into climate-change adaptation more broadly. In addition to the use of reduced-impact logging to maintain ecosystem integrity, other approaches, such as fire prevention and management as well as specific silvicultural options aimed at facilitating genetic adaptation, may be needed. The normally higher intensity of management in tree plantations (compared to natural forests) offers additional opportunities for implementing adaptation measures at both the industrial and smallholder level. Although the integration of measures aimed at enhancing adaptation to climate change may not involve subs-tantial deviations from current practices, little action appears to have been taken on the ground. Up to what point have forestry research and national policies promoted the adoption of management practices (many of which do not need much additional investigation) that assist exploited forests adapt to climate change?

Location South-western Sri Lanka. Methods The land-snail fauna was sampled using standardized belt transects. Fifty-seven transects were sampled in 21 lowland rain forest fragments (c. 1-33,000 ha). The spatial arrangement of fragments in the study area was explicitly considered in an effort to take into account the non-random nature of fragmentation and degradation and the possibility that current species composition may reflect patterns of species turnover that existed prior to fragmentation. The data set of 57 land-snail species and 28 environmental and spatial variables was analysed using canonical correspondence analysis and partial canonical correspondence analysis. Results Fragment age, mean shape complexity (i.e. a landscape-scale measure of shape complexity), altitude, and the spatial variables x (longitude), y (latitude) and y2 explained significant variation in land-snail species composition. None of the three nominal variables quantifying habitat degradation was significantly correlated with variation in species composition. The independent effects of fragment age and mean shape complexity were similar. The combined effect of the spatial variables alone was larger than the independent effects of fragment age, mean shape complexity or altitude, but was of the same order of magnitude. The total variation explained by the spatial variables was comparable to the total non-spatial variation accounted for by fragment age, mean shape complexity and altitude. Main conclusions Fragment age was found to be one of only two key determinants (the other was shape complexity at the landscape scale) driving fragmentation-related changes in community composition. The influence of pre-fragmentation patterns of species turnover on assemblage structure can be stronger than the effects of fragmentation measures, such as age, and may override the effects of forest degradation. Thus, strong patterns of pre-existing turnover may potentially confound interpretation of the effects of forest fragmentation and degradation. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Assemblage composition; Degradation; Fragment age; Habitat fragmentation; Land snails; Shape complexity; Spatial heterogeneity; Species turnover; Sri Lanka; Tropical rain forest","Raheem, D.

Soil bacteria, as a part of the soil microbial community, may contribute to plant growth by mineral solubilization (Derylo and Skorupska 1992), nitrogen fixation (Albrecht et al. 1981), producing plant growth hormones (Neitko and Frankenberg 1989) and supressing plant pathogens (Handman et al. 1991). If an ecosystem is subjected to a degrading impact, the soil bacterial community may then change (Frostegård et al. 1993). Deforestation caused by logging and other human activities is a serious environmental issue in the tropics. The land deprived of the original tropical forest degrades rapidly under tropical climatic conditions (Eden and Parry 1996). The land degradation results in a hard to-rehabilitate soil conditions. In such a degraded soil, the soil bacterial community profile may differ from the original one (Doi and Sakurai 2003), often accompanied by crippled soil microbial functions (Doi 2004; Jha et al. 1992; Pérez-de-Mora et al. 2006). Thus, changes in soil bacterial community profile following the elimination of a tropical vegetative type warn us of ongoing degradation of the soil ecosystem. Methods for soil microbial community profiling have been developing (Kirk et al. 2004). Changes in soil quality can be detected by observing soil microbial aspects: fungal (Cuenca and Meneses 1996) and bacterial (Doi and Sakurai 2003) community structures, soil physiological functions (Biolog method, Garland and Mills 1991), and the distribution of biotic molecules such as respiratory quinines (Fujie et al. 1998), phospholipid fatty acids (Tunlid and White 1992), and nucleic acids (Yang et al. 2001). Profiling soil bacterial community may unveil a unique aspect of differences among soils, because the soil bacterial community profile may responds to a particular impact in a uniquely different way from the fungal community profile (Wu et al. 2008) or the physico-chemical profile (Doi and Sakurai 2003). Soil bacterial community profiles are available with the Biolog method (Garland and Mills 1991), amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis fingerprinting of 16S rDNA fragments (Wu et al. 2008) or counting bacterial cells that utilize single carbon sources (Doi and Sakurai 2003). We can obtain soil bacterial community profiles by testing soil bacterial isolates' resistance patterns to single antibiotics (Brönstad et al. 1996; Doyle and Stotzky 1993; Westover et al. 1997). The insight offered by these authors is that we would be able to obtain the soil bacterial community profile by counting the number of soil bacterial cells resistant to each of multiple antibiotics. Doi (2004) tested this possibility applying the antibiotic resistance most probable number (MPN) method to soils sampled at a forest and bare ground as a result of deforestation and subsequent human activities. Then, the MPN method could discriminate the soils. The discriminatory power was comparable (Doi 2004; Doi et al. 2004) to the Biolog method (Garland and Mills 1991). However, the soils profiled in their previous work were the extremes in the area, the most fertile forest soil and the most degraded bare ground soil (Doi and Sakurai 2004). Changes in soil microbial community profile responding any impacts are gradual, not abrupt (Frostegård et al. 1993). We were not sure how much the antibiotic resistance MPN method describes such gradual changes in soil bacterial community profile. Thus, in this research, we tried to describe a land degradation gradient with principal components derived from data sets on antibiotic resistance profiles of soil bacterial communities over a land degradation gradient as a result of deforestation in the Sakaerat Environmental Research Station, Thailand. The antibiotic MPN method was applied in finding the impacts of land degradation on soil bacterial community profile. We tried to describe the land degradation based on differences among the antibiotic resistance profiles. We also explored relationships between soil physico-chemical characteristics and the changes in antibiotic resistance profile. The most significant soil environmental changes related to changes in the antibiotic resistance profile of soil bacterial community were then specified.",,"Sakaerat Environmental Research Station, Udom Sap, Wang Nam Khieo, Nakhon Ratchasima Province 30370, Thailand",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73649139550

Nonetheless, tropical monodominance should be defined as >60%, rather than >50% of the tree species, co-occur in matrices of high-diversity, mixed rain forest. Several alternative mechanisms could produce this pattern, but one frequently cited observation is that most tropical monodominant trees form ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations. The majority of other trees in mixed rain forest form arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations, suggesting that ECM associations provide advantages to their monodominant trees; however, the mechanisms underlying this hypothesis have not been fully explored. This chapter will explore recent research in the tropical forests that has revealed evidence for positive feedbacks between ECM fungi, ECM monodominant trees and con-specific ECM seedlings. These positive feedbacks provide advantages to the ECM hosts that are not observed with AM and non-mycorrhizal trees. These advantages include linkages of seedlings to common ECM networks and interactions between ECM fungi and other saprotrophic microorganisms in forest soil that provide the ECM host with preferential access to limiting soil nutrients. These positive-feedback mechanisms may explain the local monodominance of an ECM tree species within the matrix of a typical high-diversity, predominantly AM rain forest community. Since tropical rain forests are currently threatened by human activities such as logging, development and industrial agriculture, understanding how mycorrhizal fungi function in maintaining tree diversity patterns is critical for managing and restoring these valuable ecosystems. © 2008 Springer Netherlands.","Dicymbe corymbosa; Ectomycorrhiza; Monodominance; Mycorrhizal fungi; Tropical rain forest","McGuire, K.L.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, , Irvine CA 92697, United States",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42549101345

The model was developed to investigate the impact of felling (logging) on the demography and structure of tree populations in tropical forests (French Guiana). This study addressed questions about (1) the relative impact on model predictions of uncertainty in mortality processes at different stages of tree development; (2) the interactions between the mortality processes and different felling regimes; and (3) the impact of different felling regimes on the demography and structure of tree populations, taking account of answers to (1) and (2). A global approach of sensitivity analysis based on the decomposition of the output variance was applied. Based on prior knowledge about model uncertainties, mortality processes at the stages germinated seed, standing juvenile, standing adult, and tree-fall were focused as input factors. The input factors were multivariate mortality sub-models involving several parameters with no explicit biological meaning. Thus, an approach based on confidence ellipses of parameter estimates was used to vary input factors homogenously, so that the impact of different input factors on a given model output could be compared. As outputs, the numbers of living, dead and recruited trees, and the tree diameter structure were analysed over 336 years of simulation. An additional local sensitivity analysis provided deeper insights into the relationships between model input and output. The results showed that standing juvenile mortality was the largest source of uncertainty, ahead of standing adult mortality, germinated seed mortality and tree-fall. Moreover, mainly standing juvenile mortality interacted with the felling regime, resulting in changes of the diameter structure of the studied tree population (Dicorynia guianensis Amshoff, Caesalpiniaceae). Felling all trees ≥60 cm diameter of that population every 42 or 84 years was found not sustainable in the long term. But enhancing the description of standing juvenile mortality may alter these predictions. As major conclusions, (i) standing mortality at the juvenile stage should be modelled thoroughly to ensure reliable long-term predictions, and (ii) the interaction of standing juvenile mortality and the felling regime may be an important relationship to be considered in the evaluation of the sustainability of felling regimes. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper discusses how tropical forestry practices can contribute to maintaining or enhancing the adaptive capacity of natural and planted forests to global climate change and considers challenges and opportunities for the integration of tropical forest management in broader climate change adaptation. In addition to the use of reduced impact logging to maintain ecosystem integrity, other approaches may be needed, such as fire prevention and management, as well as specific silvicultural options aimed at facilitating genetic adaptation. In the case of planted forests, the normally higher intensity of management (with respect to natural forest) offers additional opportunities for implementing adaptation measures, at both industrial and smallholder levels. Although the integration in forest management of measures aimed at enhancing adaptation to climate change may not involve substantial additional effort with respect to current practice, little action appears to have been taken to date. Tropical foresters and forest-dependent communities appear not to appreciate the risks posed by climate change and, for those who are aware of them, practical guidance on how to respond is largely non-existent. The extent to which forestry research and national policies will promote and adopt management practices in order to assist production forests adapt to climate change is currently uncertain.

To understand the ecological impacts of selective logging it is therefore necessary to explore how patterns of tree species composition are affected by this patchy disturbance. This study examines the impacts of selective logging on species composition and spatial patterns of vegetation structure and tree diversity in Sabah, Borneo. We compare tree diversity between logged and unlogged forest at three scales: species richness within plots, species turnover among plots, and total species richness and composition of plots combined. Logging had no effect on tree diversity measured at the smallest scale. Logged forest had a greater rate of species turnover with distance, so at a large spatial scale it supported more tree species than the relatively homogeneous unlogged area. Tree species composition also differed significantly between the two types of forest, with more small dipterocarps and large pioneers in logged forest, and more large dipterocarps in unlogged forest. Our results emphasize the importance of sampling at a sufficiently large scale to represent patterns of biodiversity within tropical forest landscapes.

Although none of the components of RIL are new, concerns about destructive logging practices and worker safety in the tropics stimulated this recent proliferation of semi-coordinated research and training activities related to timber harvesting. Studies in Southeast Asia, Africa, and South and Central America have clearly documented that the undesired impacts of selective logging on residual stands and soils can be substantially reduced through implementation of a series of recommended logging practices by crews that are appropriately trained, supervised, and compensated. Whether reducing the deleterious impacts of logging also reduces profits seems to depend on site conditions (e.g., terrain, soil trafficability, and riparian areas), whether the profits from illegal activities are included in the baseline, and the perspective from which the economic calculations are made. A standardized approach for calculating logging costs using RILSIM software is advocated to facilitate comparisons and to allow uncoupling RIL practices to evaluate their individual financial costs and benefits. Further complicating the matter is that while there are elements common to all RIL guidelines (e.g., directional felling), other components vary (e.g., slope limits of 17-40° with ground-based yarding). While use of RIL techniques may be considered as a prerequisite for sustaining timber yields (STY), in particular, and sustainable forest management (SFM), in general, RIL should not be confounded with STY and SFM. This confusion is particularly problematic in forests managed for light-demanding species that benefit from both canopy opening and mineral soil exposure as well as where harvesting intensities are high and controlled primarily by minimum diameter cutting limits. These qualifications notwithstanding, since logging is the most intensive of silvicultural treatments in most tropical forests managed for timber, some aspects of RIL are critical (e.g., protection of water courses) whether forests are managed for STY, SFM, or even replacement by agricultural crops. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It is praised as a more equitable strategy of satisfying the demands from multiple stakeholders, an ecologically more benign harvesting approach, and a way of adding more value to forests making them more robust to conversion. MFM thus represents a common and prime management objective under the sustainable forest management (SFM) paradigm. However, its implementation has been lagging behind the expectations, particularly in the tropics. In this paper, we analyze selected MFM implementation examples to try to explain why. We scrutinize the tropical forestry debate to find that the meaning of MFM has undergone significant changes along the way, and that the topic depends heavily on the scale of inspection. Also, we examine the conditions that either favor or constrain MFM adoption. At the local scale, the factors that set the scene for multiple-use approaches to be successfully adopted are favorable governance conditions relate to land-devolution policies, effective collective institutions, and multi-agent forest-management models. MFM feasibility also depends on the stage of forest transition, i.e. in society's economic development. MFM (at the stand level) dominates in poor subsistence-oriented autarchic forest settings, it typically declines when entering capitalist stages of specialized commodity production, but may then rebound (at the landscape level) in more advanced development stages. Key factors MFM generally is up against range from intricate technical trade-offs to the economies of scale in forestry production and marketing. MFM remains a valid management alternative under specifically favorable local context conditions, especially when practiced at the landscape scale, but these conditions are less frequent than commonly assumed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Corollary to this general rule is that most tree species, whether valued for timber or not, occur at low densities (&lt;1 adult tree ha-1) or may be locally rare. In the Brazilian Amazon, many of the most highly valued timber species occur at extremely low densities yet are intensively harvested with little regard for impacts on population structures and dynamics. These include big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), ipê (Tabebuia serratifolia and Tabebuia impetiginosa), jatobá (Hymenaea courbaril), and freijó cinza (Cordia goeldiana). Brazilian forest regulations prohibit harvests of species that meet the legal definition of rare - fewer than three trees per 100 ha - but treat all species populations exceeding this density threshold equally. In this paper we simulate logging impacts on a group of timber species occurring at low densities that are widely distributed across eastern and southern Amazonia, based on field data collected at four research sites since 1997, asking: under current Brazilian forest legislation, what are the prospects for second harvests on 30-year cutting cycles given observed population structures, growth, and mortality rates? Ecologically 'rare' species constitute majorities in commercial species assemblages in all but one of the seven large-scale inventories we analyzed from sites spanning the Amazon (range 49-100% of total commercial species). Although densities of only six of 37 study species populations met the Brazilian legal definition of a rare species, timber stocks of five of the six timber species declined substantially at all sites between first and second harvests in simulations based on legally allowable harvest intensities. Reducing species-level harvest intensity by increasing minimum felling diameters or increasing seed tree retention levels improved prospects for second harvests of those populations with a relatively high proportion of submerchantable stems, but did not dramatically improve projections for populations with relatively flat diameter distributions. We argue that restrictions on logging very low-density timber tree populations, such as the current Brazilian standard, provide inadequate minimum protection for vulnerable species. Population declines, even if reduced-impact logging (RIL) is eventually adopted uniformly, can be anticipated for a large pool of high-value timber species unless harvest intensities are adapted to timber species population ecology, and silvicultural treatments are adopted to remedy poor natural stocking in logged stands. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In many countries, questions are raised on whether tropical forests should be publicly, commonly or privately owned and managed in order to enhance sustainability. Other debates also focus on whether small-scale enterprises are better positioned than large-scale industrial concessions to reduce poverty and attain sustainable management. In countries where large tracts of forest are state-owned, concessions are viewed as a means of delivering services of public and collective interest through an association of private investment and public regulation. However, the success of an industrial concession model in countries with large forest resource endowment to achieve multiple goals such as sustainable forest management and local/regional development depends on two critical assumptions. First, forest functions and services should be managed and maintained as public goods. In many cases, additional uses - and corresponding rights - can take place alongside logging activities. Industrial concessions can be more efficient than other tenure models (such as community-based forest management and small-scale enterprises) in achieving SFM, add value to raw material and comply with growing environmental norms. This is especially the case in market-remote areas with low population density and poor infrastructure. Secondly, to achieve these different outcomes, any concession system needs to be monitored and regulated, especially in contexts dominated by asymmetrical information between regulating authorities and concessionaires. New institutional responses have recently been put forward in several countries, providing valuable materials to design a renewed policy mix which associates public and private incentives. This paper provides a survey of the experience of forest concessions in several Central African and South American countries. The concession system is examined in order to clarify the issues involved, the problems encountered, and what can be learned from the shared experience of these countries in the last decade. This paper argues that despite a sometimes patchy record, concessions can help promote SFM so long as they are packaged with a certain number of specific measures. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Tree regeneration requirements and forest stand responses to harvesting are often ignored, and consequently, the regeneration of the residual forest is not ensured. We developed and tested an alternative approach to tree selection, where seed trees were retained as a proportion of harvestable trees, with the proportion defined as a function of species' ecological attributes and local abundance (100 ha), in contrast to the conventional approach which retained 10% of harvestable trees, uniformly across commercial species at the compartmental scale (1000 ha). The study was conducted in Democracia Project, a forest management operation in Amazonas, Brazil. The conventional approach failed to retain any seed trees at the 100 ha block scale for 7 of 37 commercial species, whereas the alternative approach retained a minimum number of seed trees per 100 ha block for all commercial species. The conventional approach resulted in the retention of relatively high proportions of potential seed trees for common species (e.g., 22% for Eperua oleifera and 36% for Maquira sclerophila) that are shade bearers and recruit readily at the site; alternately, for species with constraints to regeneration, it retained relatively low proportions (e.g., 2% for Dinizia excelsa and Hymenolobium nitidum). The alternative approach effectively retained lower proportions of common species (e.g., 10% for E. oleifera and 13% for M. sclerophila) and relatively high proportions of species with regeneration constraints (e.g., 20% for D. excelsa and 16% for H. nitidum). Our study demonstrates that it is feasible to implement at an operational scale, species-specific retention rules that take into account local abundance when inventory data are digitised and spatially explicit. Monitoring regeneration in the residual stands over time will provide the evidence to assess the ecological benefits of the adoption of our alternative approach. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In both localities, timber is harvested via reduced-impact logging (RIL) practices. In Guatemala, the main NTFP extracted is foliage from the understory xate palm (Chamaedorea spp.); in northern Bolivia, the fruits of the Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa). The Guatemalan case suggests a relatively high degree of compatibility due to low timber harvesting intensities, coupled with temporal, spatial, and social segregation of xate extraction in a well-defined land tenure system. In northern Bolivia, forest management regulations pay little attention to NTFPs and land tenure issues and related conflict complicate efforts to limit timber harvesting impacts on Brazil nut trees. The introduction of timber management plans overlain on customary property rights systems in which the extraction of Brazil nut is organized could undercut its management system. The two case studies suggest that specific legislative, education, and project interventions may help to promote the compatibility of timber and NTFP extraction and management. These include formal training of foresters on NTFP ecology and management while taking into account the perspectives of multiple stakeholders in the design of management plans. Tropical forest users, research managers, and policy makers will also better understand the need for integrated management of timber and NTFPs, if the trade-offs and potential economic benefits from NTFP extraction are clarified. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, these techniques do not necessarily ameliorate the low growth rates of many commercial species or otherwise assure recovery of the initial volume harvested during the next cutting cycle. In this study, we analyze the effect of logging and application of additional silvicultural treatments (liana cutting and girdling of competing trees) on the growth rates on trees in general and on of future crop trees (FCTs) of 24 commercial timber species. The study was carried out in a moist tropical forest in Bolivia, where we monitored twelve 27-ha plots for 4 years. Plots received one of four treatments in which logging intensity and silvicultural treatments were varied: control (no logging); normal (reduced-impact) logging; normal logging and low-intensity silviculture; and, increased logging intensity and high-intensity silviculture. Tree growth rates increased with intensity of logging and silvicultural treatments. The growth rates of FCTs of commercial species were 50-60% higher in plots that received silvicultural treatments than in the normal logging and control plots. Responses to silvicultural treatments varied among functional groups. The largest increase in growth rates was observed in FCTs belonging to the partially shade-tolerant and the shade-tolerant groups. These results indicate that silvicultural treatments, in addition to the use of RIL techniques, are more likely to result in a higher percentage of timber volume being recovered after the first cutting cycle than RIL alone. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Malaysian Sarawak, like other areas in Southeast Asia, is the target of international criticism for commercial logging that causes deforestation and destroys native people's livelihood. In fact, Sarawak still maintains a large portion of forested area and deforestation is not rapid compared to other areas in Southeast Asia. Abuse of minority people, who depend on the forests, through logging and development projects, is also commonly found in Southeast Asia. Therefore, it seems that commercial logging in Sarawak has been among the most criticized in Southeast Asia not only because of its environment impact, but also because of Sarawak's social and political framework. This article examines the socio-political structure in relation to forest resources in Sarawak and considers recent changes in both NGO and government policy. Since the late 1980s, the Penan, a native people in the Upper Baram and Limban river basin, have blockaded logging roads to protest commercial logging. This movement attracted the commitment of foreign environmental activists to the international anti-logging campaign. Domestic NGOs alone were not powerful and easily suppressed by the government. The urban middle class is divided into ethnic clusters. Therefore, environmental degradation and the thread to Penan's livelihood caused by the commercial logging did not become a public issue in Sarawak, and the Penan had to rely on foreign activists. Recently some changes are apparent. In the 1990s, the Sarawak government introduced a ""Sustainable Forest Management"" policy, including application for MTCC timber certification that actually started in 2002. NGOs and the native people's movement have shifted from physical methods, such as blockades, to waging legal battles, and more local NGOs are assisting native people. A major issue is still the government policy that does not recognize native customary rights in the natural forests. But it is also necessary to find temporary and practical solutions to improve native livelihood. For that purpose, persistent dialogue among all concerned should be continued.","Forest certification; Forestry; Politics; Sarawak; Sustainable forest management","Wataru, F.; Faculty of Letters, 6-2-23 Morikita, Higashinada-ku, Kobe 658-0001, Japan; email: watarufujita@yahoo.co.jp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149488845

Although fuelwood extraction (even low intensities) might strongly impact the structure and species composition of natural forests, long-term studies remain scarce. Here, we estimate the potential long-term impacts (over several hundred years) of such repeated harvesting of single trees on tropical montane cloud forest in central Veracruz, Mexico, by applying a process-based forest growth model. We simulate a wide range of possible harvesting scenarios differing in wood volume harvested and preferred tree species and sizes, and use a set of indicators to compare their impacts on forest size structure and community composition. Results showed that the overall impact on forest structure and community composition increased linearly with the amount of harvested wood volume. Even at low levels of harvesting, forest size structure became more homogeneous in the long term because large old trees disappeared from the forest, but these changes might take decades or even centuries. Although recruitment of harvested species benefited from harvesting, species composition shifted to tree species that are not used for fuelwood. Our results demonstrate that fuelwood extraction can have marked long-term impacts on tropical montane cloud forests. The results also offer the possibility to support the design of management strategies for the natural species-rich forests that achieve a balance between economic needs and ecological goals of the stakeholders. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Disturbance; Ecosystem dynamics; Fire wood; Forest model; FORMIND; Logging impacts; Mexico; Selective logging; Sustainable forest management; Tropical montane cloud forest","Rüger, N.; Department Ecological Modelling (OESA), Permoserstr. 15, Leipzig 04318, Germany; email: nadja.rueger@ufz.de",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52949153573

To understand the impact of forest logging on the habitat use of primates in temperate mixed forest, we compared the range, habitat used, population size, and diet of a troop (ERT) of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) in the Qinling Mountains before (1989), during (1997), and after (2002-2003) commercial logging. Logging significantly changed the composition of the forest and the food supply for the troop. Some areas were heavily logged and formed patches in the forest that lacked canopy cover. The troop moved 7 km away from their original range when logging took place and returned to their original range after logging stopped, but they avoided heavily logged areas that lacked canopy cover. Their movement indicated some degree of site fidelity in this species. Diet and home range changed after logging, but the population size remained stable, which suggests that this species has some ability to adapt to habitat changes. Our results may reflect a natural flexibility in primates to adapt to the changing food resources in temperate areas with marked seasonal variations in food availability and distribution.

One of the biggest difficulties for ecologically sustainable management of tropical forests is obtaining reliable growth data for trees, which is a prerequisite for determining harvesting volumes and cutting cycles. GOL is the first concept for sustainable management of tropical timber resources in Amazonian floodplain forests (várzea) based on species-specific management criteria, such as minimum logging diameters (MLDs) and cutting cycles. From timber species with varying wood densities of different successional stages, volume stocks have been estimated in 1-ha plots and 12 growth models have been developed based on tree rings, which are annually formed as a consequence of the regular, long-term flooding. The MLDs of timber species vary between 47 and 70 cm and the estimated cutting cycles differ the 10-fold, from 3 to 32 years. These enormous differences in the growth rates between tropical timber species are not considered in current management practices, which apply only one diameter cutting limit and one cutting cycle to harvest many tree species. This practice risks the overexploitation of slow-growing timber species, while the fast-growing timber species with low wood densities cannot be efficiently used. Based on the timber stocks and lifetime growth rates, the GOL concept has been created as an aid to improve forest management in the Central Amazonian várzea. The model is unique for tropical silviculture. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It is thus essential to predict it with a reliable precision. It can be predicted using the stock recovery formula or Usher matrix models, that are projection matrix models for size-structured populations. Both depend on estimates of vital rates, that are mortality rates, recruitment rates and upgrowth rates. The precision of estimation of the stock recovery rate is related to the amount of data available for the estimation of vital rates and to the type of estimator used. As data on tropical tree species are scarce, the choice of an appropriate estimator for vital rates is crucial. Classical estimators include the proportion estimator and estimators based on the conditional expectation of diameter increments. We show that the later are biased and define a correction that partially corrects this bias. In all, 14 estimators of the vital rates were compared in this study, to predict the stock recovery rate of Dicorynia guianensis, a major timber species in French Guiana. These estimators were compared on the basis of the prediction error, of the sensitivity of the stock recovery rate to diameter intervals, and of the bias and variance of the stock recovery rate estimator. The predicted stock recovery rate varied greatly depending on the estimator used for vital rates, with even contradictory conclusions as whether the stock depletes or increases. However some the estimators were strongly biased and gave unreliable estimates. Which estimator was the most statistically efficient depended on sample size. The proportion estimators had a small bias and a large variance and were efficient for large samples, whereas the estimators based on the conditional expectation of diameter increments had a large bias and a small variance and were efficient for small samples. The former were more sensitive to the diameter breakpoints than the latter. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We predicted that experimental canopy gaps would greatly enhance tree seedling recruitment, and that leaf litter removal would further enhance recruitment of small-seeded, shade-intolerant seedlings in gaps. We created a large (320-540 m2) gap in the center of 5 out of 10 40 m × 40 m experimental plots, and applied the following treatments bimonthly over a 14-month-period in a factorial, split-split plot design: clipping of understory vegetation (cut, uncut), and leaf litter manipulations (removal, addition, control). As expected, experimental gaps dramatically increased tree seedling recruitment, but gap effects varied among litter treatments. Litter addition reduced recruitment in gaps, but enhanced recruitment under intact canopy. Species composition of recruits also differed markedly between gap treatments: several small-seeded pioneer and long-lived pioneer species recruited almost exclusively in gaps. In contrast, a few medium-to-large-seeded shade-tolerant species recruited predominantly under intact canopy. Leaf litter represents a major barrier for seedling emergence and establishment of small-seeded, shade-intolerant species, but enhances emergence and establishment of large-seeded, shade-tolerant species, possibly through increased humidity and reduced detection by predators. Periodic clipping of the understory vegetation marginally reduced tree seedling mortality, but only in experimental gaps, where understory vegetation cover was greatly enhanced compared to intact canopy conditions. Successful regeneration of commercially valuable long-lived pioneer trees that dominate the forest canopy may require clear-cutting, as well as weeding and site preparation (litter removal) treatments in felling clearings. Management systems that mimic natural canopy gaps (reduced-impact selective logging) could favor the regeneration of shade-tolerant tree species, potentially accelerating convergence to old-growth forest composition. In contrast, systems that produce large canopy openings (clear-cutting) may re-initiate succession, potentially leading to less diverse but perhaps more easily managed ""natural plantations"" of long-lived pioneer tree species. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Both stocks and fluxes of necromass are infrequently measured. In this study, we directly measured the production of fallen coarse necromass (≥2 cm diameter) during 4.5 years using repeated surveys in undisturbed forest areas and in forests subjected to reduced-impact logging at the Tapajos National Forest, Belterra, Brazil (3.08° S, 54.94° W). We also measured fallen coarse necromass and standing dead stocks at two times during our study. The mean (SE) annual flux into the fallen coarse necromass pool in undisturbed forest of 6.7 (0.8) Mg·ha-1·yr-1 was not significantly different from the flux under a reduced-impact logging of 8.5 (1.3) Mg·ha-1·yr-1. With the assumption of steady state, the instantaneous decomposition constants for fallen necromass in undisturbed forests were 0.12 yr-1 for large, 0.33 yr-1 for medium, and 0.47 yr-1 for small size classes. The mass weighted decomposition constant was 0.15 yr-1 for all fallen coarse necromass. Standing dead wood had a residence time of 4.2 years, and ∼0.9 Mg·ha-1·yr-1 of this pool was respired annually to the atmosphere through decomposition. Coarse necromass decomposition at our study site accounted for 12% of total carbon re-mineralization, and total aboveground coarse necromass was 14% of the aboveground biomass. Use of mortality rates to calculate production of coarse necromass leads to an underestimation of coarse necromass production by 45%, suggesting that nonlethal disturbance such as branch fall contributes significantly to this flux. Coarse necromass production is an important component of the tropical forest carbon cycle that has been neglected in most previous studies or erroneously estimated. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Amazon; Coarse woody debris; Dead wood; Decay; Decomposition; Mortality; Necromass; Reduced-impact logging; Standing dead; Tropical forest","Palace, M.; Complex Systems Research Center, , Durham, NH 03824, United States; email: michael.palace@unh.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-50549102470

However, recent research indicates that this is not true for ipê (Tabebuia spp.), currently flooding the US residential decking market, much of it logged in Brazil. Uneven or non-application of minimum technical standards for certification could undermine added value and eventually the certification process itself. We examine public summary reports by third-party certifiers describing the evaluation process for certified companies in the Brazilian Amazon to determine the extent to which standards are uniformly applied and the degree to which third-party certifier requirements for compliance are consistent among properties. Current best-practice harvest systems, combined with Brazilian legal norms for harvest levels, guarantee that no certified company or community complies with FSC criteria and indicators specifying species-level management. No guidelines indicate which criteria and indicators must be enforced, or to what degree, for certification to be conferred by third-party assessors; nor do objective guidelines exist for evaluating compliance for criteria and indicators for which adequate scientific information is not yet available to identify acceptable levels. Meanwhile, certified companies are expected to monitor the long-term impacts of logging on biodiversity in addition to conducting best-practice forest management. This burden should reside elsewhere. We recommend a clarification of 'sustained timber yield' that reflects current state of knowledge and practice in Amazonia. Quantifiable verifiers for best-practice forest management must be developed and consistently employed. These will need to be flexible to reflect the diversity in forest structure and dynamics that prevails across this vast region.

In 3 East African tropical rainforests, we investigated the effect of different levels of local forest disturbance on the frugivore community and on tree visitation and fruit removal rates of the small-seeded tree Celtis durandii. We quantified birds and primates in little and heavily disturbed sites, distinguishing between forest specialists, forest generalists, and forest visitors. We quantified frugivorous tree visitors and seed removal rates of C. durandii trees in the same sites. Forest disturbance reduced the species richness and density of the frugivore community and of forest specialists. Frugivorous species and individuals visiting the study trees were reduced significantly, which led to a marginally significant decline in fruit removal by all frugivores and a significant reduction in removal by forest specialists. Reduction in fruit removal by forest specialists was not compensated for by increases in removal by forest generalists or visitors. Results did not differ among the 3 rainforests, which suggests they were consistent at a regional scale. So local forest disturbance led to a loss of frugivores and their seed removal services. This suggests that large-seeded tree species and trees with small fruits are losing seed dispersers. Thus, local forest disturbance appears to have a more general negative impact on frugivores and their seed dispersal services than anticipated previously. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.","Biodiversity; Birds; Celtis durandii; East Africa; Ecosystem function; Primates; Redundancy; Tropical rainforest","Böhning-Gaese, K.; Department of Ornithology, , Nairobi, Kenya; email: boehning@uni-mainz.de",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41849092274

CASA-3D has the following new features: (1) an alternative approach for calculating absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) using new high-resolution satellite images of forest canopy gap fraction; (2) a pulse disturbance module to modify aboveground carbon pools following forest disturbance; (3) a regrowth module that simulates changes in community composition by considering gap phase regeneration; and (4) a radiative transfer module to simulate the dynamic three-dimensional light environment above the canopy and within gaps after forest disturbance. The model was calibrated with and tested against field observations from experimental logging plots in the Large-scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) project. The sensitivity of key model parameters was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations, and the uncertainties in simulated NPP and respiration associated with model parameters and meteorological variables were assessed. We found that selective logging causes changes in forest architecture and composition that result in a cascading set of impacts on the carbon cycling of rainforest ecosystems. Our model sensitivity and uncertainty analyses also highlight the paramount importance of measuring changes in canopy gap fraction from satellite data, as well as canopy light-use efficiency from ecophysiological measurements, to understand the role of forest disturbance on landscape and regional carbon cycling in tropical forests. In sum, our study suggests that CASA-3D may be suitable for regional-scale applications to assess the large-scale effects of selective logging, to provide guidance for forest management, and to understand the role of forest disturbance in regional and global climate studies.

In this study we analyze the effects of three different sets of silvicultural treatments on the densities and growth rates of seedlings, saplings and poles of 23 commercial tree species in a moist tropical forest in Bolivia. The treatments vary in intensity of logging and silviculture application, and are compared to a control treatment. Silvicultural treatments applied were liberation of future crop trees from lianas and neighboring competing trees, soil scarification and stand refinements. Treatments were applied to twelve 27-ha plots. In each plot 4 transects were established to assess the density and growth of the regeneration of the 23 commercial species. Effects were measured 1 and 4 years after treatment application and were described using three ecological guilds; shade-tolerant species, partially shade-tolerant species, and long-lived pioneers. We found that the intensive silviculture treatment had the largest impact on the density and growth rates of the regeneration of the commercial species. Overall, the density of regeneration of the commercial species was higher in the control treatment than in the logged treatments 1 year after treatment application, but 3 years later these differences had disappeared. Nevertheless, there were marked shifts in densities when different size classes were considered. In nearly all treatments, the number seedlings decreased over time, while the number of saplings and poles increased. Overall shade-tolerant species were more abundant than the other two ecological guilds. Treatment had a positive effect on density only for long-lived pioneers. Growth of commercial tree regeneration was strongly affected by treatment and was highest in the intensive silvicultural treatment plots where growth of long-lived pioneers was twice that of shade-tolerant species and partial shade-tolerant species. Apart from silvicultural treatments and ecological guild, light availability had the strongest effect on growth rates. These results show that different silvicultural treatments have different effects on the regeneration of commercial tree species and that ecological guilds-specific treatments should be considered in management plans for sustainable timber production in tropical lowland forests. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In spite of the importance of these species, relatively little is known about their regeneration ecology and little effort has gone into understanding the reasons for the consistently reported regeneration failures after logging. I assessed seed survival to germination (Entandrophragma angolense) and seedling survivorship (E. cylindricum) in three different forest types - monodominant Gilbertiodendron, mixed species, and fallow forest - under three different treatments - control, small mesh chicken wire, and large mesh chicken wire - to evaluate the relative importance of different causes of mortality. All seeds were eaten in controls and in both exclosure treatments within Gilbertiodendron forest in a matter of days. Seed survivorship to germination within exclosures in mixed species and fallow forest increased by approximately 10 and 25%, respectively, compared to Gilbertiodendron forest. Six-month seedling survivorship in controls was 37, 12, and 9% in Gilbertiodendron, mixed species and fallow forest, respectively. Seedling mortality was due to different causes in each forest type. In Gilbertiodendron forest controls, an equivalent percentage of seedlings died due to fungal and insect attack (27 and 28%, respectively), while in mixed species forest controls 28 and 55% of seedlings died of these causes, respectively. In fallow forest controls, 48% of seedlings died from predation and/or uprooting by small mammals, all in the first few weeks post-sowing; insect attack (26%) and drought (13%) were other important causes of seedling deaths. Protecting seedlings with exclosures had a dramatic effect on seedling survivorship within the fallow forest, increasing to over 50%. Because of their exceptional value, out or enrichment planting of these species may be economically viable both as part of forest management and agroforestry systems.

Despite logging is still being carried out annually, Malaysia can still boast to be able to maintain and protect the environment through vast areas of forested land as Permanent Reserved Forest which account about 14.39 million ha or 43.8% of its total land area at the end of 2006. At the same time forestry sector's share of GDP is 1.10% in 2006, and has contributed significantly to the economic growth and development of Malaysia through foreign exchange, employment opportunities, industrial development and revenue to the State Governments. How does Malaysia achieve this? The answer is through Sustainable Forest Resource Management (SFM). SFM involves not only the continuous functions and services provided by forest but also about meeting the global concerns and expectations in managing the forest with greater emphasis on environmental protection and conservation of biological diversity. Subsequently forest certification was introduced as market incentive to improve the quality of forest management including protection of environment. In this connection, Malaysian Criteria and Indicators were also formulated to enhance social and environment aspects; compliance of the activities will be rewarded with certificate. To date, 8 timber producing states in Peninsular Malaysia have been awarded the certificate by Malaysian Timber Certification Council after being assessed by independent assessors. Issuance of forest management certification manifested itself our commitment towards sustainable forest management through the three pillars viz, economically viable, socially well-aware and environmentally sound. Thus, the practice of SFM by Forestry Department Malaysia has proven that in managing the forest resource we are also able to protect the environment.","Environmental protection; Forest certification; Forest harvesting; Sustainable forest management; Tropical forest resources","Jusoff, K.; Faculty of Forestry, , Serdang 43400 Selangor, Malaysia; email: kamaruz@putra.upm.edu.my",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46449102921

In this study, we present avifauna data collected from a monitoring programme in west-central Sumatra that set camera traps in three study areas with different habitat types, levels of degradation and protection status. From 5,990 camera trap-nights, 248 independent bird photographs were recorded, comprising four orders and nine species, including three endemic species. The Great Argus Pheasant (Argusianus argus) was recorded in all study areas and most frequently (n = 202 photographs), followed by the threatened Salvadori's Pheasant (Lophura inornata). The greatest diversity of bird species (five) and abundance index (1.44 bird photographs/100 trap-nights) was recorded from a primary hill-submontane forest site located inside Kerinci Seblat National Park (KSNP) bordering degraded forest in a former logging concession recently repatriated into KSNP. However, inside a primary-selectively logged hill-submontane forest site spread over KSNP and an ex-logging concession, a Sumatran Ground Cuckoo (Carpococcyx viridis) was photographed. This species is noteworthy because prior to this study it had only been documented once since 1916. It is therefore crucial to use the camera trap results to increase the protection status for the ground cuckoo area. This has already happened in the other two study areas, where camera trap data have been used to reclassify the areas as Core Zones, the highest level of protection inside KSNP.

Due to large scale forest harvesting in the past, most of the extant forests are post harvesting tropical montane rain forests, which have the greatest resources stock and distribution areas in Bawangling. The widespread distributed post harvesting tropical montane rain forest previously dominated by Dacridium pierrii was selected as the study object. The composition size, height structure and species diversity of different post harvested forest stands were studied. Comparison and analysis were made among the different post harvesting stands and their virgin old-growth stands. The results were as follows: Compared with the virgin stand, the dominance of middle or small trees and shrubs increased while the dominance of big trees decreased in the post harvested stands. The species richness, density and relative importance of shade intolerant trees increased with the increase of harvesting intensity or damage degree the forest experienced. The percentages of short and small trees increased while those of the tall and big trees decreased in the post harvested stands, especially canopy trees decreased with the increase of harvesting intensity or damage degree. Based on analysis on the change of some stand factors and in view of forest structure maintenance, it was concluded that the harvesting methods of cutting while tendering and cutting according to size classes were better than clear cutting and strong intensive cutting. The species richness in virgin stand was greater than those in the post harvested stands, while the Shannon-Weiner species diversity index and evenness index in the virgin stand were smaller than those in the post harvested stands. The post harvested stands formed by selective cutting were more similar in composition than the post harvested stands formed by clear cutting.","Community structure; Post harvested forest; Species diversity; Tropical forest","Yang, Y.-C.; Research Institute of Forest Resources Information Techniques, , Beijing 100091, China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049192733

In this study, we use computer simulations to examine the potential effects of forest logging on genetic diversity and demographic recovery (basal area development) of four neotropical tree species over a time frame reflecting multiple logging events. The study species, Bagassa guianensis Aubl., Hymenaea courbaril L., Manilkara huberi (Ducke) Chevalier, and Symphonia globulifera L.f., are all taxa which are commonly exploited for timber in the Brazilian Amazon. The simulations were parameterized using empirical data from field studies in the Tapajós National Forest, Pará State, Brazil, including genotypes at microsatellite loci, demography, ecology and growth for each species. Eight scenarios, combining two different cutting cycles and two minimum cutting diameters, were examined for each of the four species. The scenarios represent the actual forest practices used in Brazil and French Guiana (cutting diameter 45 and 60 cm, and cutting cycle of 30 and 65 years, respectively). Logging scenarios were applied for six cutting cycles, and final genetic and demographic data were compared to baseline data from corresponding control scenarios. At the end of the simulated period the basal area was strongly reduced under all conditions in B. guianensis, H. courbaril, and M. huberi. In only two scenarios was a species able to recover its basal area following logging (S. globulifera with both 45- and 60-cm cutting diameters under a 65-year cutting cycle). In the logging scenarios, all species showed a loss of alleles and genotypes and an increased genetic distance (calculated between each population at the start and the end of the simulations). These effects were higher under the most intensive logging cycles (30 years, 45 cm). However, effective number of alleles, expected and observed heterozygosities, and the fixation index were little affected by the logging simulations. Over all, we conclude that, even under very optimistic conditions for growth and recruitment, current logging practices are not sustainable in terms of basal area. Our simulations show that different species respond differently to logging, both demographically and genetically. No single set of logging parameters can be applied to the forest as a whole. Rather, forest management practices must be species-specific, taking into account not only growth parameters but also ecological and reproductive variables, in order to move toward long-term forest sustainability. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Here a carbon sequestration strategy is proposed in which certain dead or live trees are harvested via collection or selective cutting, then buried in trenches or stowed away in above-ground shelters. The largely anaerobic condition under a sufficiently thick layer of soil will prevent the decomposition of the buried wood. Because a large flux of CO2 is constantly being assimilated into the world's forests via photosynthesis, cutting off its return pathway to the atmosphere forms an effective carbon sink. It is estimated that a sustainable long-term carbon sequestration potential for wood burial is 10 ± 5 GtC y-1, and currently about 65 GtC is on the world's forest floors in the form of coarse woody debris suitable for burial. The potential is largest in tropical forests (4.2 GtC y-1), followed by temperate (3.7 GtC y-1) and boreal forests (2.1 GtC y-1). Burying wood has other benefits including minimizing CO2 source from deforestation, extending the lifetime of reforestation carbon sink, and reducing fire danger. There are possible environmental impacts such as nutrient lock-up which nevertheless appears manageable, but other concerns and factors will likely set a limit so that only part of the full potential can be realized. Based on data from North American logging industry, the cost for wood burial is estimated to be $14/tCO2($50/tC), lower than the typical cost for power plant CO2 capture with geological storage. The cost for carbon sequestration with wood burial is low because CO2 is removed from the atmosphere by the natural process of photosynthesis at little cost. The technique is low tech, distributed, easy to monitor, safe, and reversible, thus an attractive option for large-scale implementation in a world-wide carbon market. © 2008 Zeng; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Zeng, N.; Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science, , College Park, MD, United States; email: zeng@atmos.umd.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-40749159629

Uganda has a long history of ecological research. Some of the world’s oldest permanent sample plots occur in its forests, dating back to 1933 (Eggeling, 1947; Sheil, 1996). Management of forests for timber was always aimed at making logging sustainable, and in this respect Uganda was well ahead of its time. Initially, research in forests was designed to improve forest management, leading to changes in management practices that even influenced tropical forest management in other countries around the world (Dawkins and Philip, 1998). Similarly, research on savanna ecology and wildlife dates back to the 1950s in Uganda, although tracking of wildlife populations and culling of elephants (Loxodonta africana) began as early as the 1920s. The establishment of the Nuffield Unit of Tropical Animal Ecology (NUTAE) in Queen Elizabeth National Park in 1961, which later became the Uganda Institute of Ecology (UIE), was well ahead of most research stations in other savanna parks in Africa. Some of the first studies of large mammal ecology in African savannas and the impacts of grazing/browsing and fire were made in Uganda’s parks and led to management recommendations for culling in the late 1960s. Most of the research in Uganda’s Protected Areas has been associated with research stations. Uganda currently has three research stations in forested ecosystems: Makerere University Biological Field Station (Kibale National Park), Budongo Forest Project (Budongo Forest Reserve), and the Institute of Tropical Forest Conservation (Bwindi Impenetrable National Park). © Cambridge University Press 2008.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928084119

Unfortunately, tropical forests all over the world are threatened by human activities, including forest fragmentation and isolation, collection of non-timber forest products, poaching, fires, forest degradation, and deforestation (mainly through selective logging for timber). Such activities have the potential to disrupt the integrity and functioning of forest habitats, which in turn may lead to loss of species and some of the resources that tropical forests provide. This chapter reviews the impact of human activities in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Most of the conservation research that we report on here was short term (1 to 2 years). It was also based on a narrow range of ecological variables, such as the response of animal species to logging. As a result, the research findings are sometimes contradictory and difficult to interpret (Chapman, 2005). Kibale National Park has been the center of both short- and long-term research on various aspects of forest ecology (Struhsaker, 1997). Human activities that have led to modifications of the Kibale ecosystems have been going on for a long time but the best documented are those related to selective logging from 1954 to about 1978 and the loss of large herbivores (mainly elephant, Loxodonta Africana and buffalo, Syncerus caffer). Since the 1980s, other human-induced changes have taken place. © Cambridge University Press 2008.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928050172

More than ever, due to extensive fragmentation and other anthropogenic effects, forest fragments in unprotected areas must serve a dual function: providing a sustainable source of timber and nontimber products and providing essential intact forest habitat for biodiversity conservation within the landscape matrix. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) [1], sustainable forest management is a land use with similar goals to those that focus on biodiversity conservation principles. However, factors such as the initial structure of the forest and the scale and intensity of the logging operations [2], not to mention the short-and long-term effects of postharvesting [3], are important when forest management and biodiversity conservation goals converge. Therefore, monitoring of natural forest areas subject to forest management (selective logging) is necessary in order to assess forest recovery processes after disturbance. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905494958

Meanwhile, they have also been experiencing unprecedented severity of natural and human disturbance and suffering from ongoing deforestation. The destruction of tropical forests has imposed serious threat to the sustainable socio-economic development of the human society, such that how to effectively restore the degraded tropical forests has become one of the most urgent issues in the current biodiversity conservation. Land-use history interacts with natural forces to influence the severity of disturbance events and the rate and mode of recovery processes in tropical forests. The catastrophic natural disturbances, such as hurricane, fire, volcano, and flood, usually impact the tropical forests severely, but with very long return intervals. The main causes of tropical deforestation are several types of anthropogenic disturbances, such as logging, shifting cultivation, agricultural land exploitation, etc. The recovery process and rate of the anthropogenically-disturbed vegetation are obviously different from that of the naturally-disturbed vegetation. Compared with the community composition, the restoration rate of community structure is relative faster. Among the factors which relate to this pervasive change of tropical forests, those that influence the rate or even direction of ecological restoration include multiple disturbances and their interactions, inhabitation or competition of herbs and invasive species, the actual vegetation and soil conditions, residual vegetation components, landscape matrix around the degraded vegetation, and global climate change. In order to improve our understanding of vegetation restoration in tropical forests, the following were needed to be conduct further. The long-term data from established permanent plots can be used to generate hypotheses as objectives of short-term studies and allow analysis of vegetation responses to climate variation in the face of the ongoing global change. Apart from plants, other biota should also be studied during the secondary succession of vegetation. Because of expanding plantation in tropical regions, how to conserve biodiversity and restore ecological functioning in such artificially- constructed ecosystems will be a new topic in the future vegetation ecology studies. Our ability of predicting the direction of vegetation recovery on disturbed lands will be greatly improved when coupling with landscape is considered. The key point of ecological restoration is how to restore the ecological functioning of biodiversity. So studies based on functional groups could help us to better understand the ecological restoration process of the extremely high diversity tropical forest vegetations.","Disturbance regime; Secondary succession; Tropical forests; Vegetation restoration","Zang, R.-G.; Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Environment, , Beijing 100091, China; email: zangrung@caf.ac.cn",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149234772

Kenya's 416 km2 Arabuko-Sokoke Forest (ASF) is the largest remaining fragment of East African coastal dry forest and is considered a global biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al. 2000), but has been significantly altered by past commercial logging and ongoing extraction. Forest carbon storage for ASF was estimated using allometric equations for tree biomass, destructive techniques for litter and herbaceous vegetation biomass, and spectroscopy for soils. Satellite imagery was used to assess land cover changes from 1992 to 2004. Forest and thicket types (Cynometra webberi dominated, Brachystegia spiciformis dominated, and mixed species forest) had carbon densities ranging from 58 to 94 Mg C/ha. The ASF area supported a 2.8-3.0 Tg C carbon stock. Although total forested area in ASF did not change over the analyzed time period, ongoing disturbances, quantified by the basal area of cut tree stumps per sample plot, correlated with decreased carbon densities. Madunguni Forest, an adjoining forest patch, lost 86% of its forest cover and at least 76% of its terrestrial carbon stock in the time period. Improved management of wood harvesting in ASF and rehabilitation of Madunguni Forest could substantially increase terrestrial carbon sequestration in the region. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Africa; Arabuko-Sokoke Forest; Carbon storage; Dry coastal forest; Forest management; Kenya; Land cover change","Glenday, J.; Department of Environmental Management, PO Box 680, Durban 4000, South Africa; email: Julia_Glenday@alumni.brown.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949214856

Our objective is to explain the manner in which logging roads manifest spatially, thereby creating fragmented landscapes in a small portion of the so-called ""Terra do Meio,"" a region of 300,000 km 2 in the heart of the Amazon basin.

First, camera-trap surveys conducted in the Atlantic Forest of Misiones, Argentina, were used to test the hypothesis that selective logging and poaching affect the local abundance of this cat. Second, published density estimates (N = 21) were used to test the hypothesis that rainfall and latitude are correlated with the abundance of ocelots across their continental range. In Misiones, ocelot densities ranged from 4.96 ± 1.33 individuals per 100 km 2 in the intensely logged and hunted areas to 17.6 ± 2.25 individuals per 100 km2 in areas with low human impact. The frequency of records, number of individuals recorded per station, and density estimates were 2-3 times higher in areas with relatively low levels of logging and poaching. At a continental scale, ocelot densities decrease with latitude and increase with rainfall. Primary productivity seems to determine the abundance of wild cats across their range, but at a local scale their abundance may be affected by logging and poaching or by competition with other species. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.","Atlantic Forest; Density; Felids; Latitude; Logging; Neotropical cats; Ocelot; Poaching; Rainfall; Tropical forest","Di Bitetti, M.

Understanding what determines response and sensitivity can indicate how forest management might yield greater conservation benefits, and help us identify which lesser-known species may be especially vulnerable. We assessed the response of 41 Bornean mammals to selective timber harvest and tested eight hypotheses regarding the correlation between those responses and a range of species characteristics. Multivariate analyses show that phylogenetic species age is a key variable determining sensitivity. Older species are less able to cope with the effects of selective timber harvest. Most of these species are endemic to insular southeast Asia, and do not occur on the Asian mainland. These species are more specialized, and appear less able to cope with habitat change. In contrast, species tolerant to logging evolved more recently. This group tends to be omnivorous or herbivorous, to use all vegetation strata, and to be regionally widespread. This finding allows the sensitivity to habitat disturbance of lesser-known species to be predicted, and therefore has important conservation implications. These new insights also help in the design of large-scale forest landscapes that combine sustainable forest management and species conservation requirements. We recognize that these functions can be compatible, but that some species still need completely protected areas for their survival. © 2007 The Author(s).","Borneo; Conservation; Dipterocarp forest; Evolution; Forestry; Logging; Palaeoenvironment; Southeast Asia","Meijaard, E.; Nature Conservancy-East Kalimantan Program, Jl.

To achieve this goal, managers need tools to assess the sustainability of current management practices. Several international initiatives have undertaken the development of sets of criteria and indicators to help managers move towards sustainability. Among the indicators considered, the structure and composition of dung beetle communities have been identified as excellent indicators of ecological sustainability. However, as occurs with most indicators of the ecological sustainability of forest management, dung beetle surveys require intensive field work making their application over large areas expensive, time consuming, and logistically challenging. A need for prioritization is evident. This work presents a novel approach to the assessment of the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) ecological sustainability indicator I.2.1.2: ""The change in diversity of habitats as a result of human interventions is maintained within critical limits as defined by natural variation and/or regional conservation objectives"". Using variography of vegetation index data derived from remotely sensed imagery, we show (1) how the differences in forest structural heterogeneity observed between forest management units and natural areas can be used to identify priority areas for field survey of ecological sustainability indicators (hereafter ""priority-for-survey"") and (2) how these priorities correspond to dung beetle community structure and composition. Links between temporal change in forest structural heterogeneity, logging intensity, and dung beetle community structure and composition were established by means of correlation analysis and matrix regression modeling. We found that areas ranked as low priority-for-survey based on image analysis showed no significant difference in dung beetle species richness or diversity from natural reference areas. Further, we found significantly higher dung beetle species richness and diversity estimates in areas ranked as moderate or moderate-low priority-for-survey over the low and reference areas. Finally, the dung beetle community composition in the high priority-for-survey category was significantly less rich and less diverse than any other category. We identified a logging intensity threshold of four trees per hectare as a transition to significant differences in forest structural heterogeneity and the richness and diversity of associated dung beetle communities. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

As dictated by a forest management plan based on forest zoning, about 51,000 ha of the entire area is set aside for log production and 4,000 ha for conservation in Deramakot Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysia. This Forest Management Plan has served as the blueprint for operational work and biodiversity conservation in Deramakot to the present. A strict protection area is set aside for biodiversity conservation within the reserve. A reduced-impact logging system is being employed for harvesting with minimal impacts on the physical environment. Deramakot Forest Reserve was certified as well managed by an international certification body, the Forest Stewardship Council, in 1997 and is the first natural forest reserve in Southeast Asia managed in accordance with sustainable forestry principles. In addition to providing a green premium, certification provides easier market access, evidence of legality, multistakeholder participation, conservation of biodiversity and best forest management practices, particularly reduced- impact logging techniques.

These guidelines appear to be based largely on reserve design theory from the conservation biology literature including recommendations for large, contiguous blocks of reserves interconnected with other protected areas through corridor networks. Such recommendations, however, are largely applicable to protected areas that are embedded within fragmented landscapes or where there is signifi cant threat of deforestation. In contrast, protected areas within managed forests in Bolivia are surrounded by areas of largely intact forest subjected to low-intensity reduced impact logging and where logging occurs with a felling cycle not less than 20 years. Following an analysis of the current Bolivian law, conservation goals, and pertinent literature, we argue that issues of size and connectivity are perhaps less important within landscapes dominated by areas under forest management for timber production compared to protected areas imbedded within fragmented landscapes. It may, therefore, be more effective to disperse ecological reserves throughout management units to protect critical habitat and sites prone to damage from logging.","Biodiversity; Conservation; Forest management; Logging; Protected area","Fredericksen, T.S.; Ferrum College, 212 Garber Hall, Ferrum, VA 24088, United States; email: tfredericksen@ferrum.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67549096686

On the oceanic islands of Wallacea, small-scale agriculture, rather than commercial logging, is the main cause of forest loss and conversion, but few studies have directly examined their responses to land use. In 2001, I studied the birds of primary forest and anthropogenic gardens on the well-forested, and remote, Damar Island (198 km2) in the Banda Sea. Furthermore, I examined broad changes to the islands bird fauna by comparing baseline bird lists obtained in the 19th century with 2001 data. The conversion of primary forest to garden resulted in substantial changes in avifaunal composition, and to the abundance of individual bird species, particularly to frugivorous and globally restricted-range species. Of 15 common birds, four were significantly more abundant in primary forest (blue-tailed imperial pigeon Ducula concinna, northern fantail Rhipidura rufiventris, golden whistler Pachycephala pectoralis and red-chested flowerpecker Dicaeum maugei) and one (scaly-breasted honeyeater Lichmera squamata) was more abundant in garden habitat. Incidental observations provided further evidence that many forest specialists (including the island endemic Damar flycatcher Ficedula henrici) rarely, if ever, used garden habitats notwithstanding its relative proximity. The number of resident birds recorded in 2001 (39) was similar to the 1890s (38), but six forest-dependent passerines were extirpated between samples. These losses are associated with the conversion of 25% of the primary forest to modified habitat since the 1890s, but given the sparse species and environmental change data available it is impossible to definitively pinpoint this as the only cause underlying the species losses. This study demonstrates that remote and relatively well-forested islands are not immune to the threatening processes impacting bird populations elsewhere in South-East Asia. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The Brazilian Federal Government has launched a fiscal incentive program for plantation establishment in 1966. The focus of this program was to encourage reforestation in southern Brazil, and to provide a reliable source of raw material for forest industry development.

The results of long-term (30 years) studies of the breeding birds in the Białowieża National Park are summarized. They reveal that the local avifauna shows some features (high species richness, low population densities, high nest predation and low production of young) regarded as typical for undisturbed tropical forests. It is proposed that high productivity, high population densities and sedentary habits found in many British populations are to a large extent a recent phenomenon, due to forest fragmentation, reduction of predator diversity and changes in forest structure.

This study evaluates the regional context of the valley by a comparison of data from a series of one hectare plots giving data on the diversity and structure of trees ≥10 dbh, and then examines in more detail data from a 1 ha plot located in a newly declared conservation area (Pampa Hermosa Reserved Zone) embodying one of the most intact forest remains. An explicit goal was also to test the efficacy of sampling using taxonomic surrogacy, which could provide an effective means of making more efficient such work among diverse tropical forests. The Cedros de Pampa Hermosa plot contained 444 individuals belonging to 135 species, 66 genera and 35 families. The families Lauraceae, Meliaceae, Moraceae and Urticaceae provided over half of the individuals counted. The high representation of Urticaceae species suggests a disturbance regime driven by the large sizes of the Meliaceae species and their dynamics on steep slopes. Indicator species analyses supported other evidence that this site at 1,600 m is located in a broad ecotonal area transitioning to premontane and lowland rain forests. Ordinations (nMDS) based on Bray-Curtis similarities and total abundance, basal areas and presence-absence data of the 598 species (3,469 individuals) found on all seven one hectare plots sampled in the valley showed a clear separation into three tree assemblage types, namely the lower montane site, and two others on the eastern and western sides of the valley. Ordination patterns were quite similar at species and family level, but did not show any site groupings at the generic level, suggesting important turnover of species and families along environmental gradients. A number of species could not be allocated to known taxonomic groups, and were evaluated as morphotaxa. The inclusion or exclusion of such taxa did not dramatically alter the main ordination patterns within taxonomic levels of botanical family or of species, which implies that rapid inventory methods and incomplete identifications can still provide data useful for conservation planning in this and similar forests. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Montane forest; Morphospecies; Surrogacy; Tree diversity; Tropical forest","La Torre-Cuadros, M.D.L.Á.Av. 8 de Octubre 184, Lima 18, Lima, Peru; email: angeleslatorre@lamolina.edu.pe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548426531

The forests of the Yucatan Peninsula form part of the largest remaining tract of Mesoamerican forests, where the predominant land use is still slash-and-burn agriculture. Previous estimates of aboveground live phytomass of late-successional forests in this region vary almost twofold, but are derived from relatively few forest plots. We estimate aboveground forest biomass using data from 243 inventoried forest plots (totalling 58.5 ha), ranging across a disturbance gradient from nearly intact to severely degraded forests. We assess the effects of environmental and disturbance variables on forest basal area, stand-level wood specific gravity and aboveground biomass. Major differences in basal area and aboveground biomass were explained by levels of human disturbance (clear-cutting, logging, and fire disturbance), whereas edaphic factors played only a minor role. Total mean phytomass density estimates ranged from 28.8 ± 3.8 mg ha-1 in plots aged 10-15 years to 191.9 ± 9.5 mg ha-1 in undisturbed old-growth forest plots (&gt;50 years). Severe logging and fire disturbance reduced AGB in late-successional plots (30-50 years) by 36% and 37%, respectively. Stand-level wood specific gravity increased with succession, due to an increase in the proportion of total basal area contributed by high wood density genera. Logging intensity had a small additional effect on stand-level wood specific gravity. Incorporating stand-level wood specific gravity into the algorithm explained only an additional 4% of the variation in estimates of aboveground biomass, which was largely determined by basal area. However, ignoring plot-level variation in wood specific gravity resulted in overestimates of 19% in plots aged 10-15 years. Our aboveground biomass estimates were highly comparable with previous studies using the same allometric equations, and fell within the highest range of estimates reported for tropical dry forests. Forest of this region still retains a significant carbon stock, but rates of biomass recovery (2.8 ± 0.2S.E. mg ha-1 year-1) were low compared to other neotropical forests. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Reduced impact logging is a program designed to achieve more cost-effective and sustainable logging practices through good stand inventories, sound silvicultural practices, less waste and damage in the operations, and replanting where necessary. The program also involves design and construction of improved logging roads. Many roads being constructed and used today are poorly built, poorly drained, and poorly maintained. Resulting impacts include unnecessarily high road costs, inefficient logging operations, and significant negative environmental impacts. Little consideration is given to longterm or full life-cycle costs of the roads. These are not new problems. The objectives of this paper are to identify ongoing common problems and recommend practical solutions, reiterate the need for good basic engineering practices, and highlight some of the negative impacts of poor engineering practices. Key problems that appear to cause unnecessarily high road costs and inefficient logging operations include inadequate road surface drainage, excessively wide roads and roads built under inconsistent design standards, inadequate use of available road surfacing materials, inadequate road maintenance, and poor road location and the subsequent need for road reconstruction. A variety of other road drainage, materials, and erosion control issues also need improving. Social and environmental issues related to roads and their access include colonization and development along the road corridor, illegal logging and subsequent deforestation, bush meat hunting and wildlife depletion, spread of diseases, and other land use changes.

Impacts associated with such operations have been especially troubling in many tropical countries, where mature trees often have large crowns capable of destroying other trees when they fall; soils remain wet for much of the year and are highly susceptible to significant compaction and erosion; loggers typically have little education, are poorly trained, and often must work and live in arduous, unhealthy conditions; and remote locations make oversight by government agencies difficult. Beginning in the early 1990s, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) launched a concerted effort to develop and promote codes of forest harvesting practice that would provide guidelines for planning and controlling logging operations in tropical forests in order to reduce environmental impacts. This effort included research to define and validate reduced-impact logging practices and technologies; publication and distribution of a ""model"" code of forest harvesting practices; development and promotion of regional codes of practice; and provision of technical assistance to individual countries to develop and implement national codes of practice. Although FAO provided the initial stimulus for the effort and has remained a central player, much of the work has been done by a wide variety of research institutes and universities; nongovernmental organizations; industry associations; government technical-assistance programs; and international agencies such as the International Tropical Timber Organization, the International Labor Organization, and the World Bank.

These differences substantially affect predictions of future timber yield. After incorporating realistic growth variation, we calculated timber yields that were 36-50% higher than those calculated using average growth rates. Even so, the regrowth of timber volume in a 20-year interval between logging events is low (18-24%) due to the old age of trees that are logged at first harvest.

We studied pollination patterns of the African mahogany, Entandrophragma cylindricum (Sapelli). We investigated two plots in Cameroon corresponding to three tree densities: unlogged forest (Ndama 2002), a mildly logged forest 1 year after logging (Ndama 2003) and a severely logged forest 30 years after logging (Dimako). We used four microsatellite markers to perform paternity analysis. Selfing remained below 2% in all treatments. Pollen flow was mainly long distance but with some proximity effects. Average observed within-plot pollination distances were 338, 266 and 385 m, and pollination by trees outside the plots was 70% (Ndama 2002), 74% (Ndama 2003) and 66% (Dimako). Despite sampling a limited number of seeds from a limited number of mother trees, we obtained seeds sired by 35.6-38.3% of the potential within-plot pollen donors. While trees 20 cm in diameter contributed to pollination, results in Dimako suggest that individual larger trees contribute more to pollination than small ones. This effect was not detected in the other treatments. The results suggest extensive pollen flow in Sapelli. Hence, in Sapelli, the main limiting factor for regeneration after logging may be a reduction in the number of trees capable of producing seeds rather genetic effects due to limits to pollen dispersal. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.","Mating system; Microsatellites; Paternity analysis; Pollen dispersal; Selective logging; Tropical forest","Chevallier, M.-H.; CEFE, 1919 route de Mende, F-34293 Montpellier Cedex 5, France; email: marie-helene.chevallier@cefe.cnrs.fr",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547223382

South-east Asia has the highest relative rate of habitat loss and degradation in the humid tropics. The responses of less 'charismatic' groups, including butterflies, to habitat disturbance remain relatively poorly understood. Many South-east Asian butterflies are endemic to the region and face global extinction if current levels of deforestation were to continue. 2. Here, I highlight South-east Asia as a region urgently in need of butterfly conservation research and review empirical studies of the responses of South-east Asian butterflies to land use change. Additionally, I discuss some methodological pitfalls for such studies. Furthermore, I argue for the importance of identifying the ecological correlates of sensitivity of butterfly species to forest modification and the potential biological mechanisms underlying their responses to land use change. 3. There has been no consensus among previous studies on the effects of land use change on butterfly communities in South-east Asia. Of the 20 studies I reviewed, seven reported higher species richness/diversity in undisturbed (or the least disturbed) forest than in disturbed habitats, nine reported the opposite trend, three reported no difference and one reported a strong influence of seasonality on the impacts of logging. 4. Some of these studies may contain inherent methodological biases resulting from the failure to control for sampling effects, the lack of consideration for the spatial scale of analysis and incomplete sampling of the vertical strata in tropical rainforests. 5. Synthesis and applications. Empirical studies of the effects of land use change on tropical forest insects are sorely lacking from South-east Asia. Butterflies are an ideal taxonomic group for such investigations. Future studies should be designed carefully to avoid the methodological pitfalls highlighted here. Determining the ecological correlates of sensitivity of butterflies to forest modification is important for the pre-emptive identification of species of conservation concern and for generating testable hypotheses on the differential responses of species to forest modification. Experimental studies are needed to determine the mechanisms underlying the responses of species to land use change in order to develop effective strategies for the conservation of butterflies in human disturbed landscapes. © 2007 The Author.","Biodiversity; Biogeography; Extinction proneness; Lepidoptera; Life history; Physiology; Tropical ecology","Koh, L.P.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, , Princeton, NJ 08544, United States; email: lkoh@princeton.edu",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347381299

In addition, bats may represent keystone taxa in the Neotropics, as they are primary agents of pollination and seed dispersal for many pioneer plants. We assessed the impact of low harvest (18 m3/ha), reduced impact logging (RIL) on population and community characteristics of phyllostomid bats in Amazonian terra firme forest of Brazil at 20-42 months post-harvest. Based on 103,680 net-meter-hours of netting in Tapajós National Forest, 2341 phyllostomids were captured, representing 42 species, 25 genera, and 4 broad feeding guilds. Population-level responses of common phyllostomids to RIL were minor, with 10 of 15 species evincing no change in mean abundance. Of those taxa responding to RIL (mean difference in number of individuals per site), three increased (Artibeus concolor [0.46 individuals], Artibeus lituratus [3.88], and Glossophaga soricina [0.71]) and two decreased (Carollia brevicauda [0.96] and Carollia perspicillata [14.04]) in abundance. Compositional (species distributions) and structural (rank distributions) aspects of bat assemblages differed between cut and control forests. More specifically, bat assemblages in cut forest had increased diversity and decreased dominance compared to control forest. Nonetheless, the proportional abundance of the five most common species, as a group, was similar in cut (86%) and control forest (88%), and frugivores dominated assemblages in both management types. Mean abundance of frugivores decreased (10.59 individuals per site) in response to RIL; however, this response was driven by decreases in C. perspicillata, the most abundant species in terra firme forest. Although RIL had only minor effects on biodiversity in the short-term, extrapolation to a long-term prospectus should be exercised with caution when applied to conservation or policy issues. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

There is an urgent demand for setting up an appropriate environmental assessment to keep healthy ecosystem functions and biodiversity along with sustainable forest use based on ecology. In this study, we tried to assess logging-disturbance effects on the abundances of several flying insect groups (higher-taxon approach) in lowland tropical rain forest (Deramakot Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysia), while considering seasonal changes and vertical forest stratification. The season was the most important factor affecting the abundances of all the insect groups. Effects of logging disturbance were prominent in the understorey but obscure in the canopy. Changes in physical conditions caused by logging-possibly an increased evaporation due to solar radiation-may have decreased the abundance of desiccation-sensitive insects, especially in the understorey. There are also two probable reasons for the difference between events in the understorey and those in the canopy: (1) noise effects of various physical, environmental factors may have obscured insect responses to logging disturbance in the canopy; (2) higher spatio-temporal variation in quality and quantity of living food resources-such as leaves, flowers and fruits-provided in the canopy may have affected the abundance of their consumer insects independently of logging disturbance. Thus, this study suggests that the abundance of some insect groups at higher-taxon level, especially in the understorey, can be used as bioindicators for assessing effects of logging disturbance on the forest ecosystem. © 2006 The Ecological Society of Japan.","Bioindicator; Flying insects; Higher-taxon approach; Selective logging; Tropical forests","Akutsu, K.; Institute of Low Temperature Science, Kita 19 Nishi 8, Kitaku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0819, Japan; email: akosuke@pop.lowtem.hokudai.ac.jp",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347214463

This study compares road track and roadside regeneration with regeneration in unlogged and selectively logged humid tropical forest in north-eastern Bolivia.

This was the case for the small-seeded species Ficus boliviana C.C. Berg and Terminalia oblonga (Ruiz & Pav.) Steud. Some species, e.g. Hura crepitans L., displayed patchy regeneration coinciding with the presence of adult trees. Our results suggest that current management practices could be improved by intensifying logging in some areas to improve regeneration of light demanding species. Sufficient seed input in logged areas should be ensured by interspersing large patches of unlogged forest with logged areas.

We conducted a census of adult tree densities for these species on 94 selectively logged sites located in a tropical rain forest on the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. We compared the abundance of juveniles and seedlings for both tree species on 11 logged and unlogged sites. In addition, we analyzed the growth and mortality rates of adult trees of P. purpurea (>10 cm dbh) in a 4 ha permanent plot that was selectively logged once in 1992. Both species presented a heterogeneous density distribution over the Osa Peninsula (166,668 ha) and the highest density of both species is located in the region of the highest logging activity. For C. costaricense, seedling (height < 50 cm) and juvenile (height > 50 cm, dbh < 2 cm) abundance was greater in unlogged areas, while trees 2-10 cm dbh were more abundant in logged areas. For P. purpurea, seedlings were more abundant in unlogged areas, but small and large juvenile abundance did not differ between selectively logged treatments. The density of P. purpurea adult trees remained constant 15 years after selective logging but the density of trees 10-30 cm dbh decreased in the same period. We predict that recurrent 15 year cutting cycles of 50% of timber trees with restricted distribution, as it is practiced by conventional logging in Costa Rica, may lead a significant reduction of the main reproductive individuals, decreasing the regeneration of the populations subjected to exploitation and fragmentation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Our objective was to identify a method of controlling M. faya, which would allow native plants to establish while minimizing establishment by invasive plants. Treatments (logging all trees, trees left standing but girdled, and incremental girdling over 20 months) were selected to kill M. faya stands at different rates, thereby creating different conditions for species establishment. Leaf litter was either removed or left in place; seeds and seedlings of three native pioneer species, three native forest species, and three alien invasive species were then added to determine their ability to establish. Native pioneer species established best in the log and girdle treatments, whereas seedling emergence of native forest species was higher in the girdle and incremental girdle treatments. Seedlings of invasive species emerged faster than the natives, but each of them responded differently to the stand treatments. Leaf litter reduced seedling emergence for all species, with small-seeded species (<1 mg/seed) affected most under low light conditions. No single method eliminated all invaders, but girdling of M. faya provided suitable conditions for most native species. If combined with selective removal of the most disruptive alien species and native seed additions, girdling could be an effective general strategy for restoring native forests that have been overwhelmed by woody invaders. © 2007 Society for Ecological Restoration International.","Disturbance; Girdling; Hawai'i; Invader; Leaf; Litter; Restoration; Tropical forest","Loh, R.K.; National Park Service, PO Box 52, HVNP, HI 96718, United States; email: rhonda_loh@nps.gov",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249655047

Implementation of policies to reduce emissions from deforestation require effective deforestation monitoring systems that are reproducible, provide consistent results, meet standards for mapping accuracy, and can be implemented at the national level. Remotely sensed data supported by ground observations are key to effective monitoring. Capacity in developing countries for deforestation monitoring is well-advanced in a few countries and is a feasible goal in most others. Data sources exist to determine base periods in the 1990s as historical reference points. Forest degradation (e.g. from high impact logging and fragmentation) also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions but it is more technically challenging to measure than deforestation. Data on carbon stocks, which are needed to estimate emissions, cannot currently be observed directly over large areas with remote sensing. Guidelines for carbon accounting from deforestation exist and are available in approved Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports and can be applied at national scales in the absence of forest inventory or other data. Key constraints for implementing programs to monitor greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation are international commitment of resources to increase capacity, coordination of observations to ensure pan-tropical coverage, access to free or low-cost data, and standard and consensual protocols for data interpretation and analysis. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

To objectively evaluate the conservation status of these species, standardized methods are urgently required. The sun bear Helarctos malayanus is a case in point: it is cryptic, difficult to detect and consequently classified on the IUCN Red List as Data Deficient, and the highest priority for bear conservation research. In this study, we apply a detection/non-detection sampling technique using camera trap data with environmental covariates to estimate sun bear occupancy from three tropical forest study areas with different levels of degradation and protection status in Sumatra. Sun bear detections, and encounter rates, were highest in one of the primary forest study areas, but sun bear occupancy was highest in the degraded forest study area. Whilst, sun bears were recorded at a greater proportion of camera placements in degraded forest, these records were often on only one occasion at each placement, which greatly increased the final occupancy estimate. Primary forests with their large fruiting trees undoubtedly represent good sun bear habitat, but our results indicate that degraded forest can also represent important habitat. These forests should therefore not be considered as having limited conservation value and assigned to other uses, such as oil palm production, as has previously happened in Sumatra. Estimating occupancy between years will yield information on the population trends of sun bears and other tropical mammals, which can be used to provide more reliable conservation assessments. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, both biological and policy constraints threaten to limit the viability of the industry over the long term. Biological constraints, such as slow tree growth rates, can be overcome somewhat by management practices. In order to improve the likelihood of success for sustainable management, it is important to accept that forests change over time and that managed forests may be different than those of the present. Furthermore, education campaigns must convince decision makers and the public of the value of forest resources. We recommend that the forest sector be governed by simple, understandable regulations, based on sound science and consistent enforcement, and that governments work with, instead of against, industry.

We compared bat richness, abundance and diversity, and found that none of these variables was different among stages or rainy seasons. However, of the 10 most common bat species, two were significantly more abundant in stands at the early stages of secondary succession, while the opposite was true for three other species. Canopy cover mainly explains these patterns. Rainy season had no effect on the abundance of the common species. The results of this study indicate that although some frugivorous species were very abundant in the younger stands, the majority of the rare species were captured in older stands. The absence of rare and habitat-specialized species from young successional stages close to primary forest suggests that, for effective bat conservation in landscapes modified by human activity, areas with original vegetation should be maintained to ensure the survivorship of sensitive-to-deforestation species. © 2007 The Zoological Society of London.","Bats; Canopy cover; Secondary succession; Selective logging; Slash-and-burn","Sosa, V.J.; Instituto de Ecología, , Xalapa, Veracruz 91000, Mexico; email: vinicio.sosa@inecol.edu.mx",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247863667

We also show that capturing economies of scale in logging by increasing average annual logging volumes by 50% and reducing the number of firms to about 1400 could lead to an industry wide cost savings of approximately US$90 million per year. Similar economies of scale are also present in log transport but not in processing. Further, if improved logging techniques allow harvest for an additional 1 month per year, for example through better planning, the industry could reduce logging costs by almost US$30 million. This points towards generating forest policies and economic conditions that encourage firm size growth, as opposed to those policies encouraging massive entry of small, unregulated and inefficient firms, and the adoption of management practices that allow for additional time in the forest. © 2006.","Amazon; Cost functions; Logging industry; Tropical forests","Amacher, G.S.; Department of Forestry, , Blacksburg, VA, United States; email: gamacher@vt.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247492017

A climate of generalized lawlessness and impunity prevails, and matters related to environment and to land tenure are especially unregulated. Deforestation and illegal logging have accelerated in anticipation of highway paving. Paving would further speed forest loss in the area, as well as stimulate migration of land thieves (grileiros) to other frontiers.

Full inventories of FCTs of 50 commercial species complexes were conducted before and after logging in 50 m-radius zones of impact around each designated harvest tree in three 10 ha (200 m × 500 m) logging blocks. We also mapped all forested areas potentially influenced by logging, including skid trails, log landings and felling gaps, throughout the 30 ha logged. More than 28% of the forest area was disturbed by logging, with 12.1% in skid trails and 16.8% in gap clearings, indicating that the forest gap mosaic can be significantly altered even when reduced-impact logging guidelines are followed. Overall, 15% of FCTs inventoried were damaged. Damage rates were not significantly reduced by marking treatment, location in bamboo-dominated forest, or liana load on FCT damage. Harvest intensity did not influence the probability of FCT damage. For future studies, it would be prudent to address impacts of timber extraction on other livelihood activities, such as non-timber forest product collection, particularly in such regions as the Brazilian Amazon, where many communities are attempting to integrate a suite of income-generating activities. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The main processes included are growth, mortality, competition, and regeneration of trees. The FORREG model simulates wood growth of tropical forests at landscape scale based on differential equations. Regeneration capabilities of logged forests are analysed and compared for different logging strategies. While conventional management strategies with a short logging cycle (here 20 years) produce low yields and cause severe changes in tree species composition, a reduced impact logging strategy with a longer cycle (here 60 years) leads to relatively high yields and causes moderate changes in species composition. Thus, longer logging cycles are preferable from an ecological point of view. However, also economic aspects influence logging decisions, thus a closer analysis of additional economic aspects of forest management is inevitable.

To help derive such an understanding for Borneo, we monitored aboveground fine litterfall, woody biomass increment and ANPP (their sum) in mature forest over 29 months across a soil nutrient gradient in southwestern Kalimantan. In 30 (0.07 ha) plots stratified throughout the watershed (∼340 ha, 8-190 m a.s.l.), we measured productivity and tested its relationship with 27 soil parameters. ANPP across the study area was among the highest reported for mature lowland tropical forests. Aboveground fine litterfall ranged from 5.1 to 11.0 Mg ha-1 year-1 and averaged 7.7 ± 0.4 (mean ± 95 C.I.). Woody biomass increment ranged from 5.8 to 23.6 Mg ha-1 year-1 and averaged 12.0 ± 2.0. Growth of large trees (≥60 cm dbh) contributed 38-82% of plot-wide biomass increment and explained 92% of variation among plots. ANPP, the sum of these parameters, ranged from 11.1 to 32.3 Mg ha-1 year-1 and averaged 19.7 ± 2.2. ANPP was weakly related to fine litterfall (r2= 0.176), but strongly related to growth of large trees at least 60 cm dbh (r2= 0.848). Adjusted ANPP after accounting for apparent ""mature forest bias"" in our sampling method was 17.5 ± 1.2 Mg ha-1 year-1.Relating productivity measures to soil parameters showed that spatial patterning in productivity was significantly related to soil nutrients, especially phosphorus (P). Fine litterfall increased strongly with extractable P (r2=0.646), but reached an asymptote at moderate P levels, whereas biomass increment (r 2=0.473) and ANPP (r2=0.603) increased linearly across the gradient. Biomass increment of large trees was more frequently and strongly related to nutrients than small trees, suggesting size dependency of tree growth on nutrients. Multiple linear regression confirmed the leading importance of soil P, and identified Ca as a potential co-limiting factor. Our findings strongly suggest that (1) soil nutrients, especially P, limit aboveground productivity in lowland Bornean forests, and (2) these forests play an important, but changing role in carbon cycles, as canopy tree logging alters these terrestrial carbon sinks. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","ANPP; Biomass increment; Carbon; Dipterocarpaceae; Fine litterfall; Kalimantan; Land use change; Nutrient limitation; Phosphorus; Sequestration; Sinks","Paoli, G.D.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, 830 N.

Direct measurements of aboveground live biomass (AGLB) are limited to small areas of forest inventory plots and site-specific allometric equations that cannot be readily generalized for the entire basin. Furthermore, there is no spaceborne remote sensing instrument that can measure tropical forest biomass directly. To determine the spatial distribution of forest biomass of the Amazon basin, we report a method based on remote sensing metrics representing various forest structural parameters and environmental variables, and more than 500 plot measurements of forest biomass distributed over the basin. A decision tree approach was used to develop the spatial distribution of AGLB for seven distinct biomass classes of lowland old-growth forests with more than 80% accuracy. AGLB for other vegetation types, such as the woody and herbaceous savanna and secondary forests, was directly estimated with a regression based on satellite data. Results show that AGLB is highest in Central Amazonia and in regions to the east and north, including the Guyanas. Biomass is generally above 300Mgha-1 here except in areas of intense logging or open floodplains. In Western Amazonia, from the lowlands of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia to the Andean mountains, biomass ranges from 150 to 300Mgha-1. Most transitional and seasonal forests at the southern and northwestern edges of the basin have biomass ranging from 100 to 200Mgha-1. The AGLB distribution has a significant correlation with the length of the dry season. We estimate that the total carbon in forest biomass of the Amazon basin, including the dead and belowground biomass, is 86PgC with ± 20% uncertainty. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Amazon; Biomass; Cimate; Rainforest; Remote sensing","Saatchi, S.S.; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, , Pasadena, CA, United States; email: saatchi@congo.jpl.nasa.gov",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247324422

There have been many attempts to determine the ecological traits associated with bird species' vulnerability to disturbance, but no attempt has been made to synthesize these studies to show consensus. We analyzed data from 57 published studies (covering 1214 bird species) that investigated the response of tropical bird assemblages to moderate forest disturbance (e.g., selective logging). Our results show that the mean abundance of species from six commonly reported feeding guilds responded differently to disturbance and that species' ecological traits (body size, local population size, and geographic range size) and evolutionary relationships may influence responses in some guilds. Granivore abundance increased significantly and insectivore and frugivore abundance decreased significantly following disturbance. These general conclusions were robust to the effects of ecological traits and phylogeny. Responses of carnivores, nectarivores, and omnivores were less clear, but analyses that accounted for phylogeny indicated that these guilds declined following disturbance. In contrast to the other guilds, the reported responses of carnivores and nectarivores differed among regions (Asia vs. Neotropics) and were influenced by the sampling protocols used in different studies (e.g., time since disturbance), which may explain the difficulty in detecting general responses to disturbance in these guilds. Overall, general patterns governed the responses of species to habitat disturbance, and the differential responses of guilds suggested that disturbance affects trophic organization and thus ecosystem functioning. © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.","Habitat modification; Meta-analysis; Phylogeny; Tropical diversity","Gray, M.A.; Department of Biology, , York YO10 5YW, United Kingdom; email: mg162@york.ac.uk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846941147

It is less clear whether these gains remain consistent in smallholder forest systems that increasingly play an important role in global conservation and that target a broader suite of outputs in their management schemes. We evaluate potential ecological consequences of five RIL components (pre-harvest inventories, harvest intensity, cutting cycles, skid trail planning, and liana cutting) when applied to small-scale operations in the Brazilian Amazon and provide suggestions for modifications to RIL guidelines for smallholder systems. Rapid assessment inventories of the entire landholding should be a part of crop tree selection to minimize inbreeding and recruitment failure. Additionally, while community-based taxonomists accurately identify species to common names, botanical samples must be verified with herbarium specimens to avoid market and ecological problems when multiple species share a single common name. We advocate that smallholder managers move beyond an emphasis on RIL guidelines, while still incorporating its basic tenets into practical application. Based on our analysis, this would include evaluating benefits of particular RIL components and assessing potential advantages that smallholders have over industrial operations. We suggest incorporating anthropogenically-generated forest patches of varying sizes and successional stages into a more formalized management system, incorporating and expanding on traditional ecological knowledge acquired over generations, and integrating enrichment plantings and tending of regeneration. © 2006.","Community forest management; Forest inventories; Liana cutting; Sustained yield; Timber management; Tropical forest conservation","Rockwell, C.; School of Forest Resources and Conservation, , Gainesville, FL 32611, United States; email: crockwel@ufl.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845980266

We also measured standing dead trees at the Tapajos National Forest, Para, Brazil (3.08°S, 54.94°W) complementing our earlier study there on fallen necromass. We compared forest that was selectively logged using reduced-impact logging methods and undisturbed forest. We estimated necromass density accounting for void volume for necromass greater than 10 cm diameter at Juruena for five decay classes that ranged from freshly fallen (class 1) to highly decayed material (class 5). Average necromass density adjusted for void space (±S.E.) was 0.71 (0.02), 0.69 (0.04), 0.60 (0.04), 0.59 (0.06), and 0.33 (0.05) Mg m-3 for classes 1 through 5, respectively.

We measured the above-canopy fluxes of momentum, sensible heat (H), CO2, and water vapor (Et), and the vertical profiles of CO2 and water vapor, from two 67-m meteorological towers in a selectively logged Brazilian rainforest. The logging removed ∼3.5 trees ha-1, and increased the incidence of gaps by a factor of 3 over nearby undisturbed forest. One tower was located in an intact patch of forest within the selectively logged area; the other was 400 m upwind in a large gap created by the logging. During daytime the subcanopy air in the intact patch of forest had more CO2, more water vapor, and was cooler than the air at comparable altitudes in the gap. Meanwhile, the daytime CO2 flux was less negative (reduced CO2 uptake) above the gap than above the intact forest, the daytime Et was greater above the gap than the intact forest, and the daytime H was lower above the gap than the intact forest. These patterns cannot be explained fully by the local loss of canopy gas exchange in the gap, but are consistent with the horizontal transport into the gap, and subsequent vertical transport out of the gap, of high-CO2, humid, cool air from the forest understory. The understory was drier and warmer during daytime after the logging, which would be expected to increase flammability.

An increasing portion of this new agricultural land is abandoned within a few years and left for succession by woody plants. In many regions, already a considerable fraction of the forested area is covered by secondary forests formed by rapidly growing, short-lived pioneer tree species. In the Lore Lindu National Park on Sulawesi (Indonesia), like in other tropical countries, many of the remaining patches of protected primary forest are also offended at their margins by neighbouring villagers, who practise selective logging or local planting of crops inside the forest. Thus, disturbed old-growth forest and regrowing secondary forest after clearcut represent woody vegetation types, which are of rapidly growing importance throughout the tropics. Considerable research has focused on the effects of disturbance — natural as well as human-induced — on above-ground vegetation in primary forests, and on leaf and canopy characteristics of secondary as compared to primary forest trees. Only a few studies, however, have addressed the effects of disturbance and forest conversion on the below-ground compartment in wet tropical forests. This review surveys the literature on fine root biomass (roots &lt; 2 mm) and its distribution and activity in disturbed old-growth and secondary tropical moist forests and compares the results with non-disturbed old-growth forests. Particular attention is being paid to the relationship between disturbance intensity, above-ground forest structure and fine root system size and structure. Secondly, we focus on the age-dependence of fine root biomass in regrowing secondary forests and the time required for fine root biomass recovery after clearcut. The results are interpreted with respect to carbon storage in the root system of tropical moist forests and its response to disturbance and conversion. © 2007, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","agroforest system; anthropogenic disturbance; crop species; disturbance intensity; disturbance type; fine root mass; fire; forest conversion; forest regeneration; hurricane; logging; natural disturbance; old-growth forests; root distribution; secondary forests; tree fall",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108446839

Assessing the effects of logging on different aspects of biodiversity and general ecosystem properties is hence of prime importance if the few remaining areas of intact tropical forest are to be protected effectively and efficiently. As we will point out in this chapter, tropical amphibian communities are an appropriate model system for studies on the impacts of human-induced environmental changes on the dynamics of complex biological systems. Here, we elaborate on patterns of diversity changes in tropical forest amphibian communities facing habitat alterations associated with selective logging in two globally important eco-regions (Côte d’Ivoire, Upper Guinea, West Africa and Guyana, the Guiana Shield, northern South America), and discuss findings from other previously conducted studies with similar focus. A key statement that we stress on in this chapter is the fact that common measures of diversity, such as species richness and α-diversity only inadequately reflect processes of diversity change following anthropogenic disturbance. They also fail to describe actual impacts on the dynamics of complex biological systems. We argue that commonly used measures produce an incoherent and insufficient picture of diversity patterns and the underlying processes that shape these patterns. Thus, an understanding of higher levels of diversity, such as β-diversity and functional diversity (and hence compositional patterns) appears to be the key to effectively mitigating the impacts of human-induced disturbance on amphibian communities. We show that the predictability of amphibian community composition depends on the respective level of anthropogenic disturbance imposed on a particular habitat. Hence, human activities that lead to changes in the structure of a forest, such as logging, not only alter simple system descriptors, such as the number of species in a given community, but rather alter the dynamics of the entire system. In this context, functional diversity is shown to be an important aspect underlying the actual mechanism that leads to the observed change of predictability patterns. Functional differences between species, rather than number of species per se appear to be the decisive factor in sustaining desirable ecosystem states and thus in maintaining important ecosystem services. Because biological diversity appears to play a substantial role in ecosystem resilience required to safeguard essential ecosystem functions in the face of environmental change, we call for a critical revision of common diversity assessments approaches. We advocate the reconsideration of the uncritical use of widespread measures and descriptors of biodiversity on grounds of inconsistent patterns found throughout numerous studies, including those presented herein. The complex nature of natural communities and the multiple aspects of biodiversity at different levels, make it necessary to incorporate processes acting on different organizational and spatial scales. When investigating the impacts of human-induced environmental changes on diverse vertebrate communities in the tropics, we should hence address compositional changes, as well as β-, and functional aspects of biodiversity. Special attention should also be drawn to the particular disturbance history of a given site and large scale cross-regional comparisons should be given priority. The consideration of these approaches in future studies would likely provide deeper insight in ecosystem processes at large scales and improve the effectiveness of current ecosystem management strategies. © 2007, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Amphibia; anthropogenic disturbance; communities; community dynamics; conservation; diversity; habitat alteration; logging; northern South America; predictability patterns; West Africa",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108439995

Conservationists decry proposed plans for logging and conversion of pristine tropical forest to oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). Although the local governments willing to declare the district a ""conservation district,"" at the same time it shows interest in oil palm conversion. This article explores the impact of the potential conversion of 500 000 ha of forest to oil palm on forest cover, inmigration, and the local economy in Malinau. The simulation model was developed using STELLA® software, and relies on a combination of empirical data, data from the literature, and stakeholder perceptions. If a company were to clear the forest for timber without planting oil palm (as commonly happens), poverty levels are likely to rise rather than decline over the long term. If large-scale oil palm plantations were to be established, they could yield significant benefits to local authorities. However, such development would induce massive employment-driven migration, with wide-ranging consequences for the current inhabitants of the region.

However, the disappearance and degradation of tropical forests both within and outside the borders of PAs (e.g. commercial logging and agricultural encroachment; Curran <italic>et al</italic>. 2004), continues to undermine their ecological value (Liu <italic>et al</italic>. 2001). It is therefore important to determine the conservation value and underpinnings of resource harvesting in PAs. Apparent conflicts between conservation and development could possibly have been avoided if biological and social knowledge were considered during land-use planning, including the design of PA networks (Terborgh <italic>et al</italic>. 2002; but see Kremen <italic>et al</italic>. 1999). Poor ecological and sociological data are impeding conservation efforts in Southeast Asia (Sodhi <italic>et al</italic>. 2004b). Southeast Asian biotas harbour high proportions of endemism (Myers <italic>et al</italic>. 2000) and the region is expected to suffer a loss of up to 21% of its biodiversity by 2100 if present deforestation rates continue (Brook <italic>et al</italic>. 2003). The Indonesian island of Sulawesi has extraordinary levels of endemic fauna (e.g. 61% and 34% of mammals and birds are endemic, respectively) and is experiencing both intensive human encroachment pressure in PAs and high deforestation rates (Sodhi & Brook 2006). Much of this negative impact, in part, stems from human resettlement close to the PA fringes as part of a nationwide transmigration project (Whitten <italic>et al</italic>. 2002). © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37749050389

These changes are related to a) changes in the supply of roundwood, b) globalisation and the opening of external markets for timber and other products like soy, c) increasing scarcity of timber, d) new markets and incentives for sustainable forest management and community-based forest management, and e) changes in forest land ownership, including the decentralisation of forest governance and devolution of forest land. We conclude that the changes are generating different effects. Whereas the expansion of external markets is leading to increased deforestation, the decentralisation and democratisation of forest governance and a global preoccupation with the loss of environmental services and livelihood opportunities for local people is creating new incentives for sustainable forest management. The greatest challenge is to find ways to make family-based logging and sawmill operations in settlement areas more sustainable, for instance through innovative company-community partnerships.","Amazon region; Forest governance; Soy cultivation; Sustainable forest management; Timber industry","Ros-Tonen, M.; Amsterdam Research Institute for Metropolitan and International Studies - AMIDst., Nieuwe Prinsengracht 130, NL-1018 VZ Amsterdam, Paises Baixos, Netherlands; email: m.a.f.ros-tonen@uva.nl",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-35448945247

This is no less true of dung-burying beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae), which provide a suite of critical ecosystem functions and services, yet but face multiple conservation threats, particularly from landscape conversion. Here we use a review and meta-analysis to synthesize the current knowledge concerning response to tropical forest modification and fragmentation of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae). For every modified habitat type and individual forest fragment across 33 studies, we calculated six dung beetle community parameters, standardized relative to intact tropical forest. We organized modified habitats along an approximate disturbance gradient ranging from selectively logged, late and early secondary forest, through agroforestry, tree plantations, to annual crops, cattle pastures and clear-cuts. Secondary forests, selectively logged forest and agroforests supported rich communities with many intact forest species, while cattle pastures and clear-cuts contained fewer species overall with few forest-dwelling species. Abundance generally declined with increasing modification, but was quite variable. Communities in open habitats were often characterized by hyper-abundance of a small number of small-bodied species, leading to low evenness. Across fragmentation studies, dung beetle species richness, abundance and evenness declined in smaller forest fragments. Richness and abundance sometimes declined in more isolated fragments, although this response appeared to depend on matrix quality. Across both habitat modification and fragmentation studies, geographic location and landscape context appeared to modify dung beetle response by influencing the available pool of colonists. We discuss potential underlying mechanisms and conclude with recommendations for management and conservation and for future research. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This study quantified and compared total harvested and damaged trees after logging operations carried out in East Kalimantan, Indonesia under two types of arrangements: 20-year commercial selective logging concessions, known as Hak Pengusahaan Hutan (HPH) and 1-year harvest permits intended for local communities, known as Ijin Pemungutan dan Pemanfaatan Kayu (IPPK). Sample plots of 20 ha were established in areas previously harvested by HPH and IPPK. Harvest levels were lower than those documented in other logging studies in Borneo, although it is possible that missing and therefore uncounted stumps of harvested trees in cleared areas (i.e. log landings and roads) and larger plots size may have underestimated harvest levels. Significant differences were found between HPH selective logging and IPPK permit holders (1 trees ha-1 and 4 trees ha-1, respectively). It was found that IPPK permit holders harvested a larger percentage of trees below 50 cm dbh than did HPH logging (&gt;25% as compared to 3%, respectively). IPPK permit holders operations also damaged twice as many residual trees below 50 cm dbh per unit area as did HPH harvests. However, HPH produced higher levels of damage per unit volume and number trees harvested, in terms of skid trail length, number of trees damaged, and canopy opening. The sum of the harvested and damaged trees, which may be lost from future harvest due to rot and mortality after harvesting, was significantly different under short-term permit holders and selective logging concessionaires (28 trees ha-1 versus 9 trees ha-1 in primary forest; 39 trees ha-1 versus 28 trees ha-1 in logged-over forest). Future harvest potential of the forest may be significantly lower with the influence of IPPK logging system, in terms of harvesting practices and logging damaged to the forest stands. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The objectives of this study were to determine throughfall, stemflow and rainfall interception in differently managed forest stands, and to relate the observed pattern of rainfall partitioning to stand structural characteristics. The study was conducted in a lower montane rainforest region (800-1140 m asl) in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Stands of four management types (natural forest, forest subject to small-diameter timber extraction, forest subject to selective logging of large-diameter timber, and cacao agroforest under trees remaining from the natural forest) were analyzed with three replicates per use type. The tree basal area decreased from the natural forest (52.5 m2 ha-1) to the agroforest (19.4 m2 ha-1) which was paralleled by a reduction in mean tree height (trees ≥ 10 cm dbh) from 21.3 to 17.5 m. The estimated leaf area index (LAI), as derived from hemispherical photos, averaged 6.2 m2 m-2 in the natural forest, 5.3 in forests with small timber extraction, 5.0 in forests with large timber extraction, and 5.3 in the agroforest. The annual gross precipitation close to our different study plots varied locally between 2437 and 3424 mm during the time of the study. Throughfall was measured on 15-17 rain days per plot with a median of 70% of gross precipitation over all the natural forest plots, 79 and 80% in forest with small and large timber extraction respectively, and 81% in the agroforest. Stemflow was less than 1% in all studied use types. Thus, rainfall interception was highest in the natural forest where 30% (median) of the gross precipitation was re-evaporated back into the atmosphere, and much lower in the three other use types (18-20%). Variability in structure and rainfall partitioning was high even within the same forest use types, thus further analysis focused on gradual changes rather than categories. In the 12 stands, LAI alone did not correlate significantly with the pattern of rainfall partitioning, the throughfall percentage increased significantly with decreasing tree height (r2 = 0.63). In a multiple linear regression with tree height and LAI as influencing factors, 81% of the variation in throughfall percentage is explained. A possible reason for this tree height-LAI-throughfall relationship is that under the conditions prevailing in our study region the canopy may not completely dry up between subsequent rainfall events. Therefore, the actual water storage at the start of a rainfall event would be below its potential. We hypothesize that tall trees increase the vertical distribution of foliage and other canopy components contributing to the canopy water storage, resulting in a higher canopy roughness and a more effective energy exchange with the atmosphere. This would consequently lead to an increased re-evaporation of intercepted water, larger available water storage and, thus, a reduced throughfall in stands with tall trees. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Five agents of change - road builders, corporate concession holders, community forest managers, park advocates, and urban consumers - have different effects on large forests in remote tropical regions than they do on remnant forests in settled agricultural regions. Because forests vary so much in size across tropical regions, these differences in the effects of agents on forests have important implications for regional conservation efforts. To make these implications explicit, I compared the effects of the five agents in regions with large forests with their effects in regions with small forests. The comparisons indicated that, as forests declined in size, new roads no longer destroyed forests, corporate loggers left the forests, community forest managers became more effective, parks became less feasible as a means of conservation, and urban consumers initiated tree planting.

In the Amazon, reduced-impact logging results in significantly less damage than conventional unplanned logging; yet either logging method leads to substantial fragmentation of the forest canopy. Increased mortality rates of trees damaged in logging have been documented. In this paper, we investigate the effect of logging disturbance on treefall rates. Using repeat inventories of canopy trees (≥35 cm dbh) in six large (≥50-ha) forest stands at two sites in the eastern Amazon, we measured mortality rates in three treatment classes: unlogged, conventionally logged (CL) and logged using reduced-impact methods (RIL). At least 3000 trees were mapped and inventoried per stand prior to timber harvests. In the second inventory, 3 years after harvests in the logged stands, all trees were located and scored as living, standing dead, uprooted or broken. We found significantly higher overall mortality rates for trees in logged forest (both CL and RIL stands) than in adjacent unlogged forest. This effect was largely due to higher rates of treefall (i.e., stems uprooted or broken from natural causes). Moreover, significantly higher treefall rates were recorded for trees in logged forest that were not damaged in the logging than for trees in unlogged stands. Treefall rates were nearly twice as high in conventionally logged forest as in forest logged using reduced-impact methods. We found indirect support for the hypothesis that increased treefall rates in logged forest are related to increased canopy opening and fragmentation through analysis of the locations of fallen trees in relation to canopy disturbance. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We have examined this hypothesis by observing differences in biodiversity of terrestrial isopods along a gradient of disturbance from two undisturbed primary tropical rainforest sites, to a logged site, a mixed native fruit orchard and a commercial oil palm plantation, in Sabah, East Malaysia. We describe a standardised protocol for the rapid assessment of isopod biodiversity on tropical forest floor sites and for measuring environmental variables to which we have related differences in species richness and relative abundance of the isopods. The results do not support Connell's hypothesis because there were no significant differences in diversity, species richness or equitability between disturbed sites and the nearest primary forests. The relative abundance of individual species was highest in the most disturbed environment. We suggest that this may be because particular species are well adapted to exploiting resources under the more 'r' selection conditions created by disturbance. Possible reasons for why the observations do not conform with predictions from the intermediate disturbance hypothesis are discussed. We conclude that Huston's dynamic equilibrium model is more appropriate than the intermediate disturbance hypothesis in predicting the effects of disturbance of tropical rainforests on these arthropod macro-decomposers. © 2006.","Deforestation; Diversity; Dynamic equilibrium hypothesis; Equitability; Logging; Species richness; Tropical rain forest","Hassall, M.; Centre for Ecology Evolution and Conservation, , Norwich, NR4 7JT, United Kingdom; email: m.hassall@uea.ac.uk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845325826

Absolute values of FD were higher in South American anuran communities, despite higher species richness in West African communities. FD was higher in older recovery, as compared to younger recovery states, even though species-diversity did not differ significantly. Three major conclusions can be drawn from our results. 1. Scale matters: it is important to monitor different levels of biodiversity in order to reveal its actual loss after anthropogenic disturbance. 2. Time matters: the disturbance history of a site is important in order to detect patterns that otherwise remain unnoticed. 3. Geographic history matters at the local scale: whereas general patterns at higher diversity levels were identical in both eco-regions, species richness, species diversity and turnover patterns differed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of logging activity on Ks at five subsurface depths (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 m) on the non-roaded portion of the harvest area were examined at the three following sites, which differed in the degree of disturbance and recovery since timber harvesting: (1) selective logging conducted in the 1960s; (2) mechanized selective tree removal conducted 4 years ago; and (3) high-impact clear-cutting just prior to measurement. This recent logging greatly disturbed the soil surface (via compaction, topsoil/subsoil mixing, burning) and produced comparatively high variability in near-surface Ks. Changes in Ks at or below 0.25-m, however, were not detected with certainty at any sites. In terms of hillslope hydrologic response, the connectivity of zones of low Ks in the harvest area with dense networks of skid trails and terraces was identified as one of the most important consequences of timber harvesting, although this phenomenon was not quantified.

We present density estimates, derived using a point count distance sampling method, for 31 bird species in primary forest, old abandoned gardens and active/recently abandoned gardens at two altitudes in the Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area (CMWMA), Papua New Guinea. There were clear habitat differences between the six habitat/altitude categories, with, for example, clines in tree sizes and canopy cover from highest values in primary forest to lowest values in current gardens. At lower altitudes, primary forest held highest densities of most species, whereas at higher altitudes, old abandoned gardens had greater densities of many birds, especially insectivores. canoco was used to ordinate bird species with respect to major habitat gradient axes. Major axes were associated with differences in bird responses to forest conversion as well as altitudinal differences in species composition. Most important was that several insectivores (especially monarchs, fantails, etc.) formed a cluster of species associated with intact, high-biomass forest. We suggest that most species reacted moderately to habitat changes currently occurring, and this may be due in part to the fact that only a small proportion of the landscape at CMWMA has been converted to agriculture (around 13% may be current or recently abandoned gardens).

Our objectives were to (1) compare bat abundance, species composition, and feeding guild structure between unlogged and low-intensity selectively logged (1-4 logged stems/ha) sampling grids in the southeastern Amazon and (2) examine correlations between logging-induced changes in bat communities and forest structure. We captured bats in understory and canopy mist nets set in five 1-ha study grids in both logged and unlogged forest. We captured 996 individuals, representing 5 families, 32 genera, and 49 species. Abundances of nectarivorous and frugivorous taxa (Glossophaginae, Lonchophyllinae, Stenodermatinae, and Carolliinae) were higher at logged sites, where canopy openness and understory foliage density were greatest. In contrast, insectivorous and omnivorous species (Emballonuridae, Mormoopidae, Phyllostominae, and Vespertilionidae) were more abundant in unlogged sites, where canopy foliage density and variability in the understory stratum were greatest. Multivariate analyses indicated that understory bat species composition differed strongly between logged and unlogged sites but provided little evidence of logging effects for the canopy fauna. Different responses among feeding guilds and taxonomic groups appeared to be related to foraging and echolocation strategies and to changes in canopy cover and understory foliage densities.

Long-term population dynamics datasets are typically unavailable in many developing countries, and then perhaps only for one to few high profile taxa. Given the scale and urgency of sustainability issues, one-off inventories provide the only realistic means for assessing the population status and harvest potential of assemblages of target resource species. Quantitative examples of such assessments are very rare, and limited in scale. As part of a national programme focusing on developing sustainable usage of medicinal plants in five biogeographically representative Medicinal Plant Conservation Areas (MPCAs) in Sri Lanka, we describe the rapid appraisal methodology developed for, and substantive results derived from, a resource inventory undertaken at respective MPCAs to provide: (a) baseline assessment of the distributions, associated population structures and densities, and ecological requirements of medicinal plant species; and (b) an informed basis for ongoing in situ conservation, management, and harvest sustainability of defined priority medicinal plant species. The applied methodology comprised: (a) quantitative assessment of medicinal plant populations and habitat features at 898 inventory plots, located using a strict hierarchical stratification; (b) standard numerical classificatory procedures to define major habitat types; and (c) areal estimates of habitats based on available fine-scale topographic mapping, augmented with refined mapping derived from Landsat TM imagery. Over 1400 medicinal plant species (ca. 40% of the national flora) were sampled during the inventory, occurring in habitat conditions ranging from dense-canopied, relatively undisturbed tropical forest, to savanna. Most vegetation was of a secondary nature reflecting ancient and varied histories of chena (slash and burn) cultivation, grassland/savanna burning for pastoral purposes, and recent logging. Medicinal plant species density was significantly correlated overall with higher rainfall, higher elevation, deeper and more acid soils. Derived population estimates and structures, and the potential for sustainable harvest from the wild, are assessed for 34 priority medicinal plant species. Results demonstrate the very low resource base of most priority species, and the varied habitat and disturbance requirements of medicinal plants in Sri Lankan reserves. It follows that (a) greater attention needs to be given to ex situ propagation and farming of medicinal plant resources-although for many long-lived perennial taxa this is likely to be impractical; (b) there can be no one management prescription which caters for all component species; and (c) for effective conservation local communities need to be actively involved in managing natural vegetation habitats (albeit under regulated conditions), including imposition of various forms of small-scale disturbances such as harvesting and, where appropriate, fire management. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Using extensive high-resolution satellite analyses, we studied the forest damage caused by recent logging operations and the likelihood that logged forests would be cleared within 4 years after timber harvest. Across 2,030,637 km2 of the Brazilian Amazon from 1999 to 2004, at least 76% of all harvest practices resulted in high levels of canopy damage sufficient to leave forests susceptible to drought and fire. We found that 16 ±1% of selectively logged areas were deforested within 1 year of logging, with a subsequent annual deforestation rate of 5.4% for 4 years after timber harvests. Nearly all logging occurred within 25 km of main roads, and within that area, the probability of deforestation for a logged forest was up to four times greater than for unlogged forests. In combination, our results show that logging in the Brazilian Amazon is dominated by highly damaging operations, often followed rapidly by deforestation decades before forests can recover sufficiently to produce timber for a second harvest.

A simulation of current management regulations based upon a maximum extracted volume of 35 m3 ha-1 and a 30-year cutting cycle was found to be unsustainable. A range of alternative specifications for the control (regulation) of harvested timber yield were compared, along with associated estimates of timber increment and description of the ecological composition of the stand. The alternative scenarios included cutting cycles ranging from 10 to 60 years and maximum yields from 10 to 40 m3 ha-1. The maximum commercial volume increment predicted in this study was 0.33 m3 ha-1. It was observed that the highest rates of volume increment were associated with high logging intensities. The study produced a limited number of potentially sustainable options for the Tapajós forest. The best of these were the combinations of 10 m3 ha-1 yield and a cutting cycle of 30 years or 20 m3 ha-1 with a 60-year cutting cycle. The analysis suggested that the sustainability of both of these options was ""marginal"" and suggested adopting a precautionary approach of an additional limit for yield to be no more than 33% of standing commercial volume until more data are available. Analysis of the ecological data from the simulations clearly demonstrated that the composition of the managed forest is likely to differ significantly from that observed in primary forest. The most significant likely change is a reduction in the proportion of trees in the emergent ecological group. This observation raises the issue that stakeholders should not expect tropical forests that are managed for production to ever be identical in structure or composition to primary forests. It also suggests that additional technical measures will be required to promote the regeneration and growth of current emergent species if these are to be maintained in managed forests in the Amazon. The study concludes that there cannot be a single system of yield regulation or forest management that will fit all contexts (social, ecological, environmental and economic) or management objectives held by various stakeholders in the Amazon. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Most sustainable forest management practices avoid clear-cuts and apply selective logging systems focused on a few commercial species. We applied a simulation model to estimate the impact of such selective logging scenarios on the genetic diversity and demography of four tropical tree species from French Guiana. The simulations used data on genetic and demographic composition, growth, phenology and pollen and seed dispersal obtained for Dicorynia guianensis, Sextonia rubra, Symphonia globulifera and Vouacapoua americana at the experimental site in Paracou. Whereas Symphonia globulifera serves as a model for a species with low logging pressure, the other three species represent the most exploited tree species in French Guiana. In simulations with moderate logging, typical for French Guiana, with large cutting diameter (>60 cm diameter) and long cutting cycles (65 years), the two species V. americana and Sextonia rubra were not able to recover their initial stock at the end of the rotation period, with a large decrease in the number of individuals and in basal area. Under a more intensive logging system (cutting diameter >45 cm diameter, cutting cycles of 30 years) that is common practice in the Brazilian Amazon, only Symphonia globulifera showed no negative impact. Generally, the differences between the genetic parameters in the control scenarios without logging and the logging scenarios were surprisingly small. The main reasons for this were the overlapping of generations and the effective dispersal ability of gene vectors in all species, which guarantee relative homogeneity of the genetic structure in different age classes. Nevertheless, decreasing the population size by logging reduced the number of genotypes and caused higher genetic distances between the original population and the population at the end of the logging cycles. Sensitivity analysis showed that genetic changes in the logging scenarios were principally determined by the growth, densities and cutting diameter of each species, and only to a very small extent by the reproductive system including factors such as pollen and seed dispersal and flowering phenology. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we assess those thresholds and characteristics within the context of selective logging in the Bolivian Amazon. Our study combined field measurements of the spatial and temporal dynamics of felling gaps and skid trails ranging from &lt;1 to 19 months following reduced-impact logging in a forest in lowland Bolivia with remote-sensing measurements from simultaneous monthly ASTER satellite overpasses. A probabilistic spectral mixture model (AutoMCU) was used to derive per-pixel fractional cover estimates of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil. Results were compared with the normalized difference in vegetation index (NDVI). The forest studied had considerably lower basal area and harvest volumes than logged sites in the Brazilian Amazon where similar remote-sensing analyses have been performed. Nonetheless, individual felling-gap area was positively correlated with canopy openness, percentage liana coverage, rates of vegetation regrowth, and height of remnant NPV. Both liana growth and NPV occurred primarily in the crown zone of the felling gap, whereas exposed soil was limited to the trunk zone of the gap. In felling gaps &gt;400 m2, NDVI, and the PV and NPV fractions, were distinguishable from unlogged forest values for up to six months after logging; felling gaps &lt;400 m2 were distinguishable for up to three months after harvest, but we were entirely unable to distinguish skid trails from our analysis of the spectral data. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","ASTER; Bolivian Amazon; Felling gaps; Forest disturbance; Forest structure; NDVI; Remote-sensing monitoring; Selective logging; Skid trails; Spectral mixture analysis; Timber harvest; Tropical forest","Zarin, D.J.; School of Forest Resources and Conservation, , Gainesville, FL 32611, United States; email: djzarin@mail.ifas.ufl.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746009583

We found that the orchid was not present in an area of the plot which had <20 percent canopy cover in 1936, and was most abundant in the area with >80 percent canopy cover, which had been minimally impacted by human activity. Tree species composition varied among land-use history areas, and our observations suggested that this variation might be influencing the local distribution of W. calcarata. We also measured leaf litter biomass and identified the leaves of litter in areas with and without the orchid. Litter with a high proportion of Buchenavia tetraphylla leaves had more orchids. Even though human disturbance ceased in 1932, land-use history in the Luquillo Forest still casts a shadow over the distribution of W. calcarata. © 2006 The Author(s).","Biodiversity recovery; Caribbean; Conservation; Forest disturbance; Luquillo Mountains; Orchidaceae; Plant distribution; Tropical wet forest","Ackerman, J.D.; Department of Biology, PO Box 23360, San Juan, 00931-3360, Puerto Rico; email: jdackermar@uprrp.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745037251

Recent decades have seen a rapid proliferation of human activities, with striking tensions between logging and conservation economies. Our data suggest that certain animals and humans initially adapted successfully to these forest uses, and that local residents have crafted culturally rich new ways of living in the forest. However, our longitudinal data indicate animal declines and expanding frontiers of increasingly intensive human use. These trends are altering previous territorial arrangements and coming to undermine today's remarkably rich spectrum of human-animal encounters there. Our combined approach offers an alternative to increasingly distinct method and theory between anthropology's subfields.

We assess whether recent radical changes in forestry laws in Peru will result in significant improvements in logging practices. We adapt North's conceptual framework of institutional change to analyze the impact of governance on loggers' norms and argue that improvements in logging practices will require changes in both laws and norms. The analysis uses survey and field evaluation data on logging practices in Peru, as well as secondary sources. Results show that bringing about radical changes in logging practices is particularly difficult in countries with a history of governance failures in the timber sector. In Peru, governance failures that have promoted norms inconsistent with good management are government's perceived lack of interest in long-term timber management, inconsistent forestry laws, perceived discrimination against the timber sector, and ineffective law enforcement. As a result of decades of these governance failures, loggers developed a short-term perspective on timber extraction and felt entitled to violate government's laws. Poor logging practices continued under the new law because of governance failures. The Peruvian experience shows that changing laws radically is often easier than avoiding governance failures in implementation. While some governance failures were partially rectified, others assumed added significance under the provisions of the new law. Decentralization also exacerbated existing and new governance problems. These failures reinforced existing norms and may, in addition, lead to norms condoning corruption. Modifications need to occur both in norms and in logging laws to reduce the inconsistency between the two. Notable improvements in governance will be required to bring about changes in norms. Changes in the logging system are therefore likely to be far less revolutionary, and to take far longer, than envisioned. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

These slight to heavy disturbances affect aboveground forest structure by reducing wood biomass and canopy cover; however, they may also have a profound impact on the belowground compartment. In a lower montane moist forest of Central Sulawesi, we studied the profile totals of fine root biomass (FRBtot, roots &lt;2 mm until 50 cm of soil depth) and of fine root necromass (FRN tot), the vertical distribution of fine root mass, and the fine root live/dead ratio by root coring in 12 forest stands that represented a gradient in forest use (or disturbance) intensity (forest use type A: undisturbed natural forest, B and C: slightly or moderately disturbed forests with selective timber extraction, D: heavily disturbed cacao agroforest systems under a remaining rainforest cover; each forest types being replicated three times). FRB tot decreased significantly from forest A to the disturbed B, C and D forests, and reached less than 60% of the FRBtot value of A in the agroforest systems D. A similar decrease with increasing disturbance intensity was found for FRNtot. Forest disturbance intensity had no significant influence on the vertical distribution of fine root biomass in the profiles. According to correlation and principal components analyses, fractional canopy cover was the most important factor influencing FRBtot and FRN tot, whereas diameter at breast height, stand basal area, stem density, soil pH and base saturation had only a minor or no influence on root mass. A reduction in canopy cover from 90% (forest type A) to 75% (types C and D) was associated with a reduction in FRBtot by about 45% which indicates that timber extraction leads not only to canopy gaps but to corresponding 'root gaps' in the soil as well. We conclude that forest encroachment that is widespread in large parts of South-east Asia's remaining rainforests significantly reduces tree fine root biomass and associated carbon sequestration, even if it is conducted at moderate intensities only. © Springer 2006.","Agroforestry; Canopy gaps; Disturbance intensity; Fine root biomass; Selective logging; Vertical root distribution","Leuschner, C.; Plant Ecology, , D-37073, Göttingen, Germany; email: cleusch@uni-goettingen.de",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746070049

Generally, growth rates of commercial tropical tree species are derived from repeated measurements in permanent sample plots. Here, we present an alternative method: the use of tree ring analysis. It has some important advantages over plot studies. The aims of this study were (1) to demonstrate how tree ring analysis can be helpful to tropical forest management and (2) to evaluate future timber yields under Bolivian forestry legislation. To this end, we collected stem discs of 17-60 harvested trees of each of four commercial tree species in the Bolivian Amazon and reconstructed their lifetime growth trajectories through ring measurements. Using ring analysis, we calculated age estimates of harvested trees and size distributions of potential crop trees for the next harvest. Timber yields at the next harvest were estimated by projecting ingrowth of trees to harvestable sizes during a cutting cycle of 20 years (as set by Bolivian regulations) using the growth data obtained from tree ring analysis. This was done in two ways: by looking forward and project ingrowth in 20 years based on densities of trees below the minimum cutting size (""prospective analysis""), and by looking backwards using densities of trees above the harvest limit to calculate their size 20 years ago (""retrospective analysis""). Both methods yielded low recuperation of initially harvested volume for all four species (generally 20-30%). Thus, initial timber yields of our study species cannot be sustained with a logging cycle of 20 years. We discuss the advantages of tree ring analysis over growth rates obtained from permanent sample plot data. First, age estimates are calculated directly - not based on simulations - and are therefore more accurate. Second, growth rates obtained from ring data of canopy trees are representative for those trees that successfully reached the canopy, and do not include the probably slower-growing individuals that are less likely to reach the canopy. Third, the lifetime growth patterns obtained from ring data allow for accurate assessment of variation among trees in long-term growth and incorporating this intra-specific long-term growth variation resulted in higher and more accurate estimates of timber yield. Finally, we argue that ring analysis should be added to the toolbox of research methods for tropical forest management, but without substituting the monitoring of permanent sample plots, which provides relevant information on forest structure, damage and growth rates of non-ring forming tree species. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In the Ituri Forest of DRC, as in other tropical forest areas, road creation associated with selective logging results in spontaneous human colonization, leading to the clearing of mature forest for agricultural purposes. Following 1-3 years of cultivation, farmlands are left fallow for periods that may exceed 20 years, resulting in extensive secondary forest areas impacted by both selective logging and swidden agriculture. In this study, we assessed forest structure, tree species composition and diversity and the regeneration of timber trees in secondary forest stands (5-10 and ~40 years old), selectively logged forest stands, and undisturbed forests at two sites in the Ituri region. Stem density was lower in old secondary forests (∼40 years old) than in either young secondary or mature forests. Overall tree diversity did not significantly differ between forest types, but the diversity of trees ≥10 cm dbh was substantially lower in young secondary forest stands than in old secondary or mature forests. The species composition of secondary forests differed from that of mature forests, with the dominant Caesalpinoid legume species of mature forests poorly represented in secondary forests. However, in spite of prior logging, the regeneration of high value timber trees such as African mahoganies (Khaya anthotheca and Entandrophragma spp.) was at least 10 times greater in young secondary forests than in mature forests. We argue that, if properly managed and protected, secondary forests, even those impacted by both selective logging and small-scale shifting agriculture, may have high potential conservation and economic value. © Springer 2006.","Forest composition; Ituri Forest; Secondary forest; Selective logging; Shifting cultivation; Timber tree regeneration; Tree diversity","Thomas, S.C.; University of Toronto, 33 Willcocks Street, Toronto, Ont.

However, many parks lack adequate management to address environmental degradation. To improve management strategies simple tools are needed for an assessment of human impact and management effectiveness of protected areas. This study quantifies the current threats in the heavily fragmented and degraded tropical rainforest of Kakamega, western Kenya. We recorded seven disturbance parameters at 22 sites in differently managed and protected areas of Kakamega Forest. Our data indicate a high level of human impact throughout the forest with illegal logging being most widespread. Furthermore, logging levels appear to reflect management history and effectiveness. From 1933 to 1986, Kakamega Forest was under management by the Forest Department and the number of trees logged more than 20 years ago was equally high at all sites. Since 1986, management of Kakamega Forest has been under two different organizations, i.e. Forest Department and Kenya Wildlife Service. The number of trees logged illegally in the last 20 years was significantly lower at sites managed by the Kenya Wildlife Service. Finally, logging was lower within highly protected National and Nature Reserves as compared to high logging within the less protected Forest Reserves. Reflecting management effectiveness as well as protection status in Kakamega Forest, logging might therefore provide a valuable quantitative indicator for human disturbance and thus an important tool for conservation managers. Logging might be a valuable indicator for other protected areas, too, however, other human impact such as e.g. hunting might also prove to be a potential indicator. © Springer 2006.","Conservation; Disturbance indicator; Forest degradation; Logging; Management","Bleher, B.; Institut für Zoologie, Becherweg 13, 55099 Mainz, Germany; email: b_bleher@web.de",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745442838

Despite this, there are very few experimental catchment studies that quantify the hydrological impacts of specific tropical forestry operations. While new field studies are imperative, more could be gained from existing catchment studies by extracting information from the available time-series. Data Based Mechanistic (DBM) models can be used to extract hydrological information from such time-series by fitting a range of Transfer Function models using the simplified recursive instrumental variable (SRIV) algorithm and without a priori assumptions about the water pathways. An optimal model and its associated hydrological system parameters are then identified from objective statistical measures (e.g. Rt2, YIC) and only then by selection of that model with the most plausible physical explanation. While the DBM method has been applied to the relationship between rainfall input and streamflow output in tropical rainforests, it has never been used to simultaneously examine the relationships within rainfall-streamflow data and the component water pathways of overland flow, subsurface flow and transpiration. Modelling these component pathways is important to the understanding of likely changes in the rainfall-streamflow behaviour resulting from tropical forestry. We aim to show the value of our multiple component DBM models to simulate the sensitivity of stream behaviour to different densities of skidder vehicle trails within a managed rainforest in Borneo. The first application of DBM modelling to the component water pathways of an equatorial rainforest catchment shows that the overall rainfall-streamflow response is flashy, with a residence time of 36.25 ± 0.19 min, when compared to other small catchments, but on minor aquifers. The overall response is, however, much less flashy in comparison to the infiltration-excess overland flow pathway which has a residence time of only 5.50 ± 0.09 min. The overland flow pathway is also less non-linear in its response in comparison to the subsurface pathway and overall response. A new DBM model of transpiration was found, and was similarly shown to give a rapid dynamic response to the input variable, in this case air temperature. The DBM approach indicated that higher order models (e.g. multiple subsurface pathways) were not statistically identifiable within any of the high frequency, 12-month time-series modelled. The first application of DBM modelling to land use/change scenarios in the same equatorial rainforest catchment suggested that the majority of the stream behaviour, in a period 7-years after selective logging, is insensitive to the skid trail densities associated with reduced impact logging (RIL) or clearfell systems in Malaysia. This is largely because of the relative insignificance of the overland flow pathway and the fact that changes in this pathway are predicted to occur on the rising stage of stream hydrographs, rather than at the more critical peak. While controversial, this result is consistent with our previous findings which show that some forestry impacts on hydrology are exaggerated in the popular perception. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Time series analysis of satellite imagery provides an ideal means of quantifying landscape change and identifying the pathways which lead to the changes. This study investigates the forest and land cover changes by classifying Landsat MSS (Multispectral Scanner), TM (Thematic Mapper) and ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) images over three time periods (1983-90, 1990-98, and 1998-2000), creating land cover maps for each year and change trajectories for each year-pair. The study area chosen covers an area of 2160 km2 of undulating topography and alluvial plains in the East Kutai District of East Kalimantan Province, which in the 1980s was covered mostly with lowland dipterocarp forest; today the landscape is a patchwork dominated by oil palm and timber plantations and degraded forest. We relate land cover change data to land use allocation and to fire impacts based on fire hotspot distribution and fire damage information. The multidate land cover change trajectories provide an insight into the forest loss and degradation pathways over the 17-year period spanning the first entry of commercial logging concessionaires, followed by a government-sponsored transmigration scheme, government-licensed timber and oil palm plantations and, finally, the devastating fires of 1998. The results show a mean deforestation rate of 42km2 or 6 per cent per year for 1983-2000, rising to 10 per cent per year for 1990-98; by 2000, 70 per cent of forest initially damaged by fire and drought during the 1982-83 El Niño event was classified as non-forest.

However, further advances in the use of Landsat to study and monitor tropical forests and protected areas are threatened by the scan line corrector failure on the ETM+ sensor, as well as uncertainty about the continuity of the Landsat mission. Given these problems, this paper illustrates how ETM+ data were used in an interdisciplinary study that effectively monitored forest cover change in Gunung Palung National Park in West Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. Following 31 May 2003, when the ETM+ sensor's scan line corrector failed, we analysed how this failure impedes our ability to perform a similar study from this date onwards. This analysis uses six simulated post-scan line corrector failure (SLC-off) images and reveals that data gaps caused by SLC-off introduce maximum errors of 1.47 per cent and 4.04 per cent in estimates of forest cover and rates of forest loss, respectively.

This paper presents an overview of the satellite systems that can be used for operational forest monitoring in the tropics and examines some recent trends in their use. It also reviews various satellite-based studies to map moist tropical forests and draws upon lessons learned from land cover mapping projects in several countries and regions. The case of Indonesia, examined as a nation undergoing rapid conversion of forest to other land uses, is contrasted with Brazil where satellite-based deforestation monitoring is fully operational. In Indonesia, the paper argues, the creation of a national monitoring system for tropical forest conversion is needed to create a source of transparent, reliable information on forest cover and condition. Such a system is likely to succeed if based on multitemporal, moderate-resolution optical data such as imagery provided by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer). When MODIS images are complemented by radar and fine-resolution imagery from sensors such as IKONOS and QuickBird, areas of abrupt change can be identified and the causes potentially discerned. Thus, satellite imagery at multiple temporal and spatial resolutions can effectively increase transparency in the forestry sector by revealing the rate and extent of deforestation on an annual basis and identifying potential areas of illegal logging. © 2006 Department of Geography, National University of Singapore and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Forest monitoring; Indonesia; MODIS; Remote sensing; Tropical deforestation","Fuller, D.O.; Department of Geography and Regional Studies, , Miami, FL, United States; email: dofuller@miami.edu",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748052086

Successful management depends on understanding factors governing tree recruitment during succession. Recruits can be on-site propagules surviving disturbance (e.g. saplings) or seeds arriving after disturbance. Among disturbed sites, the importance of seed arrival from off-site should increase as availability of on-site propagules declines. This study examines how seed arrival from off-site seemed to influence natural forest regrowth on logged plantations in Uganda. Specifically, the effect of seed arrival from mammals (determined directly) and birds (determined inferentially) was estimated in two plantations with high and three plantations with low quantities of saplings surviving logging. In both plantation types, first-year recruitment seemed to originate from on-site (seed bank and sprouts from damaged trees) and off-site sources (seed-dispersing birds). Recruitment declined 2-3 years after logging in all plantations despite high densities of seed-dispersing birds. Recruitment was generally greater in plantations with low initial quantities of on-site propagules, and by 4-6 years forest structure was similar between plantation types. Recruitment was dominated by bird-dispersed species, rather than mammal- or wind-dispersed species. Taken together, these results illustrate that disturbed areas with low initial on-site propagule availability have much potential for forest regrowth. © Springer 2006.","Disturbance; Frugivores; Plantations; Restoration; Secondary forests; Seed dispersal; Succession; Tropical forests","Duncan, R.S.; Birmingham-Southern College, 900 Arkadelphia Rd., Birmingham, AL 35254, United States; email: sduncan@bsc.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644599155

The current distribution of T. schlegelii extends over lowland regions of eastern Sumatra, Kalimantan and western Java (Indonesia), Sarawak, and. Peninsular Malaysia, Vietnam and. Thailand, within 5 degrees north and south of the equator. Additional records from Sabah (Borneo) and Thailand are unconfirmed, and early records from Thailand may have originated from regions currently within Peninsular Malaysia. The Pliocene to early Pleistocene distribution of T. schlegelii was apparently much broader than its historical range, and extended over lowland river systems of Indonesia, Malaysia and into southern China. Since the discovery of the species in 1838, a significant decline in the density of populations throughout range states has occurred, more markedly since the 1940s. Ironically, the broad outlines of the original distribution seem, to have remained. A large portion of the records appear to be associated with peat swamp forest, a highly threatened category of tropical forest, suggesting that a decline in abundance is related to habitat loss. Current areas in which the species appears to still maintain reasonable levels of abundance are in southern. Sumatra, west Kalimantan and southcentral Kalimantan, although some smaller protected populations occur in central Sarawak. Current T. schlegelii breeding habitats are under threat throughout range states as a result of the progressive draining, logging, burning and. clearing of swamp forests. © National University of Singapore.","Crocodilian; False gharial; Peat swamp; Tomistoma","Stuebing, R.

Lianas are characteristic of many tropical forests, where they contribute to species diversity, ecosystem functioning, and biomass. However, lianas can also impede timber production by increasing logging damage and slowing tree growth. Cutting lianas prior to logging can mitigate the negative effects, but may adversely affect a forest's value for conservation. To evaluate the effects of forest management activities on lianas, this study assessed the impacts of logging, both with and without pre-logging liana cutting, on the relative abundance and population structure of five species of lianas that differed in primary reproductive strategies. Inventories of the five study species were conducted 10 years following logging in 4.4 ha plots in three adjacent treatment areas: (1) an old-growth forest reserve, (2) a selectively-logged forest that used conventional practices for the region, and (3) a forest that was logged using reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques including complete liana cutting prior to logging. Liana species responses to logging varied according to their primary modes of reproduction. Croton ascendens, a pioneer species with a persistent seed bank, had a higher abundance in the two logging treatments relative to the old-growth forest, while Serjania caracasana, an early successional species lacking a persistent seed bank, showed abundant regeneration following conventional logging but negligible regeneration following RIL. In contrast, Acacia multipinnata, also an early successional species, showed abundant regeneration following RIL owing to the sprouting of persistent prostrate stems present on the forest floor prior to logging. In both logged areas, Bauhinia guianensis recruited abundant climbing stems from self-supporting seedlings that were present prior to logging, but it showed greatly reduced seedling density following RIL. By sprouting profusely from both fallen stems and stumps, Memora schomburgkii recruited abundant small-diameter climbing stems in both of the logging treatments. The results of this study demonstrate that there are interspecific differences in liana responses to different types of logging and that knowing species' primary modes of reproduction is a valuable first step toward predicting those responses. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, recent studies demonstrate that tree regeneration following logging can be slow, decreasing the conservation value of disturbed forests. Here we test whether the dominating herb, Acanthus pubescens, in the understory of logged forest, suppresses tree regeneration in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We compare the establishment, growth, and survival of tree seedlings over 2.5 years between sites cleared of A. pubescens and controls. We also consider the role of elephants (Loxodonta africana) in inhibiting tree regeneration. Seedling abundance and species richness was greater in cleared than control plots at the start of the study. Seedling abundance decreased over the study, but remained greater in cleared than control plots. Species richness did not vary over the study. However, species composition of the cleared plots was marginally different from control plots at the start, but converged on the composition of control plots by the end of the study. This suggests a common regeneration assemblage derived from reorganisation of species, rather than recruitment of new species. There was no difference in recruitment rates between cleared and control plots. These findings suggest no strong direct effects of the herb on tree regeneration in this disturbed forest. However, when we modelled (i.e., removed) the effect of elephants on regeneration, the abundance of seedlings increased in both plot types and remained reasonably constant over time. The decline in density of regenerating stems over the study was most likely caused by elephants visiting the plots. We conclude that elephants have a far greater effect in suppressing tree regeneration at Kibale than the herb stratum and are ultimately responsible for arresting succession in disturbed forest. However, as intensive logging creates conditions favourable for A. pubescens, which is eaten by elephants, the best management intervention is to constrain logging intensities to below levels above which widespread establishment of A. pubescens is promoted, thus limiting elephant activity in regenerating areas. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

As a case study, we examined the extractive logging of the mangrove Rhizophora mangle in the Río Limón area of Lake Maracaibo, in western Venezuela. The ecological definition of sustainable harvesting is harvesting that allows population numbers to be maintained or to increase over time. In interviews, the harvesters defined sustainable harvesting as levels permitting the maintenance of the mangrove population over two human generations, about 50 yr. In Río Limón, harvesters extract a combination of small adult and juvenile trees. Harvesting rates ranged from 7-35% of small adult trees. These harvesting levels would be sustainable according to the harvester's definition as long as juvenile harvesting was less than 40%. However, some harvesting levels that would be sustainable according to the harvesters were ecologically unsustainable, i.e., eventually causing declines in mangrove population numbers. It was also determined that the structure of mangrove forests was significantly affected by harvesting; even areas harvested at low, ecologically sustainable intensities had significantly fewer adult trees than undisturbed sites. Western Venezuela has no organized timber industry, so mangrove logs are used in many types of construction. A lagging economy and a lack of alternative construction materials make mangrove harvesting inevitable, and for local people, an economic necessity. This creates a trade-off between preserving the ecological characteristics of the mangrove population and responding to human needs. In order to resolve this situation, we recommended a limited and adaptive mangrove harvesting regime. We also suggest that harvesters could participate in community-based management programs as harvesting monitors. Copyright © 2006 by the author(s).

Ensuring SY of some species, i.e., a ""strong sustainability"" paradigm, could be an inadequate criterion if consideration of the social and economic components of the SFM concept are desired. SFM was translated into the ATO/ITTO set of principles criteria, and indicators (PCI) for forest management in the Congo Basin; it resulted in the necessity for a certified logging company to ensure that no significant change in structure and floristic composition would result from logging operations. Besides raising the question of where to place the change threshold, we argue that sustainability must be considered from three indissociable viewpoints: ecological, social, and economic. The issue is how to balance these criteria, knowing that this assessment will involve potential conflicts of representations and beliefs. To discuss these questions, we used the example of two heavily logged timber species in the Congo Basin, sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum) and ayous (Triplochiton scleroxylon). Using long-term data collected from permanent sample plots in M'Baïki, Central African Republic, we calibrated a matrix model and performed short- and long-term simulations to examine (1) the potential effect of repeated logging of the species under the current national regulation system and (2) the rules that should be set to reach long-term SY. Ensuring long-term SY would require a 22% and 53% decrease in the felling intensity of E. cylindricum and T. scleroxylon, respectively, at first cut, together with an increase in overall logging intensity targeted toward less-used species. Light-demanding E. cylindricum and T. scleroxylon require open forests to regenerate and grow. This new set of rules is probably economically unsustainable for the current African forest industry, and will not meet the ecological requirements encapsulated in the ATO/ITTO PCI. We thus stress the following points: (1) the importance of most exploited species for the current industry may change as wood processing capacities become more efficient and markets change, potentially providing conditions for harvesting a greater number of species; (2) floristic change is unavoidable in these conditions, but this problem should be addressed at a broad scale, notably by ensuring a network of protected areas; (3) as long as the timber industry remains one of the few sources of employment and revenues in marginalized countries, reducing SFM to SY of the most exploited species on every concession appears questionable.

No silvicultural treatment (harvesting, thinning, poisoning) was applied to the plot during the period in which measurements were taken. The data set including individual tree information such as tree identity, diameter and position within the plot, was input into the Sustainable Yield Management for Tropical Forests (SYMFOR) model. The model has been calibrated for a Kalimantan PSP data set. Prior to the simulation, the Jambi data set was compared to the Kalimantan data set in terms of diameter class distribution, the dominant tree species, and tree family distribution. It was concluded that both data sets are not significantly different. Moreover, both data sets are lowland tropical primary forest types. Hence, the model was readily applicable to this Jambi data set. Using the SYMFOR computer model several harvesting methods were simulated. These were the conventional method TPTI (Tebang Pilih dan Tanam Indonesia), RIL (Reduced Impact Logging) and a set of harvesting methods derived from the RIL namely RIL8, RIL50 and RIL60. The RIL8 means the maximum number of trees allowable to cut is 8 per hectare, while the RIL50 and RIL60 means the maximum volume of the allowable cut is 50 m3 ha-1 and 60 m3 ha-1 respectively. The RIL60 associated with the production forests category while the RIL50 with the limited production forests category. The simulation was run over a long period of time in order to cover multiple harvest cycles, and were repeated for several times to capture the variability among the runs. These output results were manipulated to obtain the evolution of timber extracted as time went on. Under a 35 year cutting cycle, the RIL50 and RIL60 performed better than other methods - the amount of timber extracted per hectare in the first harvest were successfully attained before the next harvest. The simulation was also conducted by altering the length of cutting cycle within the TPTI, RIL and RIL8. The results showed that timber production increased with the cutting cycle. In particular, under the RIL8 on 45 years cycle, the quantity of timber extracted reached back its pre-first harvest level. This might be due to maximum allowable cut assigned for the RIL8 was less severe. The effect of logging on residual stands was also simulated. It was found that both the RIL50 and RIL60 were consistently better than the other harvesting methods; the forest system could be revived almost to the condition of pre-first harvest level. Upon the cutting cycle extension, it was found that under RIL50 and RIL60 methods, the level of residual stand beyond the 35 years cycle, were successfully returned to its pre-first harvest level. In contrast, both the TPTI and the RIL methods failed to reach its respective pre-first harvest level despite substantial extension of the cutting cycle applied. Notably, the RIL8 which is considered to be less severe logging compared to the RIL, still failed to reach the pre-first harvest level particularly if the cutting cycle less than 45 years. This suggests that in order to reach forest sustainability, careful logging operations as assigned within the RIL methods should be in conjunction with the reduction of logging level. This study consistently suggests that the current forest management guidelines in Indonesia (the TPTI) would not lead our forest sustainably. Both RIL50 and RIL60 harvesting methods on 35 year cycle could be good alternatives for the TPTI.","Conventional TPTI; Extracted timber; Forest sustainability; Maximum allowable cut; Reduced-impact logging (RIL); Residual stand","Sianturi, P.; Department of Mathematics, , Bogor, 16143, Indonesia; email: psianturi@cgiar.org",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053102941

The annual fluxes of NO from undisturbed forest soil in 2001 were 9.0 ± 2.8 ng N cm-2 h-1 for the Oxisol and 8.8 ± 5.0 ng N cm-2 h-1 for the Ultisol. Consumption of CH4 from the atmosphere dominated over production on undisturbed forest soils. Fluxes averaged -0.3 ± 0.2 and -0.1 ± 0.9 mg CH4 m-2 day-1 on the Oxisol and -1.0 ± 0.2 and -0.9 ± 0.3 mg CH4 m-2 day-1 on the Ultisol for years 2000 and 2001. For CO2 in 2001, the annual fluxes averaged 3.6 ± 0.4 μmol m-2 s-1 on the Oxisol and 4.9 ± 1.1 μmol m-2 s-1 on the Ultisol. We measured fluxes over one year each from two recently logged forests on the Oxisol in 2000 and on the Ultisol in 2001. Sampling in logged areas was stratified from greatest to least ground disturbance covering log decks, skid trails, tree-fall gaps, and forest matrix. Areas of strong soil compaction, especially the skid trails and logging decks, were prone to significantly greater emissions of N2O, NO, and especially CH4. In the case of CH4, estimated annual emissions from decks reached extremely high rates of 531 ± 419 and 98 ± 41 mg CH4 m-2 day-1, for Oxisol and Ultisol sites, respectively, comparable to wetland emissions in the region. We calculated excess fluxes from logged areas by subtraction of a background forest matrix or undisturbed forest flux and adjusted these fluxes for the proportional area of ground disturbance. Our calculations suggest that selective logging increases emissions of N2O and NO from 30% to 350% depending upon conditions. While undisturbed forest was a CH4 sink, logged forest tended to emit methane at moderate rates. Soil-atmosphere CO 2 fluxes were only slightly affected by logging. The regional effects of logging cannot be simply extrapolated based upon one site. We studied sites where reduced impact harvest management was used while in typical conventional logging ground damage is twice as great. Even so, our results indicate that for N2O, NO, and CH4, logging disturbance may be as important for regional budgets of these gases as other extensive land-use changes in the Amazon such as the conversion of forest to cattle pasture.","Selective logging; Trace gas; Tropical forest","Keller, M.; CSRC Morse Hall, 39 College Rd., Durham, NH 03824, United States; email: michael.keller@unh.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77249133646

Logging operations vary in timing, location, and intensity. Evidence of this land use is rapidly obscured by forest regeneration and ongoing deforestation. A detailed study of selective logging operations was conducted near Sinop, State of Mato Grosso, Brazil, one of the key Amazonian logging centers. An 11-yr series of annual Lansdat images (1992-2002) was used to detect and track logged forests across the landscape. A semiautomated method was applied and compared to both visual interpretation and field data. Although visual detection provided precise delineation of some logged areas, it missed many areas. The semiautomated technique provided the best estimates of logging extent that are largely independent of potential user bias. Multitemporal analyses allowed the authors to analyze the annual variations in logging and deforestation, as well as the interaction between them. It is shown that, because of both rapid regrowth and deforestation, evidence of logging activities often disappeared within 1-3 yr. During the 1992-2002 interval, a total of 11 449 km2 of forest was selectively logged. Around 17% of these logged forests had been deforested by 2002. An intra-annual analysis was also conducted using four images spread over a single year. Nearly 3% of logged forests were rapidly deforested during the year in which logging occurred, indicating that even annual monitoring will underestimate logging extent. Great care will need to be taken when inferring logging rates from observations greater than a year apart because of the partial detection of previous years of logging activity.","Brazilian Amazon; Forest degradation; Selective logging","Matricardi, E.

Selective logging is one of the most common disturbances ongoing in the Amazon, which results in significant changes in forest structure and canopy integrity. Assessing forest canopy fractional cover (fc) is one way of measuring forest degradation caused by selective logging. In this study we applied a linear mixture model to a vegetation index domain to map canopy fractional cover in tropical forests in the Amazonian state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) was selected as the optimal vegetation index in the model because it is most linearly related to green canopy abundance up to leaf area index=4.0. In the canopy fc map derived from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image, the fc distribution ranged from 0 to 0.4 in clear-cut areas, higher than 0.8 in undisturbed forests, and a wider range of 0.3-1.0 in degraded forests. The fc map was validated with the 1-m panchromatic sharpened IKONOS image.

Some authors proclaim that management should be left to a minimum (Rice et al. 1997), while others argue that sustainable management systems are feasible (Brünig 1996; de Graaf 1986; Johns 1997; Wadsworth 1997). The tropical forests of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo have been marked by well over 100 years of commercial logging of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) and Spanish cedar (Cedrela odorata), as well as major deforestation in earlier centuries by the ancient Mayan civilization (Turner 1978), thus making it a useful laboratory for evaluating the impact of contemporary logging on forest structure and composition. For most of the last hundred years, logging was concentrated in the southern part of the state along the Río Hondo, the border with Belize. From 1953 to 1983, logging spread into the interior of the southern part of the state under the aegis of the parastatal Maderas Industrializados de Quintana Roo (MIQROO), one of the first logging companies in tropical America to operate with a management plan (Flachsenberg and Galletti 1999). Beginning in the early 1960s, small-scale contractors began logging in the central part of the state, the area of particular interest in this study. Finally, beginning in 1985, a good portion of the forests of southern and central Quintana Roo came under the direct management of the communities themselves, supported by the Forestry Pilot Plan (Plan Piloto Forestal; PPF), a joint project of the Mexican federal and state governments and German foreign assistance (Flachsenberg and Galletti 1999). The PPF, in silvicultural terms, was characterized by the establishment of permanent forest areas (PFAs) where management plans were developed and wherein (Figure presented) agriculture was prohibited. The transition from parastatal and private contractor logging to community logging coincided with a dramatic drop in the annual logging volume in the state, as Figure 9.1 indicates. However, the very notable decline and subsequent stability in logging volume in the state in recent years does not mean that the elusive goal of ""sustainability"" has been reached. Most of the communities have continued to operate under management plans adapted from the one used by MIQROO, with particular assumptions about the regeneration and growth rates of mahogany and other species of interest. These assumptions have been vigorously debated (Flachsenberg and Galletti 1999; Negreros-Castillo 1995; Snook 1993, 1996, 1998), as will be further discussed below. In this paper we will present new research on the forest ecology of logging in general and on the impact of logging on mahogany in particular. Specifically we will estimate the number of different tree species in the forest (species richness) and assess the risks for loss of species due to logging. We will then provide an overview of the natural spatial variation and the principal ecological processes that condition the presence of mahogany in the forests of Quintana Roo and the limitations and the possibilities that this presents for more sustainable management. We will also present new data on growth increments of mahogany and other species. We will argue that the premise that mahogany requires large clearings to regenerate (Snook 1993, 1996, 1998) needs to be reexamined in light of research results that show that mahogany can also regenerate in smaller clearings, under certain conditions. Based on the data presented we will make suggestions for modifications in the silvicultural practices in the mahogany forests of Quintana Roo. © 2005 by The University of Texas Press.

In the north of French Guiana both anthropogenic pressures and conflicts between settlements related to the use of natural resources are growing. Based on surveys in 17 forest sites we show that hunting pressure was the main factor determining current primate species richness, masking the effects of logging or forest type. Three of the larger species, the red howler monkey Alouatta seniculus, black spider monkey Ateles paniscus and tufted capuchin Cebus apella, were less abundant in hunted areas. In the areas around four settlements the harvested biomass of primates was low compared to other game species, but the harvests were close to or beyond the maximal sustainable thresholds for the red howler monkey and tufted capuchin. In French Guiana primates are either fully protected by law (the spider monkey and white-faced saki Pithecia pithecia), or their hunting is restricted to subsistence use (howler monkey, tufted capuchin and wedge-capped capuchin Cebus olivaceus). Most hunted meat is, however, destined for sale. Current conservation policy in French Guiana is limited to legal protection for some species and areas, and laws are poorly enforced. Although large areas of forest and its wildlife are protected simply by their remoteness, there is an increasingly urgent need for the legal protection of all primate species, and the establishment of large protected areas and efficient forest management schemes to minimize the impacts of logging and hunting. © 2005 FFI.","Bushmeat; French Guiana; Habitats; Hunting; Neotropical primates; Rainforest; Sustainable harvest","De Thoisy, B.; Association Kwata, BP 672, F-97335 Cayenne Cedex, French Guiana; email: thoisy@kwata.org",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645381276

Bats are model taxa for this purpose. Two different logging systems are used in the natural forest of the Victoria-Mayaro Forest Reserve in Trinidad: open range and periodic block. Open range is a continuous harvesting system and, in common with most methods used to log tropical forests worldwide, has few harvest controls other than girth limits for selected species. Periodic block is a poly cyclic system, with felling based on ecological criteria assumed to be compatible with the maintenance of biodiversity. To compare the effects of periodic block and open-range systems on biodiversity, we determined bat species richness and abundance in each system and in primary forest. We caught bats in mist nets set at ground level and in the canopy and in harp traps. In total 1959 individuals representing 38 species were captured. Species richness was similar among primary forest and logged forest habitats, although bat diversity was lower in logged forest. The distributions of bat species abundance did not differ significantly between logged forest and primary forest. We found, however, that both logging systems lead to a decrease in gleaning animalivores and an increase in frugivores. The increase in frugivores was likely the result of an increase in the abundance of bat-dispersed pioneer fruiting plants in logged forest. Bats of periodic-block-managed forest were more similar to those of primary forest than those of forest logged using the open-range system, indicating that the periodic-block system is more compatible with the maintenance of bat diversity. Our results support the suggestion that the measured use of tropical forests can largely be compatible with biodiversity conservation. ©2005 Society for Conservation Biology.","Biodiversity; Chiroptera; Community ecology; Forest disturbance; Moist tropical forest; Trinidad","Clarke, F.M.; School of Biological Sciences, , Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, United Kingdom; email: f.clarke@abdn.ac.uk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27944491860

Our measurements included a 100% survey of roads and log decks, assessment of canopy damage and ground disturbance in skid trails and tree-fall gaps, and measurement of carbon exported from the site in logs. Log deck and road construction crushed one and five trees in the 10-60 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) class per hectare logged, disturbed areas of 24 and 100 m2 ha-1, respectively, and together disturbed about 1% of the forest. On average 1.1-2.6 trees ha-1 were harvested over the two years. Logged gaps constituted the greatest disturbance on an area basis (4-10% of the forest) and CWD generation (1.9-4.4 Mg ha-1 logged). In gaps, felled trees severed or crushed 10 trees ≥10 cm DBH per tree logged, which corresponded to 1.7 Mg ha-1 of CWD per tree logged. Crown height - measured from the first bifurcation to the top of the crown - rather than tree height was the better predictor of gap size formed from tree felling (R 2 = 0.41). Logging activities significantly reduced leaf area in roads, log decks and gaps, with the greatest reduction (48%) in log decks and least in logged gaps and roads (28-33%) compared to undisturbed forest. A total of 37 species were harvested, with 36% of the total trees harvested and 48% of the total carbon exported from the site in three of the most common species. Logging damage produced 4.9-8.8 Mg C ha-1 logged of CWD from all phases of the operation. Carbon export in whole logs (2.1-3.7 Mg C ha -1 logged) represented 1-3% of the total standing forest carbon ≥10 cm DBH (138 Mg C ha-1). The mean carbon ratio (per hectare logged) of C in CWD to C exported in logs was 2.4. The disturbance, damage, carbon export and CWD data we present advances understanding of the effect of selective logging on tropical forest dynamics of the Amazon Basin. Our results indicate that certified timber harvest in Amazonia under RIL is a viable forest management option to reduce damage and CWD production compared to conventional logging (CL) practices; however, the benefits of disturbance reduction from RIL relative to CL are only realized at greater volumes of timber extraction. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The NDFI synthesizes information from several component fraction images derived from spectral mixture models. Interpretation of the NDFI data is facilitated by a contextual classification algorithm (CCA) that enables accurate mapping of logging and fire-derived canopy damages. The CCA utilizes detected log landings, which are the spatial signature of selective logging, as starting locations for searching the NDFI image for canopy damage. This process separates canopy changes due to logging and associated forest fires from those caused by other natural disturbances. These methods were tested in the Sinop region, in the Southern Brazilian Amazon. Forest transect inventories, conducted along a gradient of degraded forests, were used to evaluated the performance of the NDFI. The NDFI was more sensitive to canopy damage than any individual fraction and is shown to have the potential for further sub-classification of degradation levels in forest environments. Map accuracy of forest canopy damage using the CCA classifier, assessed with aerial videography images, was 94%. The proposed NDFI-CCA classifier approach can be fully automated and, therefore, holds great promise as a forest monitoring tool in tropical forests. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Although most logging gaps were dominated by a few pioneer species, the commercial species A. ruizii, H. crepitans, P. nemorosa, and Terminalia oblonga may eventually dominate many gaps. Notably absent among gap regeneration were some of the most commercially valuable tree species, such as Swietenia macrophylla, Cedrela fissilis, Cariniana ianeirensis, and Ficus boliviana.

Long-term logging and habitat destruction have resulted in population decline and distribution retreat of Q. tiaoloshanica. To determine the impact of logging on the genetic diversity of Q. tiaoloshanica, the authors investigated the genetic structures using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in four regenerated stands after logging and in one unlogged stand. Compared with the unlogged stand, the effective number of alleles per locus dropped by 1.0% in selective logging stands and by 2.0% in clear logging stands, corresponding to reductions of 3.8% and 5.2%, respectively, in mean Nei's gene diversity and 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively, in mean Shannon diversity index. No substantial genetic erosion was detected in any of the regenerated stands owing to the high tree density and high heterogeneity of the Q. tiaoloshanica stands investigated. Meanwhile, there was no natural regeneration of the species observed in a Dacrydium pierrei Hickel plantation 700 m away from the regenerated stands, suggesting the limited ability of seed dispersal of Q. tiaoloshanica. Clear logging should be undertaken cautiously because the total number of plant species dropped by 15.2% in the clear-logged stands compared with the unlogged stand. To conserve the genetic diversity of this species, as well as the plant biodiversity of tropical forests, the habitats of Q. tiaoloshanica should be protected against exploitation in terms of agricultural or other forms of land use, and some mature trees should be preserved as seed sources to maintain an adequate regeneration base for this species in the management of logging.","Amplified fragment length polymorphism; Genetic erosion; Logging; Quercus tiaoloshanica; Tropical forest","An, S.-Q.; Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Global Changes, , Nanjing 210093, China; email: anshq@nju.edu.cn",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31444447448

Specifically, we address the road-building processes of loggers who are very active in the Amazon landscape. To this end, we develop an explanation of road expansions, using a positive approach combining a theoretical model of economic behavior with geographic information systems (GIS) software in order to mimic the spatial decisions of road builders. We simulate two types of road extensions commonly found in the Amazon basin in a region showing the fishbone pattern of fragmentation. Although our simulation results are only partially successful, they call attention to the role of multiple agents in the landscape, the importance of legal and institutional constraints on economic behavior, and the power of GIS as a research tool. © 2005 by Association of American Geographers Initial submission, February 2004;.","Amazonia; Land-use change; Least-cost path","Arima, E.Y.; Department of Geography, , East Lansing, MI 48824, United States; email: arimaeug@msu.edu",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27844491042

There is also little consensus on the most appropriate methods for sampling tropical species, making it difficult to draw general conclusions from published studies. For example, many studies have used butterflies to assess impacts of selective logging but sampling has usually been conducted at ground level and the canopy fauna has often been ignored. In this study, we investigate the importance of sampling in the canopy by using fruit-baited traps to investigate impacts of selective logging on Nymphalid butterflies in primary forest and forest selectively logged 15 years previously in Sabah (Malaysian Borneo). Analysing combined data from canopy (≈25 m above ground level) and ground-level traps showed significantly lower diversity in selectively logged forest. However, this difference was not observed when data from only ground traps were analysed. Primary forest supported a butterfly assemblage comprising species with more restricted geographical ranges, and thus higher conservation value, compared with selectively logged forest. This result was observed regardless of whether or not canopy data were included in this analysis. We conclude that sampling in the canopy is critical when producing species inventories, but of little importance when determining the impacts of selective logging on restricted-range species. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, methods that can be applied to study population structure and growth of trees in natural forests are developed upon. The study is based on data collected over a period of 8 years from permanent sample plots covering a total of 18.6 ha in three flood plain forest types at the lower Río Ucayali. The population structure of the eight species varied considerably with maximum diameters at breast height ranging from 31 to 140 cm. For M. coriacea stem densities and basal areas were as high as 159 ha -1 and 3.4 m2/ha, respectively, but for most other species, stem densities and basal areas were much lower. Seedling densities of the eight species ranged from 1 to 42,002 ha-1 with a mortality of 27-100% per year and for some species a significant relationship was found between mortality and duration of the flooding period. Diameter increments were analyzed using a simple diameter class approach as well as a more sophisticated single-tree growth model, for which a variety of competition indices were screened. Based on the statistical performance and practicability of the indices it appeared that the most successful measure of competition was the local basal area of trees with diameters exceeding that of the individual in question. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The impact of habitat disturbance on biodiversity conservation and animal health is poorly understood. Selective logging results in a suite of alterations that may increase infection risk and susceptibility to infection in resident populations. 2. The aim of this study was to improve our understanding of this interplay by examining the effects of logging on infection risk and gastrointestinal parasite infections in three primate species whose populations have responded differently to selective logging in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Populations of redtail guenons Cercopithecus ascanius are declining in logged forest; red colobus Piliocolobus tephrosceles populations are in a state of slow recovery; and black-and-white colobus Colobus guereza populations are increasing in logged forest. 3. We collected faecal samples from these three primate species over a period of 5 years in logged and undisturbed forest, to compare parasite infection prevalence and the magnitude of multiple infections. We also analysed canopy and ground vegetation plots to compare environmental contamination with primate parasites in logged and undisturbed forest. 4. The prevalence and richness of gastrointestinal helminth and protozoan parasite infections, and the magnitude of multiple infections were greater for redtail guenons in logged than undisturbed forest, but these parameters did not differ between forest types for either colobine. Data from the canopy and ground vegetation plots revealed that infective stages of two representative generalist primate parasites occurred at higher densities in logged compared with undisturbed forest, signifying a greater infection risk for all primate species in logged forest. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that selective logging can be associated with changes in an important ecological association between hosts and parasites. Our results indicate that anthropogenic habitat change could influence patterns of parasite infection in primates with associated effects on population performance. © 2005 British Ecological Society.","Cercopithecus; Colobus; Disturbance ecology; Selective logging; Tropical forest","Gillespie, T.R.; Program in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, 2001 South Lincoln Avenue, Urbana, IL 61802, United States; email: trg@uiuc.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28244435705

Here, I estimate epiphyte species richness and biomass on 35 oak host trees, equally divided over several trunk diameter classes, in each of 16 sites in anthropogenic disturbed montane pine-oak forests at similar elevations. The sites vary in their amount of disturbance from scarcely to heavily disturbed, related to the structure of the forest, and in their underlying distance in the landscape with a maximum of ca. 25 km. The explainable variation in the epiphyte vegetation is partitioned between environmental and spatial variables, using multivariate data analysis. In total, 74 species of epiphytes were encountered. Bromeliads dominate at all sites in terms of their biomass. Forest disturbance, measured as the proportion of sprouted oaks, has an expected negative effect on the epiphyte biomass and alpha diversity per ground surface area, but also on the epiphytes on the remaining and re-grown trees. This pattern was sustained after corrections for differences in host-tree size were made. Nevertheless, the epiphytes show resilience to disturbance if forests are selectively logged to spare big trees. Such remnant trees are essential for epiphytes that require the presence of accumulated suspended soil and they may also serve as nearby epiphyte seed sources for the re-growing trees. Anthropogenic disturbances also force a shift from mesic to more drought tolerant species. Hence, disturbance exerts an influence on the regional distribution of epiphytes, but a similar amount of variation (20-30%, depending on the used spatial descriptors) could entirely be attributed to the geographic position of the sites, independent from the influence of environmental variables. Nearby sites are more similar in epiphytes than distant sites (Mantel's r = 0.44, P = 0.002) and I postulate that this relates to differences in seed supply, viewing the development of the epiphyte community from a dispersal assembly perspective. For epiphyte conservation purposes, it is recommended to adopt a management of selective logging instead of cyclic clear-cutting and to spare large trees during logging. In addition, it is wise to try to attain a homogeneous distribution of epiphyte protective reserves within a uniform physiographic region. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Small size of logging gaps, lack of soil disturbance, and limited seed availability have each been blamed for observed regeneration failures. We investigated seed germination and seedling performance using a split-plot factorial design involving light availability and litter removal for six Central African timber tree species, hypothesizing that canopy gaps and litter removal would improve seedling establishment, and that less shade-tolerant species would show stronger responses to both factors. Contrary to our expectations, significantly more germinants established on intact litter than on exposed mineral soil 3 mo after seeding. After 18 mo, seedling survival, height and diameter growth, leaf area, and rooting depth were all much higher in gap plots than in the understory for all species, with the exception of Gilbertiodendron dewevrei, a highly shade-tolerant species whose survival was higher in the understory. Leaf production was negatively influenced by litter removal in the least shade-tolerant species, Nauclea diderrichii, with weak or positive effects in other species. G. dewevrei, while displaying a low-light threshold for growth, exhibited a surprisingly high growth response to increasing light comparable to more shade-intolerant species, a response that may help explain its local competitive dominance in the region. Due to the rapid closure of small gaps, we suggest that shade-intolerant species such as N. diderrichii, Khaya anthotheca, and Entandrophragma utile might benefit from more intensive silvicultural practices that create larger canopy gaps.","Central Africa; Light gaps; Litter removal; Seedling establishment and growth; Timber species; Tropical moist forest","Thomas, S.C.; University of Toronto, 33 Willcocks Street, Toronto, Ont.

They range in size from more than 1.7 million km2 (Guiana) to 199,211 km2 (Belém). Forest loss in each ranges from 2% to 13% of their area, except for Xingu (nearly 27% lost) and Belém, (now only about one-third of its forest remains).

Home range size of radio-tagged bristlebills was 10-20% larger (depending on data sample used) in unlogged forest compared with logged forest, but the difference was not significant. Movement rates during 1-h observation periods were highest in unlogged forest. The bristlebill has been characterized as a bird of dense understorey vegetation, and data from unlogged forest in the present study suggested that areas with dense understorey were used more often than expected. In logged forest, no habitat preferences were found, probably because the forest had a dense understorey throughout. Assuming that smaller home ranges and lower movement rates indicate better habitat, there was no evidence that bristlebills were negatively affected by logging. The preference for dense understorey in unlogged forest suggests that the bristlebill may benefit from selective logging because this leads to an increase in dense understorey. © 2005 African Journal of Ecology.","Habitat use; Logging; Pycnonotidae; Tropical forest","Dale, S.; Department of Ecology and Natural Resource Management, PO Box 5003, NO-1432 Ås, Norway; email: svein.dale@umb.no",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20444454319

Matrix models of forest dynamics allow time-projection of diameter-class distributions and thus assessment of the time needed, after logging, to recover a given part of the exploitable stock. They are easy to build and they only require, as input variables, the diameter structure of the population(s) under scope. However, such models are based on a coarse description of tree population dynamics and must be used with caution. In particular, as trees are only described from a diameter threshold (usually 10 cm dbh), recruitment of a new tree cannot be linked with the preceding generation since too much time elapsed between seed dispersal and the installation of a 10-cm recruit. This causes predictions of matrix models to be highly questionable in the long term when ingrowth to larger dbh classes greatly depends on the way recruitment has been modelled. We used a case study from French Guiana to test whether or not a simple matrix model is reliable enough to help forest managers choose between management alternatives. We focused on the major timber species Dicorynia guianensis Amshoff (Caesalpiniaceae) harvested under a selective cutting regime. We compared predictions of D. guianensis stock recovery in the short and long term provided by two models: StoMat, a non-regulated matrix model, and SELVA, a single-tree distance dependent model explicitly simulating the entire species life cycle. Both models were independently calibrated on data from Paracou permanent sample plots. We showed that: (i) the short-term recovery of the exploitable stock predicted by StoMat is reliable for a large range of disturbance conditions; (ii) recruitment implementation in StoMat does not influence projections until the third felling cycle; (iii) for shared initial stand conditions SELVA and StoMat give consistent mid- and long-term predictions: the simple recruitment model used into StoMat could efficiently summarise the regeneration processes of the species under low felling intensity. Our results indicate that the current felling regime used in French Guiana may not be sustainable on a long-term basis. In any case, no more than 60% of the initial stock would be recovered after logging. We conclude that simple models can provide as reliable predictions as more complicated ones. They may be sufficient to assess the recovery of a species' exploitable stock even in the long term, or at least assess the (un)sustainability of particular harvesting regimes. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Studies of the breeding birds in the core part of the forest (Białowieża National Park) over 29 years show that the bird community is species-rich but that densities of individual species are usually low, resulting in only moderate overall densities. In some species, low densities are a consequence of large territories and social exclusion, but more often they reflect the undersaturation of habitats by birds, despite superabundant food supply and nest-sites. Low productivity, resulting from high nest predation, may contribute to undersaturation. Species composition and numbers of birds fluctuate within relatively narrow limits, with the populations of closely related species fluctuating either independently of one another or in parallel; interspecific competition for resources plays a minor role. Some attributes of the Białowieża ecosystems resemble conditions in undisturbed tropical forests but contrast sharply with those in fragmented, temperate secondary forests. The present Białowieża avifauna provides a glimpse of that existing in central European forests before their historical transformation by humans. Its present exceptional character arises from preservation of most of its pristine features. The forest constitutes a critical reference point for studies of woodland ecology, and its preservation should be a high priority. Unfortunately, commercial logging continues, gradually changing the forest's structure and affecting the birds, especially those dependent on dead wood and old-growth. The relatively small national park (47.5 km2) is increasingly becoming an 'island', in which the long-term preservation of primeval forest features will be impossible. © British Birds 98.",,"Tomiałojć, L.; Natural History of Museum, Sienkiewicza 21, 50-335 Wrocław, Poland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844433616

There is considerable debate about whether tropical forests can be managed for timber production and to conserve biodiversity. Few 'sustainable forestry' systems have been evaluated adequately in this respect. Microchiropteran bats may be model taxa for this purpose. They are an important component of mammalian diversity, play key roles in forest dynamics and are indicators of disturbance in neotropical forests. 2. We investigated the effect of Trinidad's periodic block system (PBS) on bat species diversity and community organization. PBS is a polycyclic system of selective logging with a 30-year harvesting rotation. We captured bats in primary forest and PBS-managed forest logged 33, 31, 21, 20 and 10 years previously. 3. Selective logging did not affect species diversity but did affect community structure. Frugivorous bats were significantly more abundant in logged forest whereas gleaning animalivores were more abundant in primary forest, suggesting that frugivores benefited and gleaning animalivores were adversely affected by logging. 4. The bat community showed evidence of recovery. The number of years since forest disturbance was positively correlated with the abundance and number of species of gleaning animalivores and negatively correlated with the proportional abundance of the most common species. Gleaning animalivores increased in abundance with forest regeneration, whereas the community became less dominated by a single generalist frugivore. 5. Synthesis and applications. PBS selective logging appears to be compatible with the conservation of bat diversity. This provides evidence that neotropical forests can be managed for timber production in an ecologically sustainable way and that significant biodiversity conservation efforts can occur outside national parks and nature reserves in areas set aside for sustainable development. PBS could serve as a basic blueprint for sustainable forestry in the Guianan Shield where there are forests similar in species composition to those of Trinidad. Key attributes that could be adopted by many tropical countries to manage their forests in an ecologically sustainable way are a low intensity harvest, a long rotation and multiple controls on harvesting. © 2005 British Ecological Society.","Biodiversity conservation; Chiroptera; Forest disturbance; Trinidad","Clarke, F.M.; School of Biological Sciences, , Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, United Kingdom; email: f.clarke@abdn.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-18444404063

This paper examines avifaunal implications (focusing on species diversity and composition) of forest fragmentation and selective logging, by comparing 15 selected reserved forests in south-west Ghana. The regeneration time since last logging varied from 0 (logging continuing) to 21 years, with one unlogged site as control. Extraction levels ranged between 0.20, and 3.75 trees per ha (mean 0.90). Bird sampling involved understorey mist-netting and standardized line-transect walks, which respectively accumulated 8,348 captures and 22,452 single records Of 147 species. Mist-net data showed that understorey bird diversity was positively correlated with logging intensity up to c. 3 trees per ha, reflecting increased influx of open-land species and a persistence of forest obligates during the first 5 years after logging. The overall abundance of forest interior species tended to decrease 5-10 years after logging, but recovered fairly well thereafter. Canopy birds were generally more logging-resilient. Rare forest obligates with high conservation importance were found to be equally abundant in virgin and logged, large forests, whereas these birds were poorly represented in small heavily logged forests. The results are compared with findings from other regions, and conservation implications and constraints are discussed in a global perspective.

Two recent programmes (FAO 2000 Forest Resources Assessment and TREES II), exploiting the global imaging capabilities of Earth observing satellites, have recently been completed to provide information on the dynamics of tropical forest cover. The results from these independent studies show a high degree of conformity and provide a good understanding of trends at the pan-tropical level. In 1990 there were some 1150 million ha of tropical rain forest with the area of the humid tropics deforested annually estimated at 5.8 million ha (approximately twice the size of Belgium). A further 2.3 million ha of humid forest is apparently degraded annually through fragmentation, logging and/or fires. In the sub-humid and dry tropics, annual deforestation of tropical moist deciduous and tropical dry forests comes to 2.2 and 0.7 million ha, respectively. Southeast Asia is the region where forests are under the highest pressure with an annual change rate of -0.8 to -0.9%. The annual area deforested in Latin America is large, but the relative rate (-0.4 to -0.5%) is lower, owing to the vast area covered by the remaining Amazonian forests. The humid forests of Africa are being converted at a similar rate to those of Latin America (-0.4 to -0.5% per year). During this period, secondary forests have also been established, through re-growth on abandoned land and forest plantations, but with different ecological, biophysical and economic characteristics compared with primary forests. These trends are significant in all regions, but the extent of new forest cover has proven difficult to establish. These results, as well as the lack of more detailed knowledge, clearly demonstrate the need to improve sound scientific evidence to support policy. The two projects provide useful guidance for future monitoring efforts in the context of multilateral environmental agreements and of international aid, trade and development partnerships. Methodologically, the use of high-resolution remote sensing in representative samples has been shown to be cost-effective. Close collaboration between tropical institutions and inter-governmental organizations proved to be a fruitful arrangement in the different projects. To properly assist decision-making, monitoring and assessments should primarily be addressed at the national level, which also corresponds to the ratification level of the multilateral environmental agreements.

During each of six successive years, we measured tree diameters and counted woody fruit capsule segments that fell below the crowns of 82 mahogany trees in natural forest in central Quintana Roo, Mexico. Sample trees ranged from &lt;20 cm to more than 100 cm DBH. Fruit production increased with diameter, and trees ≥75 cm produced significantly more fruits each year than did trees of smaller diameters. Large trees could produce more than 700 fruits/year. Trees ≥75 cm DBH were also more consistent producers: while up to 27% of trees &lt;75 cm DBH produced &lt;1 fruit/year in any year, at least 93% of larger trees produced fruit every year. Over the 6 years, individual trees ≥75 cm produced a total of 367 ± 34 fruits, as compared to 91 ± 8 fruits among trees &lt;75 cm (an average of 61 ± 7 and 15 ± 2 fruits/year, respectively). However, the number of fruit produced per unit crown volume was not significantly different between the two size categories. Fruit production varied among years, with the highest production in 1998 and the lowest in 1999 and 2000. The population of sampled mahogany trees produced approximately three times more fruit, and individual trees produced up to five times more fruit, in the year of highest production, as compared to the lowest. Mahogany does not exhibit the fruit production patterns found in mast fruiting species. Inter-annual variability in size of fruit crops at both the population and individual-tree levels are lower than in masting species, and the synchronocity among trees was low. Basal area growth averaged 76.5 ± 18.6 cm 2/year for trees ≥75 cm and 29.9 ± 1.7 cm 2/year for trees &lt;75 cm DBH, and varied significantly among years. Years of high fruit production were also years of good growth, implying ""resource matching"" rather than the ""resource switching"" associated with masting. To ensure seed production for the regeneration of mahogany it is important to retain mahogany trees ≥75 cm DBH as seed sources. This presents a challenge, since currently mahogany trees in this region are harvested down to a minimum diameter as low as 55 cm. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Selective harvesting within ‘natural forests’ (i.e. those forests that have not been clearfelled for non-forest uses or converted to plantation or agroforestry) covers a very wide range of practices, including highlead and tractor yarding, harvesting of only large, commercial trees, protection of riparian vegetation along rivers and protection of forest on very steep hills. As a consequence, the intensities of the impacts on the water environment (i.e. water, nutrient and sediment systems) are expected to be very varied. Some of these impacts can be profound. One of the most significant environmental impacts of all types of forestry operations within the humid tropics is accelerated soil erosion (Bruijnzeel, 1992). The resultant input of sediments into rivers leads to damage to fish populations (Martin-Smith, 1998), reduced quality of water supplies, reductions in channel capacity which affects flood risk and boat traffic (Sheffield et al., 1995), and the inundation of offshore corals (MacDonald et al., 2001). Development of selective harvesting techniques when applied to natural forests in the tropics are currently being focused on so-called ‘Reduced-Impact-Logging’ (RIL) or ‘closely supervised’ methods which aim to improve the ‘sustainability’ of timber production and reduce wider environmental damage. © UNESCO 2005 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928860928

However, there is also a long history of research and management experience that indicates that, provided forest managers and planners respect broad land capability limits, appropriately managed logging operations can be compatible with the maintenance of hydrological values and high quality water supplies (Gilmour, 1977a, b; Poels, 1987; Baharuddin, 1988; Abdul Rahim, 1990; Bruijnzeel, 1992).

Research now being undertaken on the implementation of RIL techniques (e.g. Barreto et al., 1998; Hammond et al., 2000; Pinard et al., 2002) is clarifying many of the key issues associated with the continuation of inadequate management practices in commercial timber harvesting. © UNESCO 2005 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928856457

The treatment of tropical forest dwellers by development organisations has been mixed. Government and international agencies have tended to view forest peoples as, at best, an archaic legacy of a pre-industrial era who have little or nothing to contribute to development and environmental policy. At worst, such populations are perceived as a downright obstacle to progress, or even a threat to national sovereignty, that need to be dragged, screaming if necessary, into the ‘modern’ age. Throughout history, indigenous and other traditional groups have seen their forest resource base come under attack as geographical frontiers have been pushed back in the name of national integration and economic development. The strategies adopted have included highway construction, cattle ranching, small farmer settlement, export crop production, commercial logging and hydropower expansion. Nations such as Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia, amongst others, have all pursued aggressive strategies of tropical forest occupation in which the needs of the native peoples themselves have been routinely ignored. Until relatively recently, the social and environmental consequences of such policies were rarely given a second thought by planners and policy-makers. It is no exaggeration to say that forest peoples were (and to a large degree still are) considered expendable in the march towards modernisation and nationhood. Perhaps the clearest indicator of such pressures is deforestation. It is calculated that by 1988 the world had already lost 40% of its tropical forests (Park, 1992). © UNESCO 2005 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,"Hall, A.L.; LCSES, The World Bank, 1818 N Street, United States",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928856057

Logging operations vary in timing, location, and intensity. Evidence of this land use is rapidly obscured by forest regeneration and ongoing deforestation. A detailed study of selective logging operations was conducted near Sinop, State of Mato Grosso, Brazil, one of the key Amazonian logging centers. An 11-yr series of annual Lansdat images (1992-2002) was used to detect and track logged forests across the landscape. A semiautomated method was applied and compared to both visual interpretation and field data. Although visual detection provided precise delineation of some logged areas, it missed many areas. The semiautomated technique provided the best estimates of logging extent that are largely independent of potential user bias. Multitemporal analyses allowed the authors to analyze the annual variations in logging and deforestation, as well as the interaction between them. It is shown that, because of both rapid regrowth and deforestation, evidence of logging activities often disappeared within 1-3 yr. During the 1992-2002 interval, a total of 11 449 km2 of forest was selectively logged. Around 17% of these logged forests had been deforested by 2002. An intra-annual analysis was also conducted using four images spread over a single year. Nearly 3% of logged forests were rapidly deforested during the year in which logging occurred, indicating that even annual monitoring will underestimate logging extent. Great care will need to be taken when inferring logging rates from observations greater than a year apart because of the partial detection of previous years of logging activity.","Brazilian Amazon; Forest degradation; Selective logging","Matricardi, E.

In undisturbed forest, annual soil-atmosphere fluxes of N2O (mean ± standard error) were 7.9 ± 0.7 and 7.0 ± 0.6 ng N cm -2 h-1 for the Oxisol and 1.7 ± 0.1 and 1.6 ± 0.3 ng N cm-2 h-1 for the Ultisol for 2000 and 2001, respectively. The annual fluxes of NO from undisturbed forest soil in 2001 were 9.0 ± 2.8 ng N cm-2 h-1 for the Oxisol and 8.8 ± 5.0 ng N cm-2 h-1 for the Ultisol. Consumption of CH4 from the atmosphere dominated over production on undisturbed forest soils. Fluxes averaged -0.3 ± 0.2 and -0.1 ± 0.9 mg CH4 m-2 day-1 on the Oxisol and -1.0 ± 0.2 and -0.9 ± 0.3 mg CH4 m-2 day -1 on the Ultisol for years 2000 and 2001. For CO2 in 2001, the annual fluxes averaged 3.6 ± 0.4 μmol m-2 s -1 on the Oxisol and 4.9 ± 1.1 μmol m-2 s -1 on the Ultisol. We measured fluxes over one year each from two recently logged forests on the Oxisol in 2000 and on the Ultisol in 2001. Sampling in logged areas was stratified from greatest to least ground disturbance covering log decks, skid trails, tree-fall gaps, and forest matrix. Areas of strong soil compaction, especially the skid trails and logging decks, were prone to significantly greater emissions of N2O, NO, and especially CH4. In the case of CH4, estimated annual emissions from decks reached extremely high rates of 531 ± 419 and 98 ± 41 mg CH4 m-2 day-1, for Oxisol and Ultisol sites, respectively, comparable to wetland emissions in the region. We calculated excess fluxes from logged areas by subtraction of a background forest matrix or undisturbed forest flux and adjusted these fluxes for the proportional area of ground disturbance. Our calculations suggest that selective logging increases emissions of N2O and NO from 30% to 350% depending upon conditions. While undisturbed forest was a CH4 sink, logged forest tended to emit methane at moderate rates. Soil-atmosphere CO2 fluxes were only slightly affected by logging. The regional effects of logging cannot be simply extrapolated based upon one site. We studied sites where reduced impact harvest management was used while in typical conventional logging ground damage is twice as great. Even so, our results indicate that for N 2O, NO, and CH4, logging disturbance may be as important for regional budgets of these gases as other extensive land-use changes in the Amazon such as the conversion of forest to cattle pasture.","Selective logging; Trace gas; Tropical forest","Keller, M.; CSRC Morse Hall, 39 College Rd., Durham, NH 03824, United States; email: michael.keller@unh.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955962533

Selective logging is one of the most common disturbances ongoing in the Amazon, which results in significant changes in forest structure and canopy integrity. Assessing forest canopy fractional cover (fc) is one way of measuring forest degradation caused by selective logging. In this study we applied a linear mixture model to a vegetation index domain to map canopy fractional cover in tropical forests in the Amazonian state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) was selected as the optimal vegetation index in the model because it is most linearly related to green canopy abundance up to leaf area index = 4.0. In the canopy fc map derived from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image, the fc distribution ranged from 0 to 0.4 in clear-cut areas, higher than 0.8 in undisturbed forests, and a wider range of 0.3-1.0 in degraded forests. The fc map was validated with the 1-m panchromatic sharpened IKONOS image. In the logged forests the ETM+ estimated fc values were clustered along the 1:1 line in the scatterplot with the IKONOS estimated fc and had a squared correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.8.","Forest degradation; Remote sensing; Selective logging","Wang, C.; Stewart Hall, Cuizhen Wang, 8, Columbia, MO 65211, United States; email: wangcu@missouri.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955937578

Expecting seasonally deciduous forests that require intensive silviculture to secure sustained yields of commercial species to be especially fire prone, I assessed fire susceptibility in a Bolivian semi-deciduous forest subjected to four management intensities: no logging control; selective harvest only; and two harvest treatments with additional silviculture. I quantified treatment effects on fuel loads, vegetative cover, dry-down rates of 10-h fuels, and fire spread in 4-m2 test plots. With these data and daily rainfall records, I estimated the number of fire-prone days per month associated with each treatment. Fuel loads increased with management intensity, but principally in the 1000-h size class. Treatment impacts on vegetative cover were modest, in part because only 30% of the control forest comprised mature stands with closed canopies &gt;16 m high. Fuels dried enough to ignite in 3-5 days in sites with sparse cover, but within 11 days in sites with dense cover. Given that rainless periods of 20 days are common throughout the dry season, fuels are dry enough to burn for long periods in this forest. In the late dry season in forest logged 2-4 months previously, total cover had little effect on whether test plots burned. Plots in recently logged forest burned more readily than those in forest logged one and three years previously. The model developed for calculating fire-prone days indicated that, unlike intact evergreen Amazon forests that typically remain fire resistant, this forest is very fire prone during most dry seasons. The similar number of fire-prone days among treatments suggests that forest managers need not worry about elevating fire susceptibility with their silviculture. These results suggest that timber management and fire susceptibility trade-offs are modest in this forest because it is already fire prone and because the intensity of silvicultural treatments applied was low compared to other tropical production forests. Fire severity, however, would likely increase with management intensity due to increases in 1000-h fuels. Fire prevention efforts must complement silviculture treatments to achieve sustained yields if these and similar forests are to serve both production and conservation goals. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.","Amazon; Bolivia; Deciduous; Fire susceptibility; Logging impacts; Timber; Trade-offs; Tropical forest management","Blate, G.M.; Department of Botany, P.O.

Within the Brazilian Amazon, cattle ranching and swidden agriculture provide abundant sources of ignition to forests that become susceptible to fire through selective logging, severe drought and, perhaps, fragmentation. Our understanding of the biophysical factors that control fire spread through Amazon forests remains largely anecdotal, however, restricting our ability to model the Amazon fire regime, and to simulate the effects of trends in climate and land-use activities on future regimes. We used experimental fires together with measurements of micrometeorology (rainfall, vapor pressure deficit [VPD], wind velocity), canopy attributes (leaf area index [LAI], canopy height), and fuel characteristics (litter moisture content [LMC] and mass) to identify the variables most closely associated with fire susceptibility in the east-central Amazon. Fire spread rates (FSR, m/min) were measured in three common forest types: an 8-yr-old regrowth forest, a recently logged/burned forest, and a mature forest. One hundred fires were set in each study area during the last two months of the 2002 dry season. VPD, recent precipitation history, wind velocity, and LAI explained 57% of the variability in FSR. In combination, LAI, canopy height, and recent precipitation history accounted for ∼65% of the variability in VPD, the single most important predictor of FSR, and approximately half of the total observed variability in FSR. Using logistic regression we were able to predict whether a fire would spread or die 72% of the time based on LAI, canopy height, and recent precipitation history. An approximate threshold in fire susceptibility was associated with a LMC of ∼23%, somewhat higher than previously reported (15%). Fire susceptibility was highest under low, sparse canopies, which permitted greater coupling of relatively hot, dry air above the canopy with the otherwise cool, moist air near the forest floor. Fire susceptibility increased over time after rain events as the forest floor gradually dried. The most important determinants of fire susceptibility can be captured in ecosystem and climate models and through remotely sensed estimates of canopy structure, canopy water content, and microclimatic variables. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.","Amazon; Canopy structure; Drought; Experimental fire; Rain forest fire","Nepstad, D.; Woods Hole Research Center, P.O.

Frequently, estimates of community-level attributes are biased because the estimators make assumptions of the data that are violated; many published studies assume equal detectability across species, sites, or time. The accuracy of estimators of species richness and community-level vital rates (e.g., extinction and colonization) can be increased by using probabilistic estimation methods, which do not assume that all species are detected, or that the data assume a particular statistical distribution. Using these estimation methods, we examined avian community dynamics in a fragmented tropical landscape using data from five years of a mark-release-recapture study. For the resident understory avifauna in each of five small (∼0.3-20 ha), isolated forest fragments in southern Costa Rica, we estimated species richness, rate of change in species richness, extinction and turnover rates of species, and the number of colonizing species over temporal scales of one month, one year, and two years. We expected that community dynamics would be higher in smaller fragments than in larger fragments, reflecting greater temporal variability of avian communities in relatively small habitat patches. Additionally, a selective logging operation was conducted at one of our sites during the midpoint of this study, which gave us the opportunity to examine how community-level vital rates may reflect the effects of that perturbation. Our results demonstrate that avian communities in the larger fragments were more stable than those in the smaller fragments, and that the selectively logged fragment was the most unstable of all. We found that extinction rates were more similar across our sites than were colonization rates, and that the higher instability of the small fragments was due primarily to higher levels of colonization. Although our sample size (n = 5) precludes strong inference, our findings are consistent with the prediction of higher local dynamics within small fragments and after logging. Taken together, these findings suggest that smaller fragments are more dynamic over time, and that ecological processes and multitrophic relationships at these dynamic sites may be in a constant state of flux. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.","Colonization; Community dynamics; Costa Rica; Extinction rate; Forest bird communities; Fragmentation; Logging; Mark-release-recapture; Patch size; Species richness; Tropical forest; Turnover rate","Borgella Jr., R.; Department of Biology, , Ithaca, NY 14853, United States; email: rborgella@ithaca.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20444366231

One key concern is the impact of forestry practices on hydrological processes, particularly the effect of forest harvest on water quality and quantity. Since the mid 1980s, a series of scientific studies on forest hydrology have been initiated in major types of forest across the country, including Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis), Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata), oak (Quercus mongolica), larch (Larix gmelinii), faber fir (Abies fabri), Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis), armand pine (Pinus arandi), birch (Betula platyphylla) and some tropical forests. These studies measured rainfall interception, streamflow, evapotranspiration and impacts of forest management (clearcutting and reforestation). This paper reviews key findings from these forest hydrological studies conducted over the past 20 years in China. Forest canopy interception rates varied from 15 to 30% of total rainfall, depending on forest canopy and rainfall characteristics. Stemflow is generally a small percentage (<5%) of total rainfall, but it accounts for 15% in the oak forest in northeast China. The high amounts of stemflow, as well as higher amounts of nutrients contained in stemflow, ay allow oak trees to adapt to a dry and nutrient-poor environment. Evapotranspiration was a significant component of the water budget in these Chinese forests studied, ranging from 80-90% of total rainfall in the northern temperate forests to 40-50% in the southern tropical forests. Forests substantially reduced surface runoff and erosion. However, no consistent response on total streamflows was observed. The reason for the inconsistency may be due to complexities of streamflow processes and the utilization of different methodologies applied at the various spatial scales.

Genetic variation is affected by selective logging directly, through the removal of and damage to trees within the population, and indirectly, through a change in the forest structure and environment in which the remaining population lives. Eco-Gene is a population genetics model applied to tropical forests over a scale of hundreds of hectares. SYMFOR is a modelling framework for individual-based spatially explicit ecological and management models applied to tropical forests over a scale of 0.25 4 ha. We have linked the models to enable simulations using processes involved in both models. To overcome problems of scale, the spatially explicit competition index calculated in SYMFOR simulations has been modelled such that it can be applied at scales representing much larger areas for which the data are not available, as required by Eco-Gene. The competition index is modelled as a distribution on a grid-square basis, and implemented in the linked Eco-Gene/SYMFOR system. Each tree within a grid-square is given a ""relative competition"" within the distribution, biased according to species. A competition index value is obtained for the tree by transforming the grid-square distribution to be relevant to the size of the tree, and extracting a value according to the tree's relative competition within the distribution. The distribution and each tree's relative competition within it change according to the effects of growth, mortality and logging activity. The model was calibrated using data from the Tapajós region of the Eastern Amazon forest. This paper describes the model, its calibration and validation and the implications of scaling up from an explicit representation to a modelled quantity. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This was achieved by comparing aerial photographs with data obtained previously from destructive sampling in the same area. Aerial photographs were taken above the primary and logged forest plots in 1997. The heights of the canopy-forming trees were estimated in both plots by means of aerial triangulation and were regressed against the diameter at breast height (DBH) of the corresponding trees measured during ground surveys. The resulting allometric relationship between tree height and DBH let us estimate TAGB: in the primary forest, TAGB was 310 Mg ha -1, which was ca. 10-12% smaller than the value estimated by means of destructive sampling conducted in the 1970s. The estimated TAGB of the logged forest was 274 Mg ha -1, which was significantly smaller than that of the primary forest (P &lt; 0.05). We also measured canopy surface height in a 2.5 m grid system. We found that the mean canopy surface height (MCH) in every 20 m × 20 m subplot (0.04 ha) was significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) correlated with TAGB for that subplot. This suggests that the spatial variation of TAGB can be estimated using MCH values obtained from such a grid system, and that biomass levels can potentially be estimated by means of satellite remote sensing on larger scales, even for very dense tropical forests. We also found that digital reflectance values from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images differed significantly between the logged and primary forests, and hypothesize that these differences relate to structural differences in the canopy surface. However, TAGB in both plots was poorly correlated with the Landsat reflectance values, suggesting the necessity of using an active remote-sensing sensor or a laser profiling system that can quantify changes in the forest's vertical structure or volume to estimate biomass and its variation in dense evergreen forests. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Demographic data on number of trees, species and diameter of all trees above 1 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were measured from three ecological plots (20 m × 50 m) established at different elevations in each study site. The total reduction in mean basal area for trees ≥1 cm dbh for both logged stands was significantly different (P < 0.05), i.e. 50.9% in Compartment 118 and 51.8% in Compartment 48. All trees more than 60 cm dbh in Compartment 118 and 75 cm dbh in Compartment 48 were felled in a single selective cutting under selective management system (SMS). The removal of these genetically superior adult trees will affect the genetic quality of the remaining and subsequent regenerating gene pools. The mean basal area and tree density for seedling and sapling class (<5 cm dbh) were reduced to one-half of the original stand in Compartment 118 after logging, meanwhile an increment of 24.3% was observed in Compartment 48, 2.5 years after logging. This implies that the logging operation favoured the growth of seedlings and saplings. The net loss in trees was offset by incremental growth in surviving trees. Good regeneration was observed in the regenerated stand of Compartment 69 (RS-C69) with 28.5% and 20.5% more, respectively, in basal area and tree density for seedling and sapling class compared to Compartment 118 before logging. There were no distinct changes in species composition before and after logging in this study. The high negative correlation of basal area with relative disturbance index was observed in Compartments 118 and 48 based on botanical name or native name, indicating that the degree of disturbance was affected by the type and magnitude of disturbances in each of the localities in the compartment. This further implies that a logging operation in the compartment is not a homogeneous activity. The current harvesting system (i.e. SMS) in Peninsular Malaysia should consider the abundance of young regenerants and the genetic quality of the residuals left behind in the post-harvest stands. The current mechanized logging techniques also need to be improved by adopting the reduced impact logging (RIL) techniques, so as to promote regeneration of desired commercial timber species and as a consequence, sustainability of the forests. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Reduction in basal area of trees from different size classes due to a single logging event ranged from -100 - 100% in S. curtisii, D. aromatica and S. macropodum with large trees &gt;45 cm dbh generally being absent. Recruitment of seedlings and presence of saplings was generally high for the non-dipterocarp species, S. macropodum (100% increase) but low for the dipterocarp species, D. aromatica (45% decrease) and S. curtisii (53% decrease) in immediately logged-over forests. Damage to poles was high in S. curtisii (92% and 88% for basal area and tree density respectively), D. aromatica (33% and 57%) and S. macropodum (73% and 73%). These changes in population structure of some tree species can persist in regenerated forests even after 50 years of logging. No significant change in genetic diversity was observed for adults of S. macropodum and saplings of D. aromatica and S. curtisii immediately after logging. However, genetic diversity of seedlings and adults of S. curtisii was reduced by 34% and 85% respectively for hypothetical gametic diversity, Vgam and 30% and 85% respectively for latent genetic potential, LP immediately after logging. Substantial genetic erosion was also detected for adults of S. curtisii (71% reduction in V gam and 63% reduction in LP) and S. macropodum (31.5% reduction in Shannon diversity, H) in regenerated stands which were logged 50 years ago.

Corruption and illegal logging undermine economic and social development by weakening the rule of law and state institutions. The environmental, social and economic impacts are enormous; for example, the World Bank (2002) estimates that illegal logging costs governments worldwide at least US$10 billion per year just in lost revenue. Supply-side approaches to forest governance, such as strengthe ning law enforcement, are seldom effective without corresponding actions on the demand side. Among the potential demand-side instruments are trade policies established by producing countries or their trade partners. Recently there has been great interest in the potential of trade liberalization - i.e. a reduction in costs and barriers to the free movement of goods and services - to improve forest governance. Theoretically, it should increase the price to the exporter and reduce the price to the importer, and so encourage more trade. Trade can be liberalized through reduced import or export tariffs, removal of formal trade barriers such as log export bans, or limiting of other non-tariff measures such as phytosanitary regulations, quotas and product quality standards.",,"",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17444394874

The model is based on analyses of extensive field studies carried out on permanent forest inventory plots, and syntheses of published studies. New analyses included: (1) growth suppression of small trees, (2) maximum size (trunk base diameter) for 220 tree species, (3) the relationship between growth rate and wood density, and (4) the growth response of surviving trees to catastrophic mortality (from logging). The model simulates a forest inventory plot, and tracks recruitment, growth, and mortality of live trees, decomposition of dead trees (coarse litter), and how these processes vary with changing environmental conditions. Model predictions were tested against aggregated field data, and also compared with independent measurements including maximum tree age and coarse litter standing stocks. Spatial analyses demonstrated that a plot size of ∼10 ha was required to accurately measure wood (live and dead) carbon balance. With the model accurately predicting relevant pools and fluxes, a number of model experiments were performed to predict forest carbon balance response to perturbations including: (1) increased productivity due to CO 2 fertilization, (2) a single semi-catastrophic (10%) mortality event, (3) increased recruitment and mortality (turnover) rates, and (4) the combined effects of increased turnover, increased tree growth rates, and decreased mean wood density of new recruits. Results demonstrated that carbon accumulation over the past few decades observed on tropical forest inventory plots (∼0.5 Mg C ha-1 year-1) is not likely caused by CO2 fertilization. A maximum 25% increase in woody tissue productivity with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 only resulted in an accumulation rate of 0.05 Mg C ha-1 year-1 for the period 1980-2020 for a Central Amazon forest, or an order of magnitude less than observed on the inventory plots. In contrast, model parameterization based on extensive data from a logging experiment demonstrated a rapid increase in tree growth following disturbance, which could be misinterpreted as carbon sequestration if changes in coarse litter stocks were not considered. Combined results demonstrated that predictions of changes in forest carbon balance during the twenty-first century are highly dependent on assumptions of tree response to various perturbations, and underscores the importance of a close coupling of model and field investigations. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Carbon cycling model; Coarse woody debris; Decomposition; Growth; Net ecosystem exchange; Productivity","Chambers, J.Q.; Tulane University, , New Orleans, LA 70118, United States; email: chambers@tulane.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642289921

The debate on illegal forest activities has focused primarily on legal and governance issues. Economic forces, however, are increasingly recognized as fundamental drivers of illegal forest activities. We ask the question whether the legalization of small logging concessions and their development can teach us anything about how to address the illegal logging problem. We find that legalization alone-when a legal timber concession is granted to a previously illegal operator-does not necessarily result in a significant reduction in illegal activities. When illegal activities are profitable, they can be expected to continue. Changing the regulatory framework to increase monitoring and enforcement can affect the profitability of these illegal activities. By changing the underlying economic incentives for logging, such interventions hold greater promise of success. In the medium to long term, however, legalization may help reduce illegal logging when it entrusts local people with ownership and control of forest resources and maintains a monitoring role for government agencies. © 2004 by The Haworth Press.

Seedlings planted in clearings grew more than in either forest or A. pubescens sites. Very few established trees were found in A. pubescens sites, and most of these were near the forest edges.

Timber harvesting results in more than 5 million ha of tropical forest annually being transformed into degraded, poorly managed, logged-over forests. The reduction and degradation caused by anthropological activities affect not only the sustainable production of timber but also the global environment. Accurate scientific information will enable managers to devise silvicultural systems to enhance soil properties and forest resources important for sustainable production and to minimize deleterious impacts of harvesting and short-rotation plantations. Ultimately, rehabilitation can increase the area of forest as well as conserve remaining primary forests and environmental quality. Rehabilitation aims to improve biological diversity, increase commercial value of timber and non-timber products, increase forest functions and improve soil fertility. Technical advances will reduce logging impacts, accelerate natural regeneration and improve species selection, enrichment, sustainable site management, catalytic planting and site evaluation and classification. Socio-economic reform should focus on local community participation and acceptance. The CIFOR/Japan project has undertaken research in many countries to evaluate impacts of harvesting and fires on forest ecosystems and to develop methods to rehabilitate logged-over forests and degraded forestlands in ways that are biologically successful as well as socio-economically acceptable. In Indonesia, CIFOR collaborates with Universitas Mulawarman at the Bukit Soeharto Education Forest, a mixed dipterocarp forest logged by INHUTANI I in 1976. The approach to rehabilitation has been through the ""taungya"" system whereby farmers grow annual crops among newly planted trees. With the Instituto Nacional de Investigacion Agraria (INIA), Peru, the project is trialling revegetation of fallow fields abandoned after agricultural use in the Ucayali region of the Peruvian Amazon. There is specific interest in selecting tree species with high economic value that grow rapidly in abandoned agricultural land and on infertile soils. Early results point to promising species. The project also involves small farmers in silvicultural activities and species selection. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Degraded tropical forest ecosystems; Dipterocarp forest; Global environment; Landscape rehabilitation; Sustainable forest management","Kobayashi, S.; Forest. and Forest Prod.

We performed a 2-year study on germination, survival and growth of four timber species, Cedrela odorata, Swietenia macrophylla, Hymenaea courbaril, and Cariniana micrantha, and one non-commercial species Tachigali vasquezii. We sowed seeds of these species in five microenvironments: log landing, gap-crown and gap-trunk, skidder trail and understory, in a tropical lowland moist rain forest in northern Bolivia. We related seed and seedling performance to light availability, soil compaction, and plant competition. Germination did not differ significantly between microenvironments but survival of germinated seeds for most species was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in the log landing (46-100%) than in the understory (0-7%). After 2 years, the tallest plants were always found in the log landing (119-190 cm) and the smallest in the understory (12-26 cm) caused by a higher relative height growth rate (RHGR) in the log landing (0.003-0.004 cm cm -1 per day) compared to the understory (0.000-0.001 cm cm -1 per day). During the first year RHGR was positively related to canopy openness for all species and negatively to the number of overtopping competitors for three species. During the second year also water infiltration explained observed variation to RHGR. These results show that abandoned log landings and logging gaps are suitable environments for the regeneration of timber species studied. This finding suggests that the removal of competitors in log landings and logging gaps combined with leaving seed trees near these microenvironments or sowing seeds, will improve regeneration of timber species in tropical forests. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This requires critical evaluation. In this 10-year study, we quantify tree community dynamics in three selectively logged areas harvested at different intensities and compare their recovery to two unlogged areas in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Over the 10 years, 527 of the original 4840 tagged trees (≥10 cm DBH) died; while the mortality rate was highest in the heavily logged area, it was only significantly greater than one of the unlogged sites. The density of new trees varied significantly among areas being highest in the lightly logged area, but the density of new recruits in the heavily logged area did not differ from the unlogged areas. Overall, the more heavily logged areas had higher growth rates than the unlogged or lightly logged areas. However, there was no difference among areas in the magnitude of the change in basal area; and in both 1990 (20+ years post-harvest) and 2000 the basal area in the heavily logged area was significantly less than the unlogged areas. In general, findings from the heavily logged area suggest that the expectation that in logged areas a number of processes of forest regeneration will be accelerated relative to unlogged forest was not met. Thus, 30+ years after logging evidence suggests that forest recovery will be slower than expected. We also present evidence to suggest that the climate in the region is changing, which may account for changes in the population dynamics of certain species in the unlogged forests.","Climate change; Demography; Forestry; Logging; Management; Population dynamics","Department of Zoology, United States; email: cchapman@zoo.ufl.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444304468

Neither abundance nor diversity of amphibians generally were significantly affected by low-level selective logging, although the abundance of individual species differed. Mantelline anurans were the most sensitive, in contrast to the tree frogs of the subfamily Boophinae (Mantellidae) and Cophylinae (Microhylidae). The abundance of Mantellinae anurans decreased by 15.8% after logging, whereas Boophinae and Microhylidae anurans increased by 12.1% and 3.7%, respectively. In general, species strongly tied to rainforest habitat showed a non-significant 10.1% decrease in abundance after logging. It appears therefore that amphibians are relatively resilient to a low-level of forest exploitation and their diversity is apparently not affected, at least in the short-term.

All trees ≥15 cm d.b.h. were censused along transects covering 4.95 ha at Buyangu and 4.15 ha at Isecheno. The structure of the forest at the two sites was similar as mean d.b.h. was comparable and stem size class distribution did not differ significantly. However, species richness and stem density were both much higher at Buyangu. The disparity in stem density may be because of the greater abundance at Isecheno of a semi-woody undergrowth species, Brillantaisia nitens Lindau, believed to inhibit the establishment of tree seedlings. Floristic composition varied strikingly between sites, with 52% of the species occurring only at one site. Densities of those species present at both sites often differed markedly between sites. Potential sources of these intersite differences in floristic composition include small disparities in rainfall, soil composition, elevation, and temperature as well as past differences in anthropogenic disturbance and in large mammal distribution and abundance. Floristic differences between Buyangu and Isecheno appear to be at least partly responsible for the substantial dietary differences between redtail monkeys (Cercopithecus ascanius Audebert) at these sites.","Brillantaisia nitens; Cercopithecus ascanius; Disturbance; Kakamega Forest; Logging; Tropical forest","Fashing, P.J.; Department of Anthropology, 1200 Amsterdam Ave., New York, NY 10027, United States; email: peterf@zoo.pgh.pa.us",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9644262802

In order to help bring more balance and clarity to such debate, this paper reviews a wide range of available scientific evidence with respect to the influence exerted by the presence or absence of a good forest cover on regional climate (rainfall), total and seasonal water yield (floods, low flows), as well as on different forms of erosion and catchment sediment yield under humid tropical conditions in general and in southeast Asia in particular. It is concluded that effects of forest disturbance and conversion on rainfall will be smaller than the average decrease of 8% predicted for a complete conversion to grassland in southeast Asia because the radiative properties of secondary regrowth quickly resemble those of the original forest again. In addition, under the prevailing 'maritime' climatic conditions, effects of land-cover change on climate can be expected to be less pronounced than those of changes in sea-surface temperatures. Total annual water yield is seen to increase with the percentage of forest biomass removed, with maximum gains in water yield upon total clearing. Actual amounts differ between sites and years due to differences in rainfall and degree of surface disturbance. As long as surface disturbance remains limited, the bulk of the annual increase in water yield occurs as baseflow (low flows), but often rainfall infiltration opportunities are reduced to the extent that groundwater reserves are replenished insufficiently during the rainy season, with strong declines in dry season flows as a result. Although reforestation and soil conservation measures are capable of reducing the enhanced peak flows and stormflows associated with soil degradation, no well-documented case exists where this has also produced a corresponding increase in low flows. To some extent this will reflect the higher water use of the newly planted trees but it cannot be ruled out that soil water storage opportunities may have declined too much as a result of soil erosion during the post-clearing phase for remediation to have a net positive effect. A good plant cover is generally capable of preventing surface erosion and, in the case of a well-developed tree cover, shallow landsliding as well, but more deep-seated (>3 m) slides are determined rather by geological and climatic factors. A survey of over 60 catchment sediment yield studies from southeast Asia demonstrates the very considerable effects of such common forest disturbances as selective logging and clearing for agriculture or plantations, and, above all, urbanisation, mining and road construction. The 'low flow problem' is identified as the single most important 'watershed' issue requiring further research, along with the evaluation of the time lag between upland soil conservation measures and any resulting changes in sediment yield at increasingly large distances downstream. It is recommended to conduct such future work within the context of the traditional paired catchment approach, complemented with process-based measuring and modelling techniques. Finally, more attention should be paid to the underlying geological controls of catchment hydrological behaviour when analysing the effect of land use change on (low) flows or sediment production. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

What macroeconomic linkages and policies are decisive? A comparison of research findings on long-run land-use changes in eight tropical developing economies reveals that the direct physical impacts of the oil industry on forests are unquestionably less than its derived macroeconomic impact. In most cases oil wealth indirectly but significantly protects tropical forests. The core mechanism is that oil rents cause macroeconomic ""Dutch disease"" decreasing the price competitiveness of agriculture and logging, strongly diminishing pressures for forest degradation and deforestation. But domestic policy responses to oil wealth are also vital determinants of the forest outcome. When governments use oil wealth for urban spending sprees, this reinforces the core effect by pulling more labor out of land-using and forest-degrading activities. When oil revenues finance road construction or frontier colonization, however, the core forest-protective effect can be reversed. Repeated currency devaluation and import protection of land-using domestic sectors also increase pressures on forests. Other international capital transfers, like bilateral credits, aid, or debt relief, can have impacts similar to those of oil wealth, either alleviating pressures on forests or aggravating specific forest-detrimental policies. These insights point to forest-friendly safeguards that can realistically be made in the design of structural adjustment programs, considering the important tradeoffs between development and conservation objectives. © The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/THE WORLD BANK 2004; all rights reserved.",,"Wunder, S.; CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia; email: s.wunder@cgiar.org",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644233422

With logging and mining seen as increasing threats to the region, it is necessary to look at methods for engaging stakeholders in monitoring the status of their natural resources. This paper presents the results of a pilot study carried out to investigate water use by the Makushi Amerindians, and collect baseline data on the hydro-morphological aspects of the waterways. Methods included informal interviews, the use of the River Habitat Survey (RHS), and water quality measurements. The results indicate the heavy reliance of the Makushi on the waterways for their daily lives, particularly on fishing. Although ponds and creeks are important sources of fish, the rivers provide much larger catches of a greater diversity of fish species, both in the wet and dry seasons. The physical characteristics of the water sources used by the Makushi are mainly associated with the surrounding habitat types: The savanna areas containing the more nutrient rich white-water rivers, and the tropical forest areas containing the less nutrient rich black-water rivers. This study indicates that at present there is no direct evidence of adverse impacts on the waterways used by the Makushi in terms of fish catches, habitat conditions and water quality. A monitoring scheme was set up using this study's outputs as a baseline from which any future changes can be compared. Further work is to be carried out over the next three years to produce monitoring and sustainable management procedures for the North Rupununi ecosystems, by linking the physical attributes of the environment to biodiversity and subsequently local livelihoods, and by building capacity of local stakeholders through training. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Our field studies encompassed measurements of ground damage and canopy gap fractions along multitemporal sequences of post-harvest regrowth of 0.5-3.5 yr. Areas used to stage harvested logs prior to transport, called log decks, had the largest forest gap fractions, but their contribution to the landscape-level gap dynamics was minor. Tree falls were spatially the most extensive form of canopy damage following selective logging, but the canopy gap fractions resulting from them were small. Reduced-impact logging resulted in consistently less damage to the forest canopy than did conventional logging practices. This was true at the level of individual landscape strata such as roads, skids, and tree falls as well as at the area-integrated scale. A spectral mixture model was employed that utilizes bundles of field and image spectral reflectance measurements with Monte Carlo analysis to estimate high spatial resolution (subpixel) cover of forest canopies, exposed nonphotosynthetic vegetation, and soils in the Landsat imagery. The method proved highly useful for quantifying forest canopy cover fraction in log decks, roads, skids, tree fall, and intact forest areas, and it tracked canopy damage up to 3.5 yr post-harvest. Forest canopy cover fractions derived from the satellite observations were highly and inversely correlated with field-based canopy gap fraction. Subsequent regional-scale estimates of forest gap fraction were derived from the combination of field- and satellite-based measurements. A 450-km2 study of gap fraction showed that approximately one-half of the canopy opening caused by logging is closed within one year of regrowth following timber harvests. This is the first regional-scale study utilizing field measurements, satellite observations, and models to quantify forest canopy damage and recovery following selective logging in the Amazon.","Amazon basin; Brazil; Canopy damage; Gap fraction; Land-use change; Landsat 7; Selective logging; Spectral mixture analysis; Timber harvest; Tropical forest","Asner, G.P.; Department of Global Ecology, 260 Panama Street, Stanford, CA 94305, United States; email: gpa@stanford.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444302054

There is an urgent need to understand the impacts of anthropogenic habitat disturbance on biodiversity in tropical forests, but no consensus has yet emerged. We reviewed the literature for the most frequently studied taxon (birds, 37 studies) and found that increased and decreased diversity in response to disturbance (selective logging and shifting agriculture) were reported with approximately equal frequency. 2. The spatial scale at which studies were carried out significantly affected the reported response to disturbance: studies where disturbed and undisturbed habitats were sampled at large spatial scales were more likely to report increased diversity following disturbance, whereas studies that sampled habitats at small spatial scales were more likely to report decreased diversity. These results were not a consequence of sampling method: we divided the studies into those using capture methods and those using observation methods and the same result was obtained when the analysis was restricted to only those studies using observation methods. 3. Previously, we have shown that reported impacts of disturbance on Lepidoptera are also affected by the spatial scale of study. We reviewed the Lepidoptera literature published since then and showed that all 12 new studies conformed to the predicted pattern. 4. While sampling scale significantly affected the reported responses of both birds and Lepidoptera, there were opposite effects of scale in the two taxa: large-scale bird studies and small-scale Lepidoptera studies were more likely to report increased diversity following disturbance. Bird studies were generally carried out at larger spatial scales than those of Lepidoptera and these opposite impacts of scale were probably due to a non-linear effect of habitat disturbance on habitat heterogeneity at different spatial scales. 5. Synthesis and applications. The rapid loss and degradation of tropical forests means that an understanding of the general patterns of responses of species to habitat disturbance is urgently needed. However, there has been little discussion of the most appropriate methods to ensure comparability of results between studies. Data presented here indicate that the spatial scale of sampling chosen in studies has a marked effect on the results obtained, and future studies need to account for this by examining explicitly the effects of disturbance at different spatial scales. The effect of spatial scale differs between taxa, and this may explain why the search for indicator taxa of disturbance effects has so far proved elusive.","Biodiversity; Birds; Lepidoptera; Rainforest; Selective logging","Hill, J.K.; Department of Biology (Area 3), PO Box 373, York YO10 5YW, United Kingdom; email: jkh6@york.ac.uk",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843067583

Ecological studies in LBA focus on how tropical forest conversion, regrowth, and selective logging influence carbon storage, nutrient dynamics, trace gas fluxes, and the prospect for sustainable land use in the Amazon region. Early results from ecological studies within LBA emphasize the variability within the vast Amazon region and the profound effects that land-use and land-cover changes are having on that landscape. The predominant land cover of the Amazon region is evergreen forest; nonetheless, LBA studies have observed strong seasonal patterns in gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem exchange, as well as phenology and tree growth. The seasonal patterns vary spatially and interannually and evidence suggests that these patterns are driven not only by variations in weather but also by innate biological rhythms of the forest species. Rapid rates of deforestation have marked the forests of the Amazon region over the past three decades. Evidence from ground-based surveys and remote sensing show that substantial areas of forest are being degraded by logging activities and through the collapse of forest edges. Because forest edges and logged forests are susceptible to fire, positive feedback cycles of forest degradation may be initiated by land-use-change events. LBA studies indicate that cleared lands in the Amazon, once released from cultivation or pasture usage, regenerate biomass rapidly. However, the pace of biomass accumulation is dependent upon past land use and the depletion of nutrients by unsustainable land-management practices. The challenge for ongoing research within LBA is to integrate the recognition of diverse patterns and processes into general models for prediction of regional ecosystem function.","Amazon; Carbon; Cerrado; Land-use and land-cover change; LBA; Nutrients; Oxisol; Savanna; Trace gases; Tropical forest; Ultisol","Keller, M.; University of New Hampshire, , Durham, NH 03824, United States; email: michael.keller@unh.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642550480

The rarefaction method, the lognormal species-abundance relationship, and the nonparametric jackknife method were used to compare species richness between the habitats. The data were also fitted to log series, truncated lognormal, geometric, and broken-stick species abundance models to detect changes in community structure. The community composition of Passalidae in Los Tuxtlas did not differ ostensibly between the primary and secondary forests. Neither the mean number of individuals nor the biomass per log differed significantly. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the two habitats in terms of the number of underbark, sapwood/heartwood, and microhabitat generalist species. Different richness estimators indicated that the primary forest community is only slightly richer. The slight decrease in richness of the secondary forest is related to a decrease in dominance by certain species, as well as to a more balanced abundance distribution, which is adequately described by the broken-stick model. Complementary explanations for this pattern may be: (1) that logging reduces the abundance of dominant species, thus preventing competitive exclusion in the secondary forest; and (2) that passalid diversity is not regulated by the diversity of tree species.","Coleoptera; Community structure; Passalidae; Rotting logs; Species diversity; Tropical forest disturbance","Lobo, J.M.; Dept.

This association occurs because forest resources are, at least during a certain period, the main income source for local human populations. It is now possible to establish how these threats act in concert causing tree species impoverishment.

We established chronosequences of large-area (14-158ha) selective logging sites spanning a 3.5-year period of forest regeneration and two distinct harvest methods: conventional logging (CL) and reduced-impact logging (RIL). Our goals were to: (1) determine the spatial characteristics of canopy gap fraction immediately following selective logging in the eastern Amazon; (2) determine the degree and rate of canopy closure in early years following harvest among the major landscape features associated with logging - tree falls, roads, skid trails and log decks; and (3) quantify spatial and temporal differences in canopy opening and closure in high- and low-damage harvests (CL vs. RIL). Across a wide range of harvest intensities (2.6-6.4 felled trees ha-1), the majority of ground damage occurred as skid trails (4-12%), whereas log decks and roads were only a small contributor to the total ground damage (&lt;2%). Despite similar timber harvest intensities, CL resulted in more ground damage than RIL. Neither the number of log decks nor their individual or total area was correlated with the number of trees removed or intensity of tree harvesting (trees ha-1). The area of skids was well correlated with the ground area damaged (m2) per tree felled. In recently logged forest (0.5 years postharvest), gap fractions were highest in log decks (mean RIL = 0.83, CL = 0.99) and lowest in tree-fall areas (RIL: 0.26, CL: 0.41). However, the small surface area of log decks made their contribution to the total area-integrated forest gap fraction minor. In contrast, tree falls accounted for more than two-thirds of the area disturbed, but the canopy gaps associated with felled trees were much smaller than for log decks, roads and skids. Canopy openings decreased in size with distance from each felled tree crown. At 0.5 years postharvest, the area initially affected by the felling of each tree was approximately 100 m in radius for CL and 50 m for RIL. Initial decreases in gap fraction during the first 1.5 years of regrowth diminished in subsequent years. Throughout the 3.5-year period of forest recovery, tree-fall gap fractions remained higher in CL than in RIL treatments, but canopy gap closure rates were higher in CL than in RIL areas. During the observed recovery period, the canopy gap area affected by harvesting decreased in radius around each felled tree from 100 to 40m in CL, and from 50 to 10 m in RIL. The results suggest that the full spatial and temporal dynamics of canopy gap fraction must be understood and monitored to predict the effects of selective logging on regional energy balance and climate regimes, biogeochemical processes including carbon cycling, and plant and faunal population dynamics. This paper also shows that remote sensing of log decks alone will not provide an accurate assessment of total forest area impacted by selective logging, nor will it be closely correlated to damage levels and canopy gap closure rates. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Amason basin; Brazil; Canopy damage; Carbon cycle; Forest recovery; Gap fraction; Selective logging; Tropical forest","Asner, G.P.; Department of Global Ecology, , Stanford, CA 94305, United States; email: gpa@stanford.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642538554

We measured the volume and density of fallen CWD at two sites, Cauaxi and Tapajós in the Eastern Amazon. At both sites we studied undisturbed forests (UFs) and logged forests 1 year after harvest. Conventional logging (CL) and reduced impact logging (RIL) were used for management on areas where the geometric volumes of logs harvested was about 25-30 m3 ha-1. Density for five classes of fallen CWD for large material (&gt; 10 cm diameter) ranged from 0.71 to 0.28 Mg m-3 depending upon the degree of decomposition. Density of wood within large fallen logs varied with position relative to the ground and with distance from the center of the log. Densities for materials with diameters from 2 to 5 and 5 to 10 cm were 0.36 and 0.45 Mg m-3, respectively. The average mass (± SE) of fallen CWD at Cauaxi was 55.2 (4.7), 74.7 (0.6), and 107.8 (10.5) Mg ha-1 for duplicate UE, RIL, and CL sites, respectively. At Tapajós, the average mass of fallen CWD was 50.7 (1.1) Mg ha-1 for UF and 76.2 (10.2) Mg ha-1 for RIL for duplicate sites compared with 282Mgha-1 for live aboveground biomass. Small- and medium-sized material (&lt;10cm dia.) accounted for 8-18% of the total fallen CVM mass. The large amount of fallen CWD at these UF sites relative to standing aboveground biomass suggests either that the forests have recently been subjected to a pulse of high mortality or that they normally suffer a high mortality rate in the range of 0.03 per year. Accounting for background CWD in UF, CL management produced 2.7 times as much CWD as RIL management. Excess CWD at logging sites would generate a substantial CO2 emission given the high rates of decay in moist tropical forests. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Amazon; Coarse woody debris; Reduced impact logging; Selective logging; Tropical forest; Wood density","Keller, M.; Complex Systems Research Center, , Durham, NH 03824, United States; email: michael.keller@unh.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642527922

It is implemented within the SYMFOR (http://www.symfor.org) framework. It is based on measurements of all trees that have a diameter greater than 5cm from experimental plots in the Jarí Cellulose and Tapajós National Forest areas over a 16-year period. Ten species groups are used to describe the natural processes affecting tree behaviour. Growth rates are calculated for each species group using the tree diameter and a competition index. Mortality and recruitment are simulated as stochastic processes. Recruitment probability is based on the predicted growth rate of a hypothetical tree. Options exist to vary the human interaction with the forest reflecting forest management decisions, as for other SYMFOR models. Model evaluation compares the performance of the model with data describing forest recovery for 16 years following logging. The model was applied to simulate current forest management practice in the Brazilian Amazon, with 40m3ha-1 of timber extracted with a cutting cycle of 30 years. Results show that yields are sustained for three harvests following the first logging of primary forest, but that the composition of timber moves towards lightwooded species rather than hardwooded. The predicted size of extracted trees decreases and the number of trees extracted increases with successive harvests, leading to a prediction of increased costs and lower profits for the logging company despite constant yields. The standing volume of all trees just before harvest is reduced by 15% over 150 years, with pioneer species becoming increasingly prevalent in the stand. The model, in the SYMFOR framework, can be used to help understand the differences between alternative forest management strategies in the Brazilian Amazon.

We examined changes in tree population structure and composition over an 18-year period (1981-1999) in three plots located at the center of the Isecheno study site in the Kakamega Forest, Kenya, a forest with a history of logging and other anthropogenic disturbance. DBH size class distribution took the shape of an 'inverse J' curve in both 1981 and 1999 and did not differ significantly between the two study periods. Stem density increased significantly during the study with most of the increase occurring in the smallest stem size class (10-14 cm DBH). Nearly all of the most common species in 1981 remained among the most common in 1999, though the density of pioneer species decreased by 21% during the study. Our results suggest that forest in the study plots remained relatively undisturbed and in good condition over the study period. Forest in the plots also appeared still to be recovering from the selective logging of large trees that took place at Isecheno in the 1940s. In addition to our longitudinal study, we compared tree population parameters at three additional Isecheno sites spread over a distance of ∼ 1 km that have experienced different histories of disturbance: (i) a lightly human disturbed site (LHD), (ii) a heavily human disturbed site (HHD), and (iii) a cattle disturbed site (CD). While all three sites were selectively logged in the 1940s, the main signs of disturbance today are footpaths at the LHD site, tree stumps at the HHD site, and wide cattle paths at the CD site. Not surprisingly, of the disturbed sites, the LHD site was in the best condition. Trees at the HHD site exhibited extremely poor recruitment into the small size classes, a condition that can probably be attributed to human exploitation of small trees for poles. The CD site appeared to be at an earlier successional stage than the other disturbed sites with its low mean DBH, high overall stem density, and high pioneer species stem density. Browsing and trampling of vegetation by cattle may be the source of the light gaps that have led to the abundance of pioneer species at this site. We conclude that conservation measures applied to central Isecheno, including the establishment of a forest station nearby and ranger patrols, appear to have succeeded, but that the prognosis for the Kakamega Forest in general is bleak if protection efforts are not increased in other parts of the forest, where anthropogenic disturbance remains high. We also note the considerable variation in tree population structure and composition that can occur within a small area depending on the local history of disturbance.","Cattle; Conservation; Human disturbance; Selective logging; Tropical forest","Fashing, P.J.; Dept.

To determine the area from which lianas colonize tree crowns in a liana-rich moist lowland forest in a timber concession in the Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, we described ""liana sheds"" of individual canopy trees (the area under the crown and beyond its margins from which lianas colonize trees). In the same area we tested the hypothesis that pre-logging cutting of lianas in a harvested tree's liana shed reduces post-logging liana infestations. Prior to logging, 73% of 570 trees >10 cm in DBH representing 12 commercial species, carried at least one liana >2 cm DBH. Liana-infested trees hosted an average of 9.3 lianas (±0.45 S.E., range: 1-68). The mean area of the crown covered by lianas was 35% (±29.7 S.E.) but some trees (10%) were completely covered by lianas. ""Liana shed areas"" were a function of crown area and varied among tree species. Most lianas on trees were rooted below the crown of their host (90%); the number of lianas decreased with increasing distance from the crown edge, but lianas colonized trees from as far as 8 m beyond the crown. Overall, there was a significant reduction in the number of lianas in 22 felling gaps 8 months after logging where lianas were cut before logging compared with 22 control gaps. In control gaps, the majority of climbing lianas sprouted from the prostrate stems of fallen canopy lianas (81%), including 3.1 km/ha of stems that were rooted along the ground before logging. Liana regeneration in gaps after pre-logging liana cutting occurred mainly by stump sprouting (41%) and sprouting from prostrate stems (48%). Pre-felling liana cutting reduced liana cover in felling gaps by 9% only but reduced liana basal area by 69%. The results of this study suggest that tree crown area, shape, and height are among the most important factors determining the likelihood of liana colonization of canopy trees and that pre-logging liana cutting reduces post-logging liana proliferation in logging gaps. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Lianas are particularly abundant in disturbed areas of the forest, such as logging gaps, and pre-harvest liana cutting has been widely recommended throughout the tropics to reduce the impact of lianas during and following tree harvest. The effectiveness of forest-wide liana cutting, however, is currently unresolved, particularly for reducing liana abundance in logging gaps. Furthermore, our understanding of the dynamics and rate of liana colonization in gaps is limited. We tested: (1) the speed at which lianas recruit into logging gaps and their dynamics afterwards; and (2) whether pre-harvest liana cutting actually reduces the abundance of lianas in post-harvest logging gaps. To test hypothesis 1, we compared liana recruitment in new, 1 and 6-year-old logging gaps. For hypothesis 2, we compared liana abundance and tree infestation by lianas in 1-year-old logging gaps in which all lianas had been cut 9 months prior to tree felling vs. 1-year old logging gaps in which lianas were not cut. Lianas recruited heavily into logging gaps within 1 year, mostly by means of stem sprouts, and many of these new stems were apparently able to persist for longer than 6 years. Lianas were significantly more abundant in the root/bole zone of gaps than in the canopy zone, mostly due to the vigorous regeneration of stem sprouts. Canopy openness was highest in gaps one year after logging, possibly due to the smothering effect of the lianas on developing trees. Although liana abundance increased significantly over the 6-year gap chronosequence, direct liana infestation of trees remained the same. Pre-logging liana cutting, however, significantly reduced the number of lianas and also the number of liana-infested trees in logging gaps. Consequently, liana cutting appears to be an effective method to reduce the abundance of lianas and thus minimize their detrimental effects on regenerating trees in logging gaps. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

While this mechanism would compensate for missing markets in forest environmental services, it could also enable industrialized countries to avoid reducing energy use. This paper assesses whether such projects could contribute to improved logging practices in the tropics. Results from studies primarily in Asia and Latin America are analyzed in the context of the modalities of the Kyoto Protocol. Results show that the opportunity cost of shifting from conventional logging to improved practices may have been underestimated. At the same time the long-term carbon and biodiversity benefits of improved forest management may have been underestimated. These results follow primarily from the fact that most previous studies assume that a permanent forest estate is maintained under conventional logging and that cutting cycles are as long as 30-60 years. A more realistic scenario, however, consists of repeated harvesting at short intervals during the first few decades, resulting in the degradation of the forest into shrub and grassland. The implications of these results are that forest management projects may be less cost-effective than previously assumed. Therefore, expectations about their potential contribution to improved management should be scaled down. At the same time, the extent to which such projects will enable industrialized countries to avoid reducing industrial pollution is also unlikely to be significant. Cost-effectiveness is likely to be highest where timber volumes in the first few decades after initial logging are comparable under conventional and improved logging. This is likely where topography is relatively flat, biodiversity values are low, wastage of felled timber is high and the policy environment is favorable. A number of proactive measures are suggested to expand the niche for forest management carbon projects. These measures are justified because the incremental carbon and biodiversity benefits in the long run may be higher than previous studies have indicated. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Soil loss was estimated by measuring dimensions of all significant rills and gullies along the road, as well as by measuring height of preserved soil pedestals in sidecast and fill material and on skid trails. Estimates of surface erosion from logging roads and skid trails were 272 ± 20 t ha-+ year-+ and 275 ± 20 t ha-+ year-+ respectively. However, owing to lack of connectivity of skid trails to the stream, much of the sediment mobilized on skid trails was stored either on adjacent hillslopes or the trails themselves, rather than being transported to the stream system, as was the case for the road. Steeper skid trails (&gt;20% gradient) had slightly higher erosion rates (320 ± 24 t ha-+ year-+ than trails with gentler gradients (245-264 t ha-+ year-+). Some 60% of the soil loss on logging roads comes from erosion of the running surface. Disturbed cut and fill material along the road supplied the remaining 40% of the soil loss from roads. Roads and skid trails had no designed drainage systems; runoff discharged onto the hillslope at 25 major discharge nodes from the logging road (690 m total length) and at 34 nodes from skid trails (2300 m). Sediment pathways were either fully or moderately connected to headwater channels at 64% of the logging road nodes, but at only 26% of the nodes emanating from skid trails. A detailed sediment budget revealed that 78% of the soil loss from the road system (including log landings) was delivered to the stream in the first 16 months after logging began. Most (90%) of the deposition from skid trails occurred below just three discharge nodes. Runoff from and onto skid trails often exacerbated the sediment connectivity to channels. Clearly, sediment discharge from logging roads was more highly connected to the stream than discharge from skid trails. Once in the channel, much of this sediment was temporarily stored in the floodplain and behind woody debris. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Discharge nodes; Flow pathways; Forest roads; Hydrogeomorphology; Malaysia; Road runoff; Sediment budgets; Surface erosion; Tropical rainforest","Sidle, R.C.; Disaster Prevention Research Inst., , Uji, Kyoto 611-0011, Japan; email: sidle@slope.dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642342989

This study considered the potential costs and benefits of including two 'best' management practices - the pre-harvest flagging of future crop trees (FCTs) and improved planning of skid trails - in adjacent 45ha plots, in conjunction with conventional planned diameter-limit logging in a lowland tropical forest in the Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia. The study also included a general assessment of FCT damage and timber waste associated with standard felling operations. The additional costs of flagging FCTs ≥30cm DBH were estimated to be US$ 0.38/ha. FCT flagging significantly reduced damage by 20% in felling gaps and by 10% along skid trails that received 2-10 skidder passes. A mean directional error of ±35° per tree felled was observed for felling operations, indicating that damage to FCTs during felling could be reduced through implementation of directional felling techniques. Improved felling techniques could increase mean timber utilization by as much as 0.16m3 or US$ 3.20 per tree felled through reduced wood waste associated with stump pull, a common problem observed during felling operations. Pre-harvest skid trail planning increased costs an estimated US$ 1.46/ha, but reduced mean skidder ""search times"" (min/m3 harvested) by 23% and unnecessary skid trails by 96%. Compared to normal harvesting operations, overall operational efficiency increased by approximately US$ 3.00/ha. Pre-harvest skid trail planning significantly reduced FCT damage along skid trails that received 2-10 skidder passes. The results of this study indicate that pre-harvest skid trail planning and improved timber felling techniques yield short-term financial gains relative to conventional management as well as potential long-term gains through FCT conservation and, therefore, warrant implementation. Forest certification groups should consider FCT flagging for inclusion in timber certification criteria for the region given its low cost and proven utility for maintaining timber stand quality. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The research relies on a detailed understanding of the remotely sensed signal of natural and logged tropical forests. The experimental study is based on a 100,000ha semi-deciduous forest located in the south-western part of the Central African Republic. This forest includes a protected area and an area allocated to timber production. Two Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images, six SPOT multi-spectral (XS) images and field information were used for the analysis. The 5-year interval between the two Landsat-TM images made it possible to study the forest regeneration dynamics. The SPOT XS time series was used to assess the respective influence of the season, the spatial resolution and the geometry of acquisition. While recent impact of tree fall can be detected, there is no way to identify the cause of a single tree fall, i.e. whether it was due to the natural forest dynamics, storm damage or logging. Nevertheless, logging activities were identified due to the local concentration of large gaps and the linear features of the skid trail. The logging trails are clearly detected but with different degrees of success depending on the image geometry. The seasonality and hazy atmospheric conditions did not significantly affect the detectability of the trails. The geometry of observation, i.e. the sensor viewing and sun illumination angles, appeared to be a key factor. More than 40% of the trail network can be missed when the geometry of acquisition is not suitable. Despite rapid canopy closure over the logging roads and skid trail surface, more than 50% of the network was still visible 5 years after the last timber extraction. However, the spatial resolution of the images became critical as soon as the contrast between trails and the forest vanished. On a 120m regularised image recorded right after the logging, more than 95% of the logging trail network was still visible, but only 34% was detected on a 5-year post-harvest image. These results led to the definition of the main specifications for a remote sensing-based system for monitoring and controlling the logging activities in tropical forests. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Illegal logging was reported to be the cause of 50% of the deforestation. Illegal logging is a very pressing issue in Indonesia that is threatening the sustainability of forest management. The detection of the single felling tree which can be characterized as a specific type of illegal logging can provide information for the assessment of related Criteria and Indicator (C&I) of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) and therefore support the certification of Sustainable Forest Management. This study aims to detect single tree felling in the tropical forest using Landsat-7 ETM+ satellite data and two types of classifiers i.e. maximum likelihood classifier and the sub-pixel classifier. Furthermore, it aims to assess the output of the first objective to support SFM through evaluation of specific C&I. Field data of new logged points representing single tree felling was collected during fieldwork in East Kalimantan, Indonesia in September 2003. The Landsat image was classified using maximum likelihood and sub-pixel classification. The results showed that the accuracy of the sub-pixel classification was higher than the maximum likelihood classification of the 30 m resolution image with an overall accuracy and kappa of 89% and 0.75 versus 79 % and 0.57 respectively. Consequently, more accurate detection of single tree felling can be achieved using the sub-pixel classifier and Landsat-7 ETM+ image. The extracted information can be characterized as planned or illegal with the use of GIS and expert knowledge which helped to identify specific indicators of SFM related with illegal single tree felling. The measurement of these indicators will ultimately support the SFM assessment.","Detection; Forest; Maximum likelihood; Su-pixel",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957099781

Field data were acquired in May/June 2003. The use of ASTER data allowed an improvement of the analysis of the occupation process in tropical forest areas. ASTER images have adequate spatial and spectral resolution and are an alternative to the remaining remote sensing data available. The data had a correction of the cross-talk problem, after realized a resampling from SWIR bands (spatial resolution 30 to 15 m), a atmospheric correction and rectification of ASTER images from both data sets 2002 e 2003. The input parameters for the neural network ART2 were optimized by genetic algorithm and the neural network was evaluated by a comparison of classification results with field data.

We developed empirical functions relating the occurrence of understory forest fires to landscape features near Paragominas, a 35-yr-old ranching and logging center in eastern Amazonia. An historical sequence of maps of forest understory fire was created based on field interviews with local farmers and Landsat TM images. Several landscape features that might explain spatial variation in the occurrence of understory fires were also mapped and co-registered for each of the sample dates, including: forest fragment size and shape, forest impoverishment through logging and understory fire, sources of ignition (settlements and charcoal pits), roads, forest edges, and others. The spatial relationship between forest understory fire and each landscape characteristic was tested by regression analyses. Fire probability models were then developed for various combinations of landscape characteristics. The analyses were conducted separately for years of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which are associated with severe drought in eastern Amazonia, and non-ENSO years. Most (91%) of the forest area that burned during the 10-yr sequence caught fire during ENSO years, when severe drought may have increased both forest flammability and the escape of agricultural management fires. Forest understory fires were associated with forest edges, as reported in previous studies from Amazonia. But the strongest predictor of forest fire was the percentage of the forest fragment that had been previously logged or burned. Forest fragment size, distance to charcoal pits, distance to agricultural settlements, proximity to forest edge, and distance to roads were also correlated with forest understory fire. Logistic regression models using information on fragment degradation and distance to ignition sources accurately predicted the location of >80% of the forest fires observed during the ENSO event of 1997-1998. In this Amazon landscape, forest understory fire is a complex function of several variables that influence both the flammability and ignition exposure of the forest.","Agricultural frontiers; Deforestation; ENSO; Forest fire; Fragmentation; Landscape structure; Tropical forest","Alencar, A.A.C.; Inst.

Pollinator activity at D. obtusifolius trees and subsequent seed production were recorded in three forest areas subject to differing intensities of S. siamensis extraction. The pollinator and plant understory communities in these areas were also noted. Forest areas subject to high S. siamensis extraction intensities had very high understory flowering plant cover, dominated by the exotic invader Chromolaena odorata. Activity of butterfly pollinators at D. obtusifolius trees decreased in these disturbed areas, although their abundance remained comparable to other forest areas subject to only moderate or no extraction. For sphingid moth pollinators, there was no difference across differentially disturbed forest areas in either abundance or in the proportion bearing pollen. Pollinator activity by birds increased at highly disturbed locations but was not sufficient to offset a decline in overall pollinator activity at D. obtusifolius canopies in areas of heavy S. siamensis extraction. Thus, extraction of S. siamensis indirectly affected the pollination of D. obtusifolius, primarily by causing changes in the foraging behavior of butterfly pollinators rather than their abundance. A shift in the relative abundance of floral nectar resources from the canopy to the understory, a consequence of S. siamensis extraction and invasion by C. odorata, led to a parallel shift in foraging location of the principal diurnal pollinators, the butterflies, toward the understory. Despite reduced pollination at disturbed sites, behavioral changes did not translate into a D. obtusifolius seed set effect, possibly because pollination by birds (or moths) at the disturbed site compensated for reduced butterfly pollination.","Compensation; Dipterocarpaceae; Disturbance; Invasive species; Pollination; Reproductive success, seed set; Tropical dry forest","Ghazoul, J.; Dept. of Environ.

Data on the structure and diversity of its breeding avifauna have mostly been collected in primeval old-growth stands, preserved within the Białowieza National Park (BNP). Mapping censuses repeated in space (plots, replicated in riverine, oak-lime-hornbeam and coniferous stands) and time (permanent plots, 28 years) reveal that the breeding bird assemblages are rich in species (29-52/season in a 25 to 33-ha plot), but of moderate overall density (40-120 pairs/10 ha). The latter is due to low, lower than in man-transformed areas, densities of the majority of particular species. Despite marked changes in vegetation structure, the composition of the breeding bird assemblage does not vary much across different primeval forest types, with a single breeding bird community inhabiting all of them, including treefall gaps. High richness of the BF avifauna stems from the Forest's geographical locality, as well as from a high level of the primeval avifauna retention. Over 95% of the 135-140 pristine species still breed there. Especially species-rich groups are birds of prey, owls, woodpeckers and Sylvinae warblers. Bird communities in the BNP and primeval tropical rain forests share many features, suggesting that natural differences between temperate and tropical forests were less pronounced in the past. The combination of high species richness with low densities of individual species is probably a feature of all pristine forests, independent of climatic zone. The BF avifauna must once have been typical of the ancient European forests and it has become so exceptional chiefly because it has preserved most of its pristine features. The BF thus constitutes an indispensable reference site for future studies of woodland bird biology. To ensure its survival should become a priority. Commercial logging, taking place over 80% of the Polish BF part, severely changes the Forest's structure and strongly affects the birds, especially species which depend on dead wood (Dendrocopos leucotos, Picoides tridactylus) and on old-growth stands. The small area protected as the BNP becomes an increasingly isolated ""island"", in which preservation of the primeval forest features seems to be impossible. In order to retain them, it is necessary to protect the whole BF area. © Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.

The influences of burn severity and recurrent fires were then examined across 28 plots that were all sampled three years after the fires. Foraging guilds differed in their responses to the gradient of increasing burn severity; most guilds declined, although arboreal granivores, frugivores, and nectarivores showed unimodal responses and arboreal gleaning insectivores increased. These responses were strongly correlated with associated changes in the habitat structure and reflected differences in resource abundance where this was quantified. Rates of species turnover were high, and there was virtually no species overlap between unburned forest plots and those that had burned in more than one El Niño dry season.

Nevertheless, illegal logging in some parts of the world is a centuries-old problem rooted in social conflicts over access to forest resources. We synthesize the papers in this volume, which analyze illegal logging issues in a variety of countries-Indonesia, Vietnam, India, Cameroon, Bénin, and Mexico-and from a variety of analytical perspectives-anthropologic, economic, political science, legal, and conservationist. We describe illegal logging activities and analyze the roles of key stakeholders such as governments, the private sector, local communities, and non-governmental organizations. We summarize the major policy recommendations presented by the authors in this volume, which include: broad anti-corruption initiatives beyond the forest sector, information-based approaches, conventional regulation and enforcement, and market mechanisms. Illegal logging is complex. It involves broad networks of power and influence that operate across many geographic, socio-political and economic contexts. It is not simply a qeustion of poor villagers with chainsaws. Effective interventions must identify the key players and their supporting networks of racketeers and timber launderers and give prosecutors the wherewithal to overcome their ability to manipulate political connections to evade conviction. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Some protected areas are co-managed by communities, conservationists, and governments to safeguard biodiversity and incorporate the elements of social justice (Western et al 1994; Stevens 1997a).1 And there are examples where people have secured their right to remain in an area and use the resources (Horowitz 1998). Protected areas have provided real benefits to people, such as protected watersheds, safe harbors for wildlife, and protection from logging and mining interests. However, many protected area policies have ignored social justice and human rights, resulting in devastation or decreased quality of life for people living in the vicinity. These have often been protected areas with an ""exclusive management"" strategy, which separate the interests of local communities from protected areas (Borrini-Feyerabend 1996, section 1). Such an approach is often called the ""Yellowstone Model"" and is troublesome to many. The International Alliance of the Indigenous-Tribal Peoples of the Tropical Forest explains, ""[O]f all the environmental problems facing indigenous peoples, some of the gravest threats come from protected areas... [these areas] have led directly to serious human rights abuses"" (International Alliance 1999, 44). At times exclusive policies have even been detrimental to the resources that they were intended to protect (Drijver 1992; Lowry and Donahue 1994; Ghimire and Pimbert 1997). © 2003 State University of New York.

The stimulating effect of those operations on forest dynamics and the recovery of the timber stock have been demonstrated in all the experimental plots settled in tropical forests, and in particular those of French Guiana. However, limitations have become apparent: (i) excessive canopy opening, which in the case of the Paracou experiments amounted to eliminating more than one third of the initial basal area, has no additional effect on diameter increments while it encourages stand invasion by pioneer and heliophilous species that have no market value; (ii) the stimulating effect of openings is limited in time when post-logging thinning or liberation is not economically feasible, as is the case in French Guiana, felling cycles should not be too long.

Minimum diameter cutting limits in mixed dipterocarp forests of the Malesia region lead to high felling intensities (10-20+ trees ha-1). Such extraction rates create massive stand damage (&gt;50% of the remaining tree population), which has a negative impact on the regeneration and growth of many harvested dipterocarp species. As such, the minimum diameter cutting limit approach is seldom compatible with sustainable forest management. Where basic ecological characteristics of the commercial species are considered in timber harvesting prescriptions, mixed dipterocarp forests appear capable of sustained timber yields, habitat conservation, and providing other goods and services. This paper first presents the main silvicultural systems developed in mixed dipterocarp forests of Western Malesia and then reviews current knowledge of dipterocarp biology to finally develop guidelines aimed at improving the ecological sustainability of production forests of Western Malesia. These guidelines, a pragmatic reflection of science and 'best guess' judgement, include: (1) integration of reduced-impact logging practices into normal management operations; (2) cutting of eight trees ha-1 or less (with a felling cycle of 40-60 years to be determined according to local conditions); (3) defining minimum diameter cutting limits according to the structure, density and diameter at reproduction of target species; (4) avoiding harvesting species with less than one adult tree ha-1 (diameter at breast height [dbh] ≥ 50 cm over an area of 50-100 ha); (5) minimizing the size and connectivity of gaps (&lt;600 m2 whenever possible); (6) refraining from treatments such as understorey clearing; and (7) providing explicit protection for key forest species and the ecological processes they perform. Further refinement is encouraged to allow for local conditions, and for other forest types.","East Kalimantan; Habitat conservation; Malesia; Mixed dipterocarp forests; Reduced-impact logging (RIL); Silviculture; Sustainable forest management; Tebang Pilih Tanam Indonesia (TPTI)","Sist, P.; Cirad-Forêt, , Belem-PA 66095-100, Brazil; email: sist@cpatu.embra.br",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347089189

Plots were ordered according to three main groups of damage and logging intensity. The first group G1 gathered slightly damaged plots with a remaining basal area ≥ 80% of the original (mean logging intensity = 6 trees ha-1). Plots belonging to G2, had a remaining basal area varying between 70 and 79% of the original one (mean logging intensity = 8 trees ha-1). Finally, G3 gathers highly damaged plots with a remaining basal area &lt; 70% of the original one and a high logging intensity (mean = 14 trees ha-1). The mean sustainable cutting cycles predicted in the three groups were significantly different and equal 27, 41 and 89 years in G1, G2 and G3 respectively. However, the respective mean annual extracted volumes were similar: 1.6, 1.8 and 1.4 m3 ha-1 year-1, respectively in G1, G2 and G3. The model suggests that a 40 year cycle, extracting 8 trees ha-1 (60 m3 ha-1) and an annual volume of 1.5 m3 ha-1 year-1 is the best option to preserve ecological integrity of the forest, to ensure yield sustainability and, according to existing cost analysis, economic profitability. This result is also consistent with other studies which already demonstrated that logging damage reduction using RIL techniques could be only significant with a moderate felling intensity not exceeding 8 trees ha-1. This felling intensity threshold can be easily achieved by applying simple harvesting rules.","Dipterocarp forest; East Kalimantan; Matrix models; Reduced-impact logging (RIL); Sustainable logging intensity; TPTI, modeling","Gourlet-Fleury, S.; Cirad-Forêt, , 34398 Montpellier Cedex 5, France; email: sylvie.gourlet-fleury@cirad.fr",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346993257

We investigated causes of this patchiness in selectively logged forests near the Danum Valley Field Centre (DVFC) in Sabah, Malaysia. In a recently logged forest, we compared seed sources and seedling establishment between two logging systems (conventional practices [CL] and reduced impact logging [RIL]) and between two soil disturbance classes (topsoil or subsoil exposed). Tree seeds were less abundant than shrub and treelet seeds, and seed banks contributed many more viable seeds than did seed rain. Topsoil removal reduced seed and seedling counts and growth rates of planted seedlings. More pioneer seedlings established on RIL than on CL plots, but survival of planted seedlings was lower under RIL, perhaps due to denser canopy cover. Broadcasting seeds increased seedling recruitment for five animal-dispersed pioneer trees but not for two wind-dispersed trees. Longer term survival and growth of pioneer seedlings were compared between logging gaps (canopy but not soil disturbed) and skid tracks (canopy and soil disturbed) at a second site. Relative numbers in gaps vs. skid tracks varied by species, but across species, seedlings grew 40% more rapidly in gaps than in skid tracks. Survivorship differed among species but not between habitats. The three most common species experienced >95% mortality within 42 months. At a third site, we compared effects of mammalian herbivores on pioneer seedling performances in exclosures and open (control) plots centered at the edge of recently abandoned skid tracks. Fewer pioneer seedlings established in skid tracks than in less-disturbed edges, but abundances did not differ between exclosure and control plots. Over 18 months, pioneers survived better and grew on average 44% taller with mammalian herbivores excluded. Pioneer colonization can be seed limited, but high seedling mortality, exacerbated by herbivore damage, can limit recruitment even when seeds are available. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper describes an analytical approach that involves the linkage of a simulation model of forest growth and yield to a financial model based on data from a forest concession in East Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo). The growth and yield model SYMFOR (silviculture and yield management for tropical forests) was linked to a financial model derived for a forest concession managed under the Indonesian selective logging and replanting system (TPTI). This combined approach was used in this study to predict the likely timber yield for contrasting management regimes and then to calculate estimates of the financial performance described as the internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) of the forest estate. This approach was used in a study that compared the standard TPTI system with alternatives that combined reduced impact logging (RIL) techniques with alternative systems of yield regulation. The TPTI system regulates timber yield using a single diameter limit given for each type of forest (currently two categories for lowland Dipterocarp forests and one for swamp forest). The alternative systems that were evaluated included one defined by a maximum of eight harvested stems per hectare and others based on maximum volume extracted of either 50 or 60 m3 ha-1. Each of these systems was evaluated for cutting cycle lengths of 25, 35 and 45 years. These management regimes were implemented for a simulated period representing three additional cutting cycles. The impacts of alternative management regimes were compared through statistical analysis of the results from the simulations that was able to remove the effect of the very significant variability between experimental plots. The results of this analysis clearly demonstrated that the conventional TPTI management system failed to achieve criteria of sustainability for timber yield and financial performance. Average yields dropped from over 80 m 3 ha-1 for the first simulated harvest from the logged-over area (second harvest) to between 35 and 40 m3 ha -1 for the third and fourth harvests. The financial analysis showed that this system was not viable after the second harvest leaving the only financially viable alternative of land conversion after clear felling of the remaining forest. The alternative management regimes based on reduced impact logging and more effective systems of timber yield regulation performed much better. The study suggested that management systems based on a cutting cycle of 35 years with yield regulated to 50 m3 ha-1 or 45 years with yield regulated to 60 m3 ha-1 were the best alternatives to the current TPTI system. Neither of these two alternatives was able to consistently achieve the desired internal rate of return of 16% unless there were also decreases in wastage associated with the harvesting and timber extraction. Optimisation techniques where used to determine the combination that would produce an internal rate of return of at least 16%. This process suggested that the concession studied would be able to achieve or exceed this criterion over all harvests when (a) a management regime involving a cutting cycle of 45 years is combined with a yield regulation system harvesting a maximum of 60 m3 ha-1 and (b) the efficiency of timber conversion increases from 52 to 60%. It is considered that this is readily achievable using existing methods and appropriate training. The methods described in this paper can be transferred to other concessions or countries and may be modified to utilise alternative growth and yield or financial models. The paper also indicates that the approach could be adapted to consider a wider range of goods and services provided by forests to extend the analysis into a more comprehensive economic analysis. A preliminary consideration of these issues demonstrated that the system of management selected on the basis of timber yield and financial performance will also provide benefits for the environment and local communities. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Methods: For twenty-two forest fragments (1) bivariate regression analyses of tree species diversity (number and composition) were employed with forest spatial geometry, climate and disturbance variables. (2) Multivariate regression analyses of tree species number and all seven environmental variables were used to determine the variability in tree species number that could be accounted for by these environmental variables. Results: Forest area, shape and isolation accounted for sharply decreasing proportions of variability in tree species diversity. Large forest fragments contained the greatest numbers of tree species and the highest proportions of rare tree species; irregular fragments had high proportions of regenerating, light-demanding pioneers and mature, animal-dispersed species and isolated fragments were floristically similar to less isolated fragments. Fire burn and average annual rainfall accounted for small, but nevertheless significant, proportions of variability in tree species diversity. Logging and agriculture were non-significant variables. Main conclusions: (1) Forest area is the most important consideration when planning tropical forest reserves. (2) Management of disturbance should take priority over management of forest shape if higher levels of tree diversity and species quality are to be maintained. (3) If new reserves are to be designated, they should be located within different climatic zones in order to capture a large fraction of the regional biota. (4) Biogeographers have an important role to play in formulating and testing hypotheses at a broad spatial scale and ultimately, informing conservation management within the tropical biome.","Biodiversity; Conservation; Fragmentation; Ghana; Regression analysis; Tropical forest","Hill, J.L.; Sch. of Geogr./Environ.

Species richness, as assessed by species-time curves and rarefaction, was higher in both altered areas than in undisturbed forest (INT). In general, frugivores and omnivores were more abundant in both altered areas compared to intact forest. Canopy frugivores, understory omnivores and multiple-strata omnivores were most abundant in HAR. Canopy frugivores, near-ground insectivores, understory and multiple-strata omnivores were least abundant in INT, although INT had the highest abundances of canopy insectivores and near-ground omnivores. Richness and abundance of widespread species with low habitat specificity was higher in both areas that experienced disturbance compared to intact forest. Differences in bird community structure between disturbed and intact forest at this site are attributed primarily to the addition of widespread species with less narrow habitat requirements, and possibly to changes in the distribution of different food types.","Birds; Bolivia; Community ecology; Habitat disturbance; Tropical bird community; Tropical forestry","Woltmann, S.; Dept. of Ecol./Evolutionary Biology, , New Orleans, LA 70118-5698, United States; email: Harpagus@yahoo.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037523259

The efficacy of liberation treatments designed to enhance the growth and survival of sapling regeneration was evaluated over a period of 2 years. Liberation treatments included manual cleaning of competing vegetation around commercial tree saplings occurring in logging gaps, or spraying competing vegetation near these saplings with one of two herbicides (2,4-D or glyphosate). Of the nine species harvested in each forest type, only two species in each type had relatively abundant regeneration in logging gaps (Hura crepitans L. and Schizolobium parahyba (Vell. Conc.) S.F. Blake in the humid forest and Centrolobium microchaete C. Martius ex. Benth. and Caesalpinia pluviosa DC. in the dry forest). After 1 year, liberation treatments significantly increased the diameter growth of saplings in the humid forest, but not during the second year (P = 0.09). In the dry forest, liberation treatments did not affect the diameter of liberated plants. Liberation treatments did not significantly affect sapling survival or height growth in either forest. Treatment costs were relatively low (US$ 1-2.3 per gap), but time until return on investment is long (20-30-year cutting cycles). Adjustments to liberation treatments, such as season and intensity of application may increase effectiveness of treatments. Problems observed in this study with the recruitment of commercial tree regeneration in logging gaps suggests the need for site preparation treatments and more judicious seed tree retention. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The model arising from this approach is able to establish norms of natural forest management pursuing the ecological objective of pristine tree species preservation in situ. Consistent with this objective is presented a set of factual sentences about the structure and dynamics of the tropical forest, specifically Atlantic forest. The logarithmic form of the diametric density distribution reveals cohorts of similar adaptive strategies and permits the statistical estimation of survival coefficients from the inventory of a pristine stand. As a consequence of the non-linearity of the density matrix, specific algorithms had to be worked out in order to simulate the dynamics of the pristine forest. Adjoining to the ecological objective of tree species diversity preservation the (simple) economic objective of maximum log output, together with the factual sentences (describing the forest reality from the point of view of a forester or a forest enterprise) entail logically the set of selection criteria or norms for tree felling. The use of these norms to a stand of Atlantic forest is described, demonstrating the preservation of the pristine structure and of all tree populations after logging under natural forest management in a cutting cycle of 23 years. Finally is demonstrated the incompatibility of current felling norms with the ideal of pristine tree-diversity preservation, as for instance the forest legislation for the state of Santa Catarina allowing the felling of 40% of trees with DBH (diameter at breast height) above 40 cm for at most four species. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that evaporation of intercepted rainfall is higher in the unlogged forest (11% of total gross rainfall) than in the logged forest (6%). These results were closely associated with the reduction in number of trees per hectare from 581 in the unlogged plot to 278 (52%) in the logged plot, or a reduction in terms of basal area from 38.6 to 13.8 m2 ha-1 (65%). The evaporation rate during and after rainfall has ceased, in canopy-saturated conditions, was calculated by an energy balance method, which relied on the modified Penman equation using directly determined microclimatic and canopy structure variables as inputs. The results obtained showed that the evaporation from wet canopies in this research area is driven more by advected energy than by radiative energy. In the unlogged plot, advective energy accounted for 0.38 mm h-1 of the 0.50 mm h-1 of evaporation, whereas radiative energy accounted for only 0.13 mm h-1.","Boundary layer conductance; Energy balance equations; Evaporation rate; Humid tropical rainforest; Indonesia; Volume balance method","Asdak, C.; Institute of Ecology, JI.

Based on quantitative sampling of seedlings, saplings, and trees, we assess whether particular sexual systems, pollination syndromes, or seed-dispersal modes are associated with successional stage, prior selective logging, woody growth forms, or patterns of abundance or rarity. We further examine the phylogenetic structure of these traits in the regional woody flora, testing explicit hypotheses regarding phylogenetic clustering of reproductive traits and habitat distributions. Animal dispersal and insect pollination predominate across all forest types and size classes. In second-growth trees, relative abundance of species with explosive dispersal, hermaphroditic flowers, and insect pollination is higher, and relative abundance of species with animal dispersal and mammal pollination is lower, compared to old-growth and logged forests. Overall, dioecy and wind dispersal are more frequent than expected in canopy trees, and hermaphroditic flowers are more frequent than expected in shrubs. Reproductive traits, growth-form traits, and relative abundance patterns show significant clustering within the supertree phylogeny. Patterns of trait distribution across forest types are closely linked with patterns of floristic composition at the genus and family level. Species-level associations among reproductive traits and woody growth form can be explained by phylogenetic correlations. Wind dispersal and hummingbird pollination are significantly concentrated in clades with hermaphroditic flowers, whereas wind pollination is concentrated in clades with unisexual flowers. Legacies of both phylogenetic history and forest disturbance structure the distribution of reproductive traits within and among tropical wet forest communities.","Costa Rica; Forest regeneration; Logged forest; Old-growth forest; Phylogenetic conservatism; Pollination; Reproductive traits; Second-growth forest; Seed dispersal; Sexual systems; Wet tropical forest","Chazdon, R.L.; Dept. of Ecol./Evolutionary Biology, , Storrs, CT 06269-3043, United States; email: chazdon@uconn.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042466520

The runoff plots were set up in two catchments in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, where conventional logging and Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) took place. Runoff plots were set up in forest areas with different levels of logging disturbances, i.e. harvesting areas (four plots), skid trails (six plots), and undisturbed/control areas (four plots). The magnitude of runoff and soil loss from skid trail plots were found to be the highest, followed by control plots and harvest plots. Canopy cover, sapling density, litter depth and woody debris appeared to be important ecological factors that determine the magnitude of soil loss. Tree canopy determines the size and erosive power of the raindrops. Sapling, litter layer, and woody debris protected soil surface, thus preventing soil detachment, and provided surface roughness that minimised soil particle movement down the slope. The roles of these ecological factors were less significant compared to rainfall in determining the magnitude of runoff. Canopy cover, sapling density, litter depth and woody debris can be measured quantitatively or qualitatively without complicated equipment and methods. Furthermore, they are sensitive to logging disturbance which make them suitable verifiers of soil erosion. Forest managers need to limit disturbance to these factors in order to minimise soil erosion in their logging operation areas. Monitoring of soil loss using runoff plots was cost-effective and provided valuable information about soil erosion risks caused by logging operations. Runoff plots clearly demonstrated site disturbances where the plots are located. Monitoring allowed more direct linkages to be made between management practices and their impacts on runoff and soil erosion, thereby enabling forest managers to identify problems and take appropriate preventive measures to improve their management practices. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Carbon stored in living biomass is estimated with a forest cohort model that allows for competition, natural mortality, logging, and mortality due to logging damage. Soil carbon is modeled using five stock pools, three for litter and two for humus. The dynamics of carbon stored in wood products is simulated with a set of pools for short-, medium- and long-lived products, and includes processing efficiency, re-use of by-products, recycling, and disposal forms.

Until very recently there have been no digital data from satellites for studying events that occur at scales of 10-1000 m2 over large areas (100-100 000 ha). Many phenomena of interest to ecologists, such as impacts of selective logging on forest processes, occur over large extents but at local scales. Here we report results from a pilot project to evaluate through visual interpretation the potential of newly available 1-m panchromatic and 4-m multi-spectral data from the IKONOS satellite, for studying forest structure, dynamics and logging impacts in logged and old-growth tropical moist forest. 2. The study area, the Mil Madeireira Itacoatiara Ltda site of Precious Woods Amazon, near Itacoatiara, Amazonas, Brazil, is managed using reduced-impact logging practices to minimize environmental impacts, and thus represents a lower bound for logging impacts in tropical rain forests. 3. The IKONOS image was georeferenced using uncorrected global positioning system (GPS) locations for 10 control trees whose crowns were clearly visible in the image. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the geometric transformation was 4 m, while the mean crown diameter of 50 randomly chosen trees in old-growth forest was 9.4 m. The fact that the RMSE was less than half the average crown diameter implies that it will usually be possible to locate from the ground crowns that are distinct on the image, given sufficiently accurate GPS locations. 4. IKONOS data are well suited for evaluating and monitoring logging impacts. Many impacts of logging were clearly observable in the image, including major and some minor roads, logging patios and larger logging gaps. Smaller extraction roads and logging gaps were not observable. 5. Many individual trees were distinct on the IKONOS image, indicating that it is now feasible to conduct demographic studies of tropical rain forest canopy trees based on repeated satellite observations. Linking these remotely sensed data to ground data will require improved GPS positions, because it is currently difficult to obtain accurate GPS readings in tropical rain forest understoreys. 6. Synthesis and applications. IKONOS 1-m and 4-m data were found to be useful for identifying individual trees as well as some logging management features in a tropical moist forest in central Amazonia. These data will have many applications for research and management of intervened and old-growth tropical forests, including planning and assessment of logging activities, as well as monitoring adherence to certification criteria such as those of the Forest Stewardship Council. Rapid development of these applications will come from building on existing data on forest structure and function, and by fostering collaborations between remote sensing scientists, ecologists and natural resource managers.","Amazonia; Georeferencing; IKONOS; Reduced-impact logging; Remote sensing; Tropical moist forests","Read, J.M.; Department of Geography, , Syracuse, NY 13244, United States; email: jaread@maxwell.syr.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038009401

A future increase up to 80 000 m3·year-1 is possible if all silvicultural and management standards are strictly observed. An analysis of stand development reveals that the portion of commercial dipterocarps decreases with time, while the portion of pioneer and understorey species increases.

Plantations can facilitate secondary forest regrowth by providing an understory environment more favorable for native plant recruitment than unmanaged degraded habitats. To better understand secondary forest development and to evaluate plantation use as a restoration strategy, we studied natural forest succession after plantation harvest in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We asked four questions concerning using plantations as a restoration tool. How does timber harvest affect forest succession? How does initial on-site recruit availability (e.g., seeds, seedlings) after logging influence successional pathways? How easily can forest succession be enhanced through intervention? How does using exotic timber plantations to restore forests compare with fire exclusion as a restoration strategy? Timber harvesting killed or severely damaged many native stems, hindering subsequent forest regrowth. Despite this setback, native stem densities 4-6 years after logging equaled or surpassed native stem densities in unlogged plantations, suggesting timber removal accelerated forest succession. Successional habitats with high and low initial densities of on-site recruits first diverged in forest structure and composition, but then converged for many of these variables within 6 years of logging. Intervening to accelerate forest succession met with mixed results. Removing non-tree vegetation did not enhance tree establishment, growth, or survival after 2 years. However, leaving standing, dead timber trees as perches for seed-dispersing birds seemed to increase seedling establishment relative to control areas. Mortality and growth of seedlings planted into successional habitats 1-2 and 5-6 years after logging were similar, and predicting individual species responses based on successional status was unsuccessful. We compared succession in unlogged and logged (5-6 years after logging) plantations to a similar aged site where fires were excluded but no plantation species established. Our results suggest excluding fire is a better strategy for promoting forest succession than establishing then not harvesting plantations. Fire exclusion versus establishing then harvesting timber are comparable restoration strategies differentially enhancing tree sapling recruitment and growth, respectively. While forest regeneration was successful where fire was excluded long-term fire exclusion may be difficult, and several non-ecological challenges to using plantations exist (e.g., the conflict of managing for biodiversity versus timber production). In summary, our research suggests managers should carefully weigh the risks of using plantations or fire exclusion against other forest restoration strategies. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The impacts of habitat disturbance on biodiversity within tropical forests are an area of current concern but are poorly understood and difficult to predict. This is due in part to a poor understanding of how species respond to natural variation in environmental conditions within primary forest and how these conditions alter following anthropogenic disturbance. Within this context, the main aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the gap and shade preferences of fruit-feeding butterflies in primary forest in northern Borneo can be used to predict species' responses to selective logging and thus explain changes in diversity and geographical distinctness in relation to habitat disturbance. 2. Overall, there was little difference in butterfly diversity between primary forest and forest that had been selectively logged 10-12 years previously. In contrast, there were marked differences in the composition of the butterfly assemblages in the two habitats, which were strongly associated with species' gap preferences and geographical distributions. In Satyrinae and Morphinae, those species with higher shade preferences and narrower geographical distributions were most adversely affected by logging, whereas cosmopolitan species with high light preferences benefited from logging. In Nymphalinae and Charaxinae the opposite was observed: those species with wider geographical distributions were adversely affected and those species with relatively restricted distributions were more common in logged forest. 3. These changes in butterfly assemblages were associated with changes in vegetation structure following selective logging, which resulted in much lower habitat heterogeneity with less dense shade and fewer open gaps in logged forest. Areas of dense shade, which were more common in unlogged forest, supported species of Satyrinae and Morphinae with restricted geographical distributions, whereas open gaps, which were also more common in unlogged forest, attracted widespread species of Nymphalinae and Charaxinae. These butterfly-habitat associations in primary forest explain the opposite responses of the two groups of butterflies to selective logging. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study highlights the need to sample at a sufficiently large spatial scale to account for impacts of disturbance on heterogeneity in forest environments. It also demonstrates how understanding the responses of species to natural variation in environmental conditions within undisturbed forest is crucial to interpreting responses of species to anthropogenic habitat modification. The results further indicate that selectively logged forests can make an important contribution to the conservation of tropical biodiversity, provided that they are managed in a way that maintains environmental heterogeneity.","Biodiversity; Lepidoptera; Nymphalidae; Rainforest; Sabah; Selective logging","Hamer, K.C.; Ctr. for Biodiv. and Conservation, , Leeds LS2 9JT, United Kingdom; email: k.c.hamer@leeds.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037328010

To achieve this, it is necessary to know the maximum logging intensity that can be used and how long the forest takes to recover from logging. Because little is known about the effects of selective logging on non-timber plant species, we examined the effects of logging intensity and time after logging on the diversity and abundance of fowering and fruiting understoty plants in a Central Amazonian forest near Manaus, Brazil. Logging was carried out experimentally at varying intensities in eight 4 ha plots in 1987 and three plots in 1993. Logging intensity ranged between 14 and 45 m3/ha of extracted timber. Three plots were left as controls. Each month, from October 1996 to September 1998, we recorded the number of individuals and species of herbs, shrubs, small trees, and small palms that were flowering and fruiting in six transects per plot. We found 107 species flowering and 111 species fruiting. The abundance of flowering plants was affected by time after logging, but not by the intensity of logging. The abundance of fruiting plants was not related either to time after logging or logging intensity. Richness of flowering and fruiting plants was related to time after logging, but not to the intensity of logging. The results indicate that selective logging, at the intensities and scale analyzed, does not cause reductions in flower and fruit production by the understory community. Both quantity and quality of resources for animals are maintained and possibly even increased in logged areas, shortly after logging takes place. As the levels of reproduction in plots logged 11 years before remained close to those in controls, maintenance of the understory community does not seem to be problematical.","Amazonia; Brazil; Herbs; Logging intensity; Reproduction; Selective logging; Shrubs; Tropical forest; Understory","Costa, F.R.C.; Coordenacao de Pesq. em Ecologia, C.

The Arapiuns wildfire also resulted in significant socioeconomic costs to local forest dwellers, namely crop losses and the decimation of many forest resources, including key game vertebrate species pursued by subsistence hunters, vines and woody lianas, and many fruit species.

In 1997-98, there was a severe El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drought, and annual surveys over a 4-y period showed that abundance of R. makuta was greatly reduced during the drought, but that populations quickly recovered after it. Monthly surveys over a 12-mo period of typical rainfall showed that high rainfall in the month preceding surveys significantly reduced butterfly abundance. Butterfly abundance and distribution did not differ between selectively logged and unlogged areas in either monthly or annual surveys and there was no difference between selectively logged and unlogged areas in the pattern of post-drought recovery. These results indicate that the abundance of R. makuta was significantly reduced both after high rainfall and during severe drought, but that these impacts were short-lived and were not affected by habitat disturbance. ENSO droughts on Borneo naturally often lead to widespread forest fires and thus impacts of ENSO events for butterflies are more likely to be due to indirect effects of habitat loss, rather than direct effects of drought on butterfly population dynamics.","Climate change; Drought; ENSO; Habitat disturbance; Lepidoptera; Ragadia makuta; Satyrinae","Hill, J.K.; Department of Biology, PO Box 373, York YO10 5YW, United Kingdom; email: jkh6@york.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037266577

Each case study presents parameters obtained from monitoring initial harvest entries into primary forests for planned, reduced-impact logging (RIL) and unplanned, conventional logging (CL) operations. Differences in cost definitions and data collection protocols complicate the comparative analysis, and suggest that caution is necessary in interpreting results. Given this caveat, it appears that RIL can generate competitive or superior profits relative to CL if the financial costs of wood wasted in the harvesting operation are fully accounted for. Increased operational efficiency is an important benefit of RIL, one that largely determines its cost-effectiveness relative to conventional practices. Uncertainties concerning the marginal benefits of RIL relative to familiar, profitable conventional practices pose an obstacle to broader adoption. Moreover, CL firms face few incentives to alter their operations unless they face dramatic changes in market signals. Adoption of RIL techniques as part of a long-term forest management regime faces additional challenges related to the opportunity cost of silvicultural prescriptions and timber set-asides to maintain productivity and ecosystem integrity. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Ants were collected from 61 trees, between 7 and 33 m in height, belonging to four tree species. Trees were growing in adjacent plots of forests characterized by different use and structure: an old primary forest, a primary swamp forest along a small river, and a secondary forest where selective logging was carried out for 30 years. A total number of 37,065 ants, belonging to 161 species in 30 genera were collected. Considering the high number of species found only once, the completeness of the canopy ant fauna was relatively high and of relatively similar magnitude as samples from the Neotropics or the Oriental region. Up to 37 ant species on a single tree, with an average of 18.2 species per tree, were found. Forty-four ant species (28.1%) were found only once, less than ten individuals were found for each of 88 species (54.7%), but 64.0% of all individuals belonged to one of five species. Considering the high numerical dominance of a few ant species like a Pheidole sp., Tetramorium aculeatum (Mayr) and a Crematogaster sp., there is some evidence for an ant mosaic in the lower canopy of the Budongo Forest. Individual numbers of ants were strongly correlated with nests in the fogged tree, though the ants were not homogeneously distributed in the tree crowns. Diversity measures that strongly depend on individual numbers such as the Morisita-Horn index or rarefaction methods were calculated, but results were not concordant with those of incidence-based estimates such as jack-knife calculations. Differences in ant species richness and faunal composition between tree species were low but more significant between forest types. The ant fauna in the secondary forest was less diverse with 12.6% fewer species compared to the primary forest sites. The average number of ant species per tree was significantly lower in the secondary forest (<20% of the species; F=8.03, df=59, P<0.01) than in the undisturbed forest types. Cataulacus, Leptothorax, Tetraponera, and Polyrhachis, which are typical canopy-dwelling ant genera, had a significantly higher diversity and frequency in the two primary forest types (F=4.17, df=53, P<0.05). Secondary forest trees are often younger, lacking dead branches and epiphytes which are important requisites for ant colonization on trees.","Arboreal ants; Biodiversity; Distribution pattern; Species richness; Tropical forest","Wagner, T.; Universität Koblenz-Landau, Universitätsstrasse 1, 56070 Koblenz, Germany; email: thwagner@uni-koblenz.de",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036923397

These forests represent highly fragmented components in the landscape matrix which are generally less than 100 ha in size. SF are found on privately owned land where they are contributing to on-farm income through logging and/or use of non-timber products. Hence, defining pure conservation goals for this forest type seems to be unrealistic. In this paper, we used the process-based model FORMIX3-Q to simulate successional processes and logging scenarios in SF exposed to different degrees of fragmentation (either facing non-forest land on only one side or totally surrounded by agricultural land) in the subtropical eastern part of Paraguay. We compared results with primary forest embedded in a similar matrix. Under light fragmentation, bole volume of SF approached primary forest values after about 50 years of succession. Species composition, however, was clearly distinct from primary forest over the first 200 years of succession. The development of bole volume and species composition in severely fragmented SF was similar to the less fragmented SF over the initial 50 years. However, limited seed input, largely confined to on-site seed sources in the severely fragmented SF, led to a decline in bole volume by about one-third compared to the reference value over the simulation period of 400 years. By applying a minimum felling diameter (MFD) of 35 cm in the lightly fragmented SF, first logging was only possible after 30 years, resulting in a mere 3.7 m3 ha-1 harvest. Highest timber yields were obtained with 10 yr cutting cycles and a maximum removal of 20 stems ha-1, though sustainable yields only resulted from lowering the MFD to 30 cm. Logging in severely fragmented SF accelerated the decline of bole volume. Overall, results suggest that timber production in SF without silvicultural treatments is low and hence does not constitute a viable option to diversify farm income. Only managed SF may serve this function. Research focusing on the elaboration of management options for SF, integrating as much as possible of the original vegetation, is needed. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Since seeds of numerous high-value tropical timber trees are nominally or actively wind dispersed, the subject is also of interest to tropical foresters. In central Africa, up to 70% of harvested timber trees are wind dispersed, including African mahoganies of the genus Entandrophragma. The dual goals of managing many remote areas in central Africa for both biodiversity and timber production values has led to the consideration of low impact logging techniques. In the Central African Republic, increasing light downwind of Entandrophragma has been proposed as a way of increasing regeneration and recruitment of these trees. Mean wind direction at the time of dehiscence of Entandrophragma angolense and Entandrophragma cylindricum was compared with compass orientation of seed shadows for five individuals in mature, undisturbed forest. Mean wind direction was found to be toward the northeast for morning, afternoon, and daily winds and was significantly different from the orientation of seed shadows for all trees. Mean branch direction did not vary significantly from a random pattern, but matched the direction of the seed shadow better than wind direction did. It is concluded that harvesting interventions aimed at increasing light downwind of Entandrophragma will not necessarily benefit seedlings of the species at the study site and further silvicultural research is needed to determine appropriate management interventions, particularly in remote areas of Africa where conservation values are important. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Paired conventional and RIL blocks were selectively logged with a harvest intensity of approximately 23 m3 ha-1 (geometric volume) in the dry seasons (July-December) of 1996 and 1998. Ground damage (roads + skid trails + log decks) in the conventional logging treatments occupied 8.9-11.2% of total operational area. In contrast, ground damage in RIL treatments ranged from 4.6 to 4.8% of the total area. Forest canopy damage was assessed using gap fraction measurements collected with an automated optical canopy analyzer (LAI-2000; Licor Inc.) in March 1999. Canopy opening varied by time since logging. The recently logged (1998) blocks had integrated canopy gap fractions of 21.6 and 10.9% of total area for conventional and RIL blocks, respectively. The blocks logged in 1996 had more closed canopies with 16.5 and 4.9% gap fraction for conventional and RIL blocks, respectively. For comparison, undisturbed forest had a canopy gap fraction of 3.1%. Measurements of ground disturbance and gap fraction using the Licor LAI-2000 generally agree with other field evaluations of RIL and conventional logging. Detailed understanding of canopy structural changes resulting from different logging intensities are critical to the prospect of logging damage estimation using current and future remote sensing products. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Estimates of areas likely to preserve an almost complete sample of the regional biodiversity amounted to about 1-2 million hectares, either in one large area (national park) or divided into 2-3 reserves overlapping regional hot spots.

For this, we took advantage of a mast fruiting event during year 2000 in a population (N = 870 individuals ≥10 cm dbh) of one of the dominant canopy tree species, Quercus costaricensis. The forest was selectively logged for timber between 1991 and 1992 under two harvesting intensities (20 and 30% basal area removal of trees ≥ 10 cm dbh). We found that more sound acorns fell per unit area in plots subjected to the highest harvesting intensity than in adjacent, unlogged plots (180,000 and 100,000 total acorns/ha, respectively); acorn production in the lightest harvesting intensity plots was marginally higher than in unlogged plots. We suggest that this result is largely due to the presence of small (10-30 cm dbh) trees that commenced their reproduction only in the logged plots. Our results also suggest that logging may have enhanced stand-level acorn production in Q. costaricensis by augmenting crown illumination levels in retained individuals: within plot types, the crowns of fruiting individuals were better illuminated than those not in fruit; among plot types, and for a given size class, trees in the unlogged plots had their crowns less well-illuminated than those in the logged plots. Because more sound acorns fell per unit area in the more intensively-logged plots, vertebrate predators apparently became satiated and left proportionally more acorns to germinate on the forest floor with respect to unlogged plots. Seedling densities from the 2000 acorn cohort mirrored the observed differences in acorn production and acorn survival between the more intensively-logged and unlogged plots. Acorn germination and seedling establishment success, however, did not vary among these plot types. Our results point out to the potentially beneficial role of controlled logging on stand regeneration in this montane forest, being detectable even one decade after its implementation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The forest was logged by a private company under a government concession. The harvest incorporated many reduced impact logging practices including pre-harvest tree inventories, planned placement of roads and skid trails, vine cutting, and directional felling. A total density of 4.35 trees/ha and 12.1 m3/ha of wood were harvested. It was estimated that logging disturbed 45.8% of the stand including 25% ground area disturbance in the form of skid trails, logging roads, and log landings and an additional 25% in canopy openings due to tree felling. On average, 44 trees were damaged for every tree extracted including 22 trees killed or severely damaged, 6 of them commercial species. The most common types of damage included uprooted stems, stem wounds to the cambial layer, and bark scrapes. Road width was found to be a significant factor determining the number of trees damaged along logging roads but not along skid trails. Damage to trees sustained along skid trails was found to be significantly less than the damage incurred along logging roads. Residual damage in felling gaps was positively related to the diameter-at-breast-height of the harvested trees. Comparisons with other planned operations revealed a higher percent ground area disturbed and a greater felling gap area per tree extracted. Higher ground area disturbance was mostly due to the greater area in skid trails, many of which appeared to be unnecessary. Larger felling gap sizes appeared to be at least partially attributed to the larger size of trees harvested relative to those in other forests. The results of this study suggest that reduced impact logging practices may also need to be accompanied by close supervision of field personnel, monetary incentives and/or disincentives to loggers, and post-logging site inspections to be implemented properly. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In a pilot study, how much high quality timber can be extracted from trees regarded as hollow by the felling team of the logging contractor was evaluated. The amount of extractable timber considered as timber of low-quality (upper stem parts, top portions, big branches) was also determined. At the same time whether the chain saw method is a reliable method for the detection of hollow stems was tested. Results of the study were as follows: Several trees, which the sawyer considered to be hollow on the basis of the chain saw method were not hollow at all. The chain saw method proved to be unreliable for the determination of hollow logs or the extent of the hollow. It is suggested that the chain saw method be substituted by the drilling method, which determines the actual wall thickness of hollow logs. Furthermore, it is suggested that the responsibility for the detection of hollow trees be switched from the sawyers to the tree marking teams. The hollow trees analyzed contained large amounts of good timber (68-99% of the log volume up to the first branch). In view of modern wood processing techniques (e.g. finger jointing) the quality standards for logs suitable for log sales have to be changed. The concept of logging residue utilization has to be promoted. Education of contract forestry workers, field staff of the Forestry Department and of the license holders is required in order to change attitudes regarding log quality. A different remuneration system for sawyers has to be developed and implemented. The sawyer has to be encouraged to extract as much timber as possible within the cutting limits and not be discouraged from doing so as is currently the case. Recovery studies are required to determine the amount of sawn timber and other products produced from hollow log parts and from logging residues like upper stem parts, top portions and big branches. The technical and economic aspects of hollow log and residue extraction need to be evaluated through case studies. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We devised a method of measuring changes in vegetation characteristics using standardized photographs of the forest understorey. We describe the method using a sample dataset of photographs taken at 28 stations in primary forest and forest that had been logged selectively eight years previously, at the Danum Valley Field Centre in lowland Borneo. The understorey photographs were digitized and eight measures of vegetation density and complexity generated for each image using FRAGSTATS. Parameters included vegetation area, total vegetation edge, and mean fractal dimension of vegetation patches. There were no significant correlations between the vegetation density measures and those representing vegetation complexity showing there to be two unrelated components to understorey variability. We used PCA to derive two principal axes from the eight vegetation parameters. There were no significant differences in our measures of understorey density or complexity between the primary and logged forest stations. There was, however, a greater range of understorey characteristics in primary forest than in logged forest indicating a loss of understorey heterogeneity following logging. Most apparent was a loss of very open and non-complex understories and this may affect some animals in a number of ways, including altering the abundance of their prey and altering their ability to forage successfully in logged forest. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

RIL systems are necessary, but not sufficient, for sustainable forest management because they reduce damage to the forest ecosystem during the initial forest entry. If conditions were identified where RIL costs were clearly less than conventional logging (CL) costs, then a strong incentive for RIL adoption would exist. In this paper, a comparison of costs and revenues was made for typical RIL and CL operations in the eastern Amazon. An economic engineering approach was used to estimate standardized productivity and cost parameters. Detailed data on productivity, harvest volume, wasted wood and damage to the residual stand were collected from operational scale harvest blocks. Productivity and cost data were also collected using surveys of forest products firms. The major conclusion of the study was that RIL was less costly, and more profitable, than CL under the conditions observed at the eastern Amazon study site. Full cost accounting methods were introduced to capture the direct and indirect costs associated with wasted wood. The impact of wasted wood on effective stumpage price provided the largest gain to RIL. Large gains attributable to RIL technology were also observed in skidding and log deck productivity. In addition, investment in RIL yielded an ""environmental dividend"" in terms of reduced damage to trees in the residual stand and reduction of the amount of ground area disturbed by heavy machinery. Developing institutions that can monetize the value of the environmental dividend remains a major challenge in the promotion of sustainable forest management in the tropics. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

I compared four forest treatments: unlogged native forest (UL), two that were selectively logged at low (LL) and high (HL) intensities in the 1960s, and a conifer plantation (PL). Forest-dependent birds were best represented at UL. LL was similar to UL in both vegetation structure and bird community composition, although some forest-dependent bird species were missing from the former. HL had significantly less canopy closure and lower tree density than other plots as a result of the combination of extensive secondary damage and natural disturbance patterns that prevented the reclosure of the forest canopy. Thirty-one percent of the forest-dependent bird species observed during the study were not detected at HL. At PL, bird species richness and bird abundance were about a third of those observed in other plots. There were significant correlations between heterogeneity of tree distribution (horizontal heterogeneity) and abundance and species richness of birds across plots. Abundance and species richness of all, forest-dependent, and forest generalist birds were highest in plots with intermediate measures of horizontal heterogeneity, which were mostly unlogged or lightly logged.

In some communities, declining abundance of NTFPs due to logging and fire has resulted in a lack of forest products to even meet subsistence needs. In areas close to cities where transportation is assured and where forest clearing has eroded the natural occurrence of some valuable native NTFPs, smallholders who manage and successfully market native fruit and medicinal species are overcoming these obstacles.

Log decks were quickly colonized by early successional plant species, resulting in significant gap fraction decreases within 1.5 years after site abandonment. Although log decks were the most obvious damage areas on the ground and in satellite imagery, they accounted for only 1-2% of the total harvested area of the blocks studied. Other forest damage features such as tree-fall gaps, skid trails, and roads were difficult to recognize in Landsat reflectance data or through textural analysis. These landscape features could be only crudely resolved in the most intensively logged forests and within about 0.5 years following harvest. We found that forest damage within any of the landscape strata (decks, roads, skids, tree falls) could not be resolved with Landsat reflectance or texture data when the canopy gap fraction was < 50%. The basic Landsat ETM+ imagery lacks the resolution of forest structural features required for quantitative studies of logging damage. Landsat textural analyses may be useful for broad delineation of logged forests, but detailed ecological and biogeochemical studies will probably need to rely on other remote sensing approaches. Until spatial gradients of canopy damage and regrowth resulting from selective logging operations in tropical forests in the Amazon region are resolved, the impacts of this land use on a continental scale will remain poorly understood. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Through economic modelling the article also attempts to quantify the global benefits generated. Eco-forestry is subsidized by donors directly and through NGOs in its setting up and certification. Financial modelling suggests that, with a subsidy, eco-forestry is capable of generating a return to landowners that is comparable to industrial logging. While the return to logging followed by conversion to agriculture is much more attractive than eco-forestry, agriculture is an option available only in some locations. Economic modelling finds that the external economic benefits emanating from tropical forest conservation that replaces logging in Papua New Guinea are far greater in scale than the financial benefits to landowners. However, the lack of reliable data on the environmental benefits of forest conservation means that economic analysis is somewhat inconclusive. The need for further research to quantify environmental benefits is thus highlighted. The subsidization of forest conservation directly, instead of indirectly through small-scale forestry, is investigated and found to generate a similar level of economic benefits to eco-forestry. However, the cost of direct subsidization is greater. Moreover, mechanisms for direct subsidy are undeveloped in Papua New Guinea. Donors may prefer to continue to subsidize small-scale forestry where it replaces logging because of its apparent conservation and side benefits and because it is operational, while at the same time exploring and extending cost-effective models of direct conservation that have the advantage over eco-forestry of being applicable in more remote areas. Compared with industrial logging, eco-forestry contributes little to consolidated revenue. Therefore it is to be expected that eco-forestry will meet government resistance if it makes significant inroads into the allocation of logging concessions.",,"Hunt, C.; Natl. Res.

They can also increase logging damage and slow tree growth. Liana cutting prior to logging is a silvicultural tool used to mitigate these negative effects. We assessed the effects of complete liana cutting followed by reduced-impact logging on liana abundance and species diversity. Eight years following liana cutting and 6 years following logging there was a 55% reduction in the stem density of climbing lianas ≥1 cm diameter in size. Liana basal area, aboveground biomass, and leaf area index decreased by approximately 85%. Coppicing of cut stems was the primary mode of liana recruitment. Liana cutting and logging resulted in a 14% reduction in the number of liana species present in a 0.20-ha sample, but a cumulative species-area curve suggested that this percentage might have been reduced if a larger area were sampled. Our results suggest that the silvicultural benefits of complete liana cutting - reduced logging damage and increased postlogging tree growth - need to be weighed against the costs of reduced species diversity of lianas and the possible effects on forest ecosystem functioning (e.g., reduced fruit and flower availability) that are likely to persist long after initial liana cutting.",,"Gerwing, J.J.; Department of Biology, , University Park, PA 16802, United States; email: jjg156@psu.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036222443

This study considers the impacts of small-scale logging on butterfly communities at three sites of varying disturbance intensity in a tropical dry forest in western Thailand. Butterfly species richness was similar at all sites, but the abundance of butterflies and diversity of the butterfly community decreased with increased logging disturbance. The recorded decrease in diversity at the relatively large sampling scale used lends further support to the hypothesis that disturbance effects are scale dependent. Species abundance data for butterflies fitted a log-normal distribution at all sites, but also a log-series distribution at the two disturbed sites. These analyses suggest a more complex butterfly community at the undisturbed site, but also that log-series and log-normal distributions may not to be sufficiently sensitive to be useful indicators of community changes following logging. Community ordination separates both the butterfly species and transect samples into three distinct regions corresponding to the three study locations. Ordination axes are correlated with tree density, understorey cover and understorey plant richness. Species with the smallest geographic ranges tend to be the least abundant and occurred most frequently in the undisturbed site. The observed diverging responses to disturbance among butterfly families diminishes the value of butterfly communities as biodiversity indicators, and forest managers should perhaps focus on restricted range species or of groups of recognized sensitive species for this purpose.","Community structure; Deciduous dipterocarp forest; Disturbance; Lepidoptera; Range size","Ghazoul, J.; T.H.

However, in the eastern Brazilian Amazon logging and ground fires degrade forest structure and create land cover types that are intermediate between intact and cleared forest. The objective of this study was to provide a basis for understanding the implications of forest degradation by comparing the impacts of varying intensities of logging and fire on forest structure and composition. Field inventories in forests whose impacts ranged from none to logged and heavily burned were conducted in 14, 10 m × 500 m plots located on 10 properties in the region of Paragominas, Pará, Brazil. Live aboveground biomass of intact forest was estimated at 309 t ha-1. Following moderate intensity logging (35 m3 ha-1 removed), this value was decreased by 20%, but a 48% reduction was observed following high intensity logging (69 m3 ha-1 removed). Light burning of moderately logged forest resulted in a total biomass reduction equal to that of high intensity logging whereas moderately logged and heavily burned forest had 83% less live biomass than intact forest. Recovery of pre-degradation biomass and forest structure is likely to be impeded by abundant lianas and the high incidence of crown and stem damage in the residual stands. Although burning killed the majority of large diameter woody vines, increase in the abundance of lianas &lt;1 cm diameter, (mean stem density 4100 ha-1 in lightly burned stands and 9355 ha-1 in heavily burned), more than compensated for these losses in terms of total liana density. In addition, increased amounts of coarse woody debris and greatly reduced canopy cover in both heavily logged and heavily burned forests have increased the risk of future fires that could further degraded these forests. As more and more logging frontiers in the eastern Brazilian Amazon mature it is likely that repeated logging of previously logged stands will become more common. This combined with the increased flammability of previously burned stands is likely to result in the spread of forest degradation unless incentives can be developed to encourage the use of low impact logging techniques and the development of cost effective fire prevention methods. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We compared the effects of past land use, topography, soil type, and other environmental variables on tree species composition in a subtropical wet forest in the Luquillo Mountains, Puerto Rico. The study involved stems ≥ 10 cm diameter measured at 130 cm above the ground, within the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP), and represents the forest at the time Hurricane Hugo struck in 1989. Topography in the plot is rugged, and soils are variable. Historical documents and local residents described past land uses such as clear-felling and selective logging followed by farming, fruit and coffee production, and timber stand improvement in the forest area that now includes the LFDP. These uses ceased 40-60 yr before the study, but their impacts could be differentiated by percent canopy cover seen in aerial photographs from 1936. Using these photographs, we defined four historic cover classes within the LFDP. These ranged from cover class 1, the least tree-covered area in 1936, to cover class 4, with the least intensive historic land use (selective logging and timber stand improvement). In 1989, cover class 1 had the lowest stem density and proportion of large stems, whereas cover class 4 had the highest basal area, species richness, and number of rare and endemic species. Ordination of tree species composition (89 species, 13 167 stems) produced arrays that primarily corresponded to the four cover classes (i.e., historic land uses). The ordination arrays corresponded secondarily to soil characteristics and topography. Natural disturbances (hurricanes, landslides, and local treefalls) affected tree composition, but these effects did not correlate with the major patterns of species distributions on the plot. Thus, it appears that forest development and natural disturbance have not masked the effects of historical land use in this tropical forest, and that past land use was the major influence on the patterns of tree composition in the plot in 1989. The least disturbed stand harbors more rare and endemic species, and such stands should be protected.","Biodiversity; Conservation; Disturbance; Land use history; Luquillo Experimental Forest; Puerto Rico; Soil; Species diversity; Topography; Tree community; Tropical forest","Thompson, J.; Inst. for Tropical Ecosystem Studies, P.O.

We compared three forest fragments currently managed for timber (140-350 ha) and a large reserve of continuous forest (La Selva, 1500 ha and connected to a national park). An exclusion experiment was performed (seeds placed in the open vs. seeds within semipermeable wire cages; 5 cm mesh size) to evaluate the relative roles of large and small animals on seed removal. Seed germination capacity did not differ among all four sites for both species. Removal of Dipteryx seeds was higher in forest fragments (50% removal within 10 days and related to the activity of small rodents) compared to La Selva (50% removal after 50 days). Also, more Dipteryx seeds were dispersed at La Selva than in fragmented forests. Contrary to our predictions, removal of Carapa seeds was equally high among all four sites, and there was a trend for more seeds of Carapa to be dispersed in fragments than in La Selva. Our results suggest that fragmentation effects on tree seed fate may be specific to species in question and contingent on the animal biota involved, and that management strategies for timber production based on regeneration from seed may differ between forest patches and extensive forests.","Carapa guianensis; Costa Rica; Defaunation; Dipteryx panamensis; Forest fragmentation; Seed dispersal; Seed removal; Selective logging; Tropical wet forest","Guariguata, M.R.; U. de Manejo de Bosques Naturales, , 7170 Turrialba, Costa Rica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036769339

If logging impacts on nontimber species are low and little time is required for recovery, logged forests could be compatible with conservation of some elements of the understory flora. As many nontimber species may have commercial value, knowledge about the impacts of different logging intensities is necessary to determine levels of timber extraction compatible with multiple use of forests. In this study, we examined the effects of logging intensity, time after logging, and skidder tracks, on the composition and diversity of the ground-level herb community of a terra-firme forest in central Amazonia. Logging was carried out at varying intensities in eight 4-ha experimental plots in 1987, three plots in 1993, and five plots were controls. Herb community composition, analyzed with hybrid multidimensional scaling (HMDS), was not significantly affected by logging intensity, but was significantly related to the area covered by logging gaps and skidder tracks. There was no significant difference in community composition and richness between treatments with different times after logging. Species richness was also not related to the logging intensity. Some species (18.2%) were found only in logged plots and were mainly from habitats outside the rain forest. There were significant differences in herb composition between controls and skidder tracks, but recent and old skidder tracks were mixed in the ordination space, suggesting that recovery in skidder tracks is slower than in other areas affected by logging. Overall, our results indicate that the ground herb community is not severely affected by selective logging at the intensities used in this experiment. The alterations in composition are mainly local, and restricted to the most disturbed patches. We conclude that forests managed with logging intensities similar to those used in this experiment could be compatible with conservation of understory herbs. Skidder tracks should be minimized, as they have the greatest long-term impact and allow species from other habitats to invade the forest.","Abundance; Central Amazonia; Composition; Diversity; Forest conservation; Herb; Logging intensity; Selective logging; Skidder track; Tropical forest; Understory","Costa, F.; Coordenacao de Pesq. em Ecologia, Caixa Postal 478, CEP: 69011-970 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; email: anfe@inpa.gov.br",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036628177

Logging was carried out experimentally at various intensities in eight plots (4 ha each) during 1987 and three plots in 1993. Five plots were left as experimental controls. In 1998, total and adult densities of the two species were greater in the plots logged 11 years before than in controls. For I. arouma, total and adult densities were also higher in the plots logged 5 years before; however, juvenile densities were less affected. The intensity of logging influenced adult density of both species but not total or juvenile densities. Densities of reproductive individuals of both species were higher in the logged areas and increased with logging intensity. The effects of time after logging and logging intensity on reproduction were indirect due to the greater number of adult plants in those areas. The observed effects were probably mediated by changes in canopy cover in logged areas. Greater light intensities in logging gaps, roads, and their margins may lead to increased reproduction, recruitment, growth, and survival, which in turn can lead to increased plant density. These results indicate that logging has long-term effects on understory plant populations.","Central Amazonia; Forest conservation; Herb; Logging intensity; Marantaceae; Non-timber products; Selective logging; Tropical forest","Capellotto Costa, F.R.; Coordenacao de Pesquisas em Ecologia, C.P. 478, CEP: 69011-970, Manaus, AM, Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036309210

This occurs because forest remnants have dry, fire-prone edges, are juxtaposed with frequently burned pastures, and are often degraded by selective logging, which increases forest desiccation and fuel loading. Here we demonstrate that in eastern Amazonia, fires are operating as a large-scale edge effect in the sense that most fires originate outside fragments and penetrate considerable distances into forest interiors. Multi-temporal analyses of satellite imagery from two frontier areas reveal that fire frequency over 12-14-y periods was substantially elevated within at least 2400 m of forest margins. Application of these data with a mathematical core-area model suggests that even large forest remnants (up to several hundred thousand ha in area) could be vulnerable to edge-related fires. The synergistic interactions of forest fragmentation, logging and human-ignited fires pose critical threats to Amazonian forests, particularly in more seasonal areas of the basin.","Amazon; Brazil; Carbon emissions; Conservation; Deforestation drought; Fire; Habitat fragmentation; Logging; Rain forest; Remote sensing; Tropical forest","Laurance, W.F.; Smithsonian Tropical Res.

Both methods of timber harvesting showed impacts on ant community composition when compared with unlogged forest, although these impacts did not include modifications in total species richness or the relative contribution of each ant subfamily to the total number of species. Instead, logging induced alterations took place at the level of species and genera. A 2-fold reduction in the dominance of ants of the highly diverse genus Pheidole was associated with forest alterations in high-impact logging sites. Thus, logging in Amazonia can be seen to promote species shifts in ant communities, without, however, altering species richness.

These forests register the imprint of ancient Maya uses and selective logging in the recent past, but significant modern conversion of them for agriculture began in the 1960s. Subsequently, as much as 10% of the region's forests have been disturbed anthropogenically. The precise rates of conversion and length of successional growth in both upland and wetland forests are tied to policy and political economic conditions. Pressures on upland forests are exacerbated by the development of infrastructure for El Mundo Maya, an archaeological and ecological activity predicated on forest maintenance, and by increased subsistence and market cultivation, including lands on the edge of Mexico's largest tropical forest biosphere reserve.

The magnitude of this threat is amplified by three positive feedback loops that drive the expansion of forest fire in the region: (1) Fire promotes drought, and therefore more fire, by releasing smoke into the atmosphere, thus reducing rainfall. Fire-assisted conversion of forests to pastures may also promote drought by increasing albedo and decreasing water vapor flux to the atmosphere, further inhibiting rainfall. (2) Fire increases the susceptibility of forests to recurrent burning by killing trees, thereby allowing sunlight to penetrate the forest interior, and increasing the fuel load on the forest floor. (3) Finally, fires also self-perpetuate by burning agricultural and forestry systems, discouraging landholders from making those fire-sensitive investments in their land that would allow them to move beyond their dependence upon fire as a management tool. The long-term reduction of Amazon fire, and its substantial costs to society, is most likely to emerge through investments and policy change that stimulate permanent agricultural and forestry production systems within existing frontiers while slowing the rate of frontier expansion. But the Brazilian government's plan to pave, recuperate or construct 6245 km of roads in the Amazon may have the opposite effect. We present research findings that the government plan would nearly double the area of forestland that is accessible by paved highways, including 192,000 km2 of fire-prone forest. Our analysis finds that these roads will stimulate 120,000-270,000 km2 of additional deforestation, and forest impoverishment through logging and understory fire, if the historical relationship between road paving and forest alteration by humans continues. Infrastructural investments are urgently needed in Amazônia to help integrate isolated urban centers into the market economy, to improve the quality of life for millions of rural Amazonians, and to improve the profitability of agribusiness in Brazil's agricultural belt. But as currently planned, these investments will have the ancillary effects of accelerating deforestation, logging, forest fire, smoke-related illness, and the displacement of small-scale farmers. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The growing importance of uplands as catchments for water production, biodiversity conservation and other downstream services has been recognized by the Sri Lankan government. It is therefore timely that we review 15 years of research investigating rain forest dynamics of southwest Sri Lanka with the objective of using this knowledge for forest restoration. We provide six common principles for understanding the integrity of rain forest dynamics in southwest Sri Lanka. The principles are: (i) disturbances provide the simultaneous initiation and/or release of a new forest stand; (ii) that disturbances are generally non-lethal to the groundstory vegetation; (iii) disturbances are variable in severity, type and extent across rain forest topography; (iv) guild diversity (habitat diversity) is dependent upon ""advance regeneration""; (v) tree canopy stratification is based on both ""static"" and ""dynamic"" processes; and (vi) canopy dominant late-successional tree species are site specialists restricted to particular topographic positions of the rain forest. These principles are applied to determine effects of two rain forest degradation processes that have been characterized as chronic (continuous detrimental impacts) and acute (one-time detrimental impacts). Restoration pathways are suggested that range from: (i) the simple prevention of disturbance to promote release of rain forest succession; (ii) site-specific enrichment planting protocols for canopy trees; (iii) sequential amelioration of arrested fern and grasslands by use of plantation analogs of old field pine to facilitate secondary succession of rain forest, and plantings of late-seral rain forest tree species; and (iv) establishment and release of successionally compatible mixed-species plantations. We summarize with a synthesis of the restoration techniques proposed for reforestation using native vegetation on cleared conservation areas and parks, and for the stabilization of eroded upland watersheds. We conclude with a comparative analysis with restoration work done in other tropical forest regions. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

This study investigates the impact of logging in Thailand and forest fragmentation in Costa Rica on the pollination and seed production of two self-incompatible forest trees. Logging in a dry deciduous dipterocarp forest in Thailand resulted in reduced densities of the common dipterocarp tree Shorea siamensis and variably isolated individual trees. The number of flower visits to S. siamensis by pollinating Trigona bees was not affected by logging disturbance. However, pollinators did spend longer periods of time foraging in the canopies of isolated trees which were more prevalent in logged areas where tree density had been reduced. Consequently, at the logged site few cross-pollinations were effected and fruit set of S. siamensis was considerably lower than at nearby unlogged sites where distances between flowering conspecifics were smaller. Reduced fruit set has long-term implications for the recovery of S. siamensis populations in disturbed areas, and local population genetic structure is likely to be affected as reduced outcrossing rates among trees in disturbed regions results in relatively inbred seed. In Costa Rica forest fragmentation has restricted the once widespread tree Anacardium excelsum to forest patches located in an agriculturally-dominated landscape. As with S. siamensis, the abundance of pollinators, also Trigona bees, in the canopies of A. excelsum was largely unaffected by fragment size. Nevertheless, pollination success and seed production was positively correlated with fragment size. We propose that small bees rarely move between forest fragments and gene exchange through pollination occurs predominantly among trees within fragments and, together with likely low genetic variability in small fragments, that this contributes to the observed reduced fertilisation and seed set of A. excelsum. Thus increased tree isolation tree through selective logging or habitat fragmentation by forest clearance can result in reduced seed set due to changes in the foraging patterns of poorly mobile pollinators. Even if population sizes of the pollinators are maintained following environmental perturbation, this study shows that disturbance may disrupt pollination processes through changes in pollinator foraging behaviour. More attention needs to be focussed on changes in the behaviour of species involved in key ecological interactions following disturbance events in tropical forests.","Anacardium excelsum; Canopy biology; Costa Rica; Dipterocarpaceae; Dry deciduous Forest; Forest fragmentation; Functional redundancy; Logging; Pollination; Shorea siamensis; Thailand; Tree regeneration; Trigona","Ghazoul, J.; TH H.

As selective-logging of tropical forest leaves a very complex mosaic of canopy types, it is likely to add to the spatio-temporal complexity of this sub-canopy or net precipitation. As a precursor to addressing this problem, the analysis presented here will examine the two dominant biophysical controls on sub-canopy precipitation. These controls are: (a) the spatial and temporal patterns in above-canopy or gross rainfall, and (b) the rate of wet-canopy evaporation associated with each type of canopy structure created by selective-forestry. For this study, over 400 raingauges were installed within a 10 km2 area of lowland dipterocarp forest affected by selective-forestry some 9-years prior to this work. Gauges were located beneath various canopy types and within large openings. The spatial distribution of gross rainfall (monitored within the openings) was modelled using variography, while the effects of different canopy types on sub-canopy preciptation was analysed by comparing 6-month totals. The temporal distribution of gross rainfall over an 11-year record collected at the same site (Danum Valley Field Centre) was modelled with Data-Based-Mechanistic (DBM) approaches. These DBM approaches were also applied to the rainfall time-series of the two adjacent meteorological stations; all three gauges being contained within a 5000 km2 region of Eastern Sabah in Malaysian Borneo. Strong diurnal modulation was apparent within gross rainfall for the inland rainforest site, with a distribution consistent with a dominance of local convective rain cells. A similarly strong cycle coincident with the periodicity of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was present within all of the region's rainfall records, though marked differences in annual and intra-annual seasonality were apparent. The preliminary variogram modelling indicated that a deterministic drift was present within the local-scale gross rainfall data, probably related to local topographic effects. Notwithstanding the need to remove this drift, the work indicated that spatial models of gross rainfall could be identified and used to interpret similar models of net-precipitation. During the ENSO drought-period monitored, the lowland dipterocarp forest allowed 91% of the gross rainfall to reach the ground as throughfall. These rates were, however, reduced to between 80%-86% beneath representative plots of moderately impacted to creeper-covered, highly damaged patches of forest.","ENSO; Interception loss; Time-series modelling; Variogram; Wet canopy evaporation","Chappell, N.A.; Ctr.

Secondary forests are an increasingly prominent feature of tropical landscapes and fires play a significant role in both the creation and destruction of these forests. In the past two decades large-scale forest fires have become more frequent in the moist tropics. In addition to climatic factors, the nature of tropical forests appears to be changing and becoming, as a consequence, more predisposed to burning. Secondary forests arising from intensive logging, in particular those that are in a degraded condition, are particularly vulnerable to repeated burning and further degradation. There has been limited general success in fire prevention and rehabilitation of secondary forests affected by fire. In addition, forest policy is not yet sufficiently attuned to address the management needs of the ever-increasing area of secondary forests affected by or developing following fire. Little is known about the exact extent and economic value or potential of post-fire secondary forests in Asia. It is clear, however, based on the experience of the past two decades, that there has been a significant increase in secondary forest affected by fire, particularly in Indonesia. Rough estimates for Indonesia infer that there could be as many as 5 million ha of post-fire secondary forests following the 1997-98 fires. Based on this knowledge alone, it would seem that post-fire secondary forest is already an important forest type that will provide important goods and services both to the environment, the state and local communities alike, as the area of primary forest diminishes through over-exploitation and conversion.","Fire; Indonesia; Kalimantan; Secondary forests","Dennis, R.; Center for Intl.

This paper examines the characteristics and dynamics of secondary forests in the country. In the last century, the country lost 50% of irs natural tropical forest cover. At present, the major land cover types in terms of areal coverage are upland farms, secondary forests, protected forests, brushlands, grasslands and tree plantations. The two most dominant types of secondary forests are post-extraction secondary forests and swidden fallow secondary forests. The former stems from legal and illegal logging, which are ultimately rooted in corruption, poverty and high population pressure. At present, post-extraction secondary forests are the main source of wood products of the country. Although secondary forests initially increase as a result of heavy commercial logging, they subsequently decrease due to degradation to brushland and conversion to agriculture. Swidden fallow secondary forests are generally associated with indigenous cultural communities who derive many ecological and socio-economic benefits from them. However, there are very limited quantitative data available on these forests, including areal coverage. The paper emphasises the need for research efforts directed at the sustainable use and conservation of secondary forests in the Philippines.","Land use change; Logging; Philippines; Policies; Secondary forests; Swidden agriculture","Lasco, R.D.; Environmental Forestry Programme, , 4031 Laguna, Philippines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035497336

At plot scales over a 20-year period, forest inventory data (representing areas < 750 ha) have shown stands to be accumulating above-ground biomass pantropically while displaying signs of increasing turnover. To assess whether or not such disequilibrium is manifest at broader spatial scales (i.e. coarser grain sizes and larger extents), we performed a change detection analysis of landscape texture (i.e. the organization of reflective properties), in satellite images of closed-canopy tropical rain forests considered to be anthropically undisturbed. Here we show that fractal properties of pixel spectral values depicting low and high levels of photosynthetic activity underwent significant shifts from the 1970s to the 1980s. Following expectations for aggrading forests, canopy texture became more random throughout the tropics. Although subject to periodic disturbance events such as natural exogenic perturbations and/or synchronous die-off, which should produce no consistent trend, these forested landscapes across the globe exhibited similar dynamics at fine temporal (decadal) intervals. Such biophysical changes (representing areas > 1000 000 ha) directly affect atmospheric boundary layer conditions and could have implications with respect to biodiversity and carbon cycling in these systems.","Canopy; Fractal; Global change; Lacunarity; Satellite imagery; Spatial pattern; Texture; Tropical rain forest","Weishampel, J.F.; Department of Biology, , Orlando, Florida 32816-2368, United States; email: jweisham@mail.ucf.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034951290

An important example is provided by the Kayapó territories which span more than 13 million ha in Pará and Mato Grosso, Brazil, and protect a unique and vulnerable Amazonian forest type that is poorly represented in existing nature reserves. The Kayapó of southern Pará have stopped invasion of their lands by the most perverse threats to Amazonian forests, but they have become involved extensively in the sale of illegal logging concessions for the high-value timber species mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla). In 1992, the non-governmental organization Conservation International do Brasil (CI-Brasil) began a conservation and development project with the Kayapó community of A'Ukre with the objective of providing economic alternatives to logging and protecting a population of mahogany trees. This paper demonstrates the conservation benefits that can be achieved by supporting sustainable development of indigenous peoples in the Amazon. Specifically, we: (1) evaluate the ecological importance of the Kayapó reserves from a biodiversity conservation viewpoint, (2) evaluate the conservation success of the CI-Brasil project and test whether the implementation of the conservation alliance between A'Ukre and CI-Brasil satisfies common pool resource principles, and (3) propose a model for expanding the small-scale conservation results achieved by the CI-Brasil project to all Kayapó territories. Several mammals (Tayassu pecari, Pteronura brasiliensis, Priodontes maximus, Panthera onca) and at least one bird species (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) listed as endangered were regularly encountered within 15 km of A'Ukre. Taxa encountered at relatively high densities in the project area included large cracids, lowland tapir, and white-lipped peccary, indicating an ecosystem that is not severely impacted by hunting. Harvest offtakes of mahogany averaged 0.44 stems ha -1 within groves and 0.13 stems ha -1 at the landscape level. We estimate that 85% of the fruiting population of Swietenia macrophylla has been removed in harvested Kayapó territories in Pará. We found Kayapó social organization in A'Ukre to meet criteria of successful common pool resource institutions. The CI-Brasil project resulted in protection of an intact mahogany population in 8000 ha of forest maintained by the community for ecological research purposes and mahogany preservation. Our analysis attributes the success of the conservation alliance with A'Ukre to: (1) direct benefits accruing to all members of the community, (2) fulfillment of criteria for development of common pool resource institutions, and (3) long-term commitment of an external agency. We propose that by implementing these three elements elsewhere, the modest conservation result achieved at A'Ukre could be expanded to include the entire Kayapó nation and thereby contribute to conservation of more than 13 000 000 ha of forest and cerrado in the south-eastern Amazon.","Amazon forest; Biodiversity conservation; Common pool resource institution; Conservation and development project; Indigenous community; Kayapó Indians; Swietenia macrophylla","Zimmerman, B.; Faculty of Forestry, 33 Willcocks Street, Toronto, Ont.

Identification of future crop trees before logging, a reduced impact practice, does more than merely make it possible to protect them. It makes possible also the determination of nearby trees that can be expected to inhibit the future growth of the crop trees. To the degree that these potential inhibitors are merchantable their incorporation in the harvest can accomplish at least part of the needed crop tree liberation at little cost or even at an immediate profit.

Tropical forestry is modelled as the mining of a heterogeneous, non-renewable resource. Two different harvesting procedures - sequential and simultaneous harvest, are examined. The analysis suggests that logging will be reduced if timber trade restrictions reduce the log price equally for all tree qualities. But if the price reduction is non-uniform, logging may increase in some fields. In fact, total logging may increase as well. It is also shown that timber trade restrictions do not necessarily promote the conversion of forestland to alternative uses. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, we examined the ecological characteristics of timber tree species in a tropical dry forest and a tropical humid forest in Bolivia in order to classify species into groups according to the relative quantity of seed trees to be retained. Seed tree groups ranged from species that regenerate mostly from sprouts and require few (if any) seed trees, to rare tree species that reproduce primarily by seed, but with poor seed production, germination, and seedling survival that will likely require the retention of many seed trees to maintain current densities. Best management practices should consider these species differences when formulating guidelines for seen tree retention.","Bolivia; Forest regeneration; Seed tree; Sustainable logging; Tropical forests","Fredericksen, T.S.; Proyecto BOLFOR, Santa Cruz, Bolivia; email: nelltodd@bibosi.scz.entelnet.bo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035297959

Intraspecific and interspecific variation in leaf damage and leaf expansion rates were measured on dipterocarp seedlings planted into secondary forests 1, 5 and 15 y after logging, and in adjacent primary forest of Sabah, Malaysia. Herbivory rates or amounts of leaf damage were compared across habitats and species for expanding, recently expanded, and mature leaves of Shorea leprosula and Dryobalanops lanceolata (Dipterocarpaceae). In all four habitats, leaves of the faster growing S. leprosula sustained higher rates and amounts of leaf-area loss than did the tougher leaves of slower growing D. lanceolata. Expanding leaves accumulated more leaf-area loss per week than did mature leaves. In all habitats and in both species, more than 25% of expanding leaves disappeared entirely. Rates of leaf-area loss per week differed among habitats for expanding leaves but not for mature leaves. In a relatively open, 1-y-old logged forest, faster leaf expansion reduced the time leaves spent in the most vulnerable stage; however, in S. leprosula a greater rate of leaf area loss countered the shorter expansion time. Thus, leaves accumulated similar total damages across habitats, and herbivory did not produce differences among habitats in seedling growth or mortality. High levels of resources may increase both leaf palatability and leaf expansion rates, with counteracting effects on herbivory.","Danum Valley; Dipterocarp; Dryobalanops lanceolata; Herbivory rates; Leaf damage; Leaf expansion rates; Logged tropical forests; Secondary forests; Shorea leprosula","Davidson, D.W.; Department of Biology, 257 South, 1400 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112-0840, United States; email: avidson@bioscience.utah.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035104706

This study shows that forest degradation and clearing in Northwest Ecuador between 1983 and 1992 was closely linked to commercial logging. A key finding is that domestic demand is critical for shaping timber extraction and, hence, forest degradation and deforestation in this region. Low timber prices for roundwood and sawnwood at the origin, which are bolstering unsustainable forest extraction, have not been affected by market liberalization. This suggests that conservation initiatives that target international trade linkages may only be partially successful, even when they do what they are intended to do. Results suggest that market-based incentives are more likely to produce the desired results if they target and support timber producers directly. These findings are also relevant for other regions where domestic markets are a significant drive for deforestation and where local markets are supplied through the activities of small-scale, labor-intensive primary producers. Also, by emphasizing areas where logging is a dominant force, meso-level studies, like this one, not only help to more accurately estimate the impact on local forests, but also identify major resource flows and the factors promoting or hindering sustainable use, and those affecting the effectiveness of policy options. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","Domestic markets; Ecuador; Latin America; Timber trade; Tropical deforestation","Sierra, R.; Department of Geography, , Tempe, AZ 85287-0104, United States; email: rsierra@asu.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035133093

Assemblage composition was most similar at logged and unlogged sites. The logged forest herpetofauna had higher species richness and abundance than the unlogged forest, but diversity was greater in the unlogged forest due to greater evenness. In contrast, the pine plantation site had the highest richness, abundance, and evenness of the three study sites, but species composition was distinct from the other areas. Herpetofaunal densities were significantly lower in all three areas during the dry season than in the wet season. During the dry season, soil moisture, litter mass, topography, shrub cover, and number of fallen logs were significant positive predictors of herpetofaunal presence in litter plots, but only soil moisture was significant in the wet season. The interaction of moisture and topography appears to be important in determining seasonal patterns of litter herpetofaunal distribution.

A case study from a subtropical humid forest reserve in Misiones, Argentina is presented to illustrate a ""uniform spacing"" method of forest harvest. In this method, trees are selected for extraction or marked for retention according to their scarcity, their horizontal distribution, and their characteristics to serve as seed trees. Three years after harvesting, the forest cut by uniform spacing had the highest density of seedlings of total as well as commercial species, and it also exhibited high diversity of understory plants other than trees. A case study of a silvicultural experiment carried out by CATIE in Costa Rica is also presented, focusing on the effects of logging and post-harvest silvicultural treatments on forest species richness and composition during the first 6-7 yr following logging and 5 yr following the application of treatments. The forest studied was shown to exhibit marked compositional variation in relation to a topographical gradient after the implementation of the experiment; such β- or ecosystem diversity should be taken into account in all future evaluations of the effect of forest management on plant biodiversity. Post-harvest silvicultural treatments caused an immediate reduction in species-richness ≥ 10 cm dbh in 1.0 ha due to the chance elimination of species represented by one or a small number of individuals in the plots, and may affect overall species composition in the medium term as they are directed to favoring commercial species by decreasing competition from non-commercial species. Species richness declined under both silvicultural treatments, however, no changes of species-richness or composition as a result of silvicultural treatment were evident in the forest understory (individuals 2.5-9.9 cm dbh). The only detectable changes in understory plant biodiversity were caused by the felling and extraction of timber, and these changes were restricted to the very localized areas disturbed by these management operations. The application of low-intensity logging methods with selection of remnant trees requires detailed pre- and post-harvest forest inventories and follow up of treatments to ensure successful regeneration and growth of desired species. The Costa Rican study shows that different forest management operations (logging and silviculture in this case) may have different effects on plant biodiversity; this perspective should be applied to future studies in order to better understand the balance between production and conservation in tropical forests. Long-term follow up is needed to assess the true effects of forest management on biodiversity, including natural regeneration as well as growth dynamics of trees, until a whole harvest cycle is completed.","Biodiversity; Logging; Regeneration; Shelterwood; Silviculture; Uniform spacing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035192119

Evolutionary phenomena such as taxon cycles, acting over much greater time periods, may also influence abundance and promote species extinction. This paper assesses which of a wide range of ecological and historic traits best predict the variation in abundance of tropical forest birds on Sumba and Buru islands in Wallacea (Indonesia). In addition we seek to determine which traits predict species' ability to adapt to secondary or logged forest. The most important correlates of both abundance and ability to transfer were those related to the evolutionary history of the species within the Wallacean Archipelago and not the traits that were more directly related to species ecology. These relationships are maintained when allowance is made for phylogenetic relationships. Our interpretation of the results is that recent colonists to an island are initially rare in the indigenous forest habitat but concomitant with an adaptation to local conditions they gradually become more abundant and taxonomically distinct from other populations of the same species. These results apparently contradict the taxon cycle hypothesis but this may be a result of our focus on indigenous forest habitats rather than on a wider range dominated by anthropogenic ones. © 2001 The Linnean Society of London.","Extinction; Island birds; Logging; Species abundance; Taxon cycles","Jones, M.J.; Department of Biological Sciences, Chester Street, Manchester M1 5GD, United Kingdom; email: m.jones@mmu.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034957701

In this study, we estimated the cost of cutting lianas in 12 plots of 0.25 ha each in a densely liana-infested forest of lowland Bolivia, and evaluated the efficiency of this silvicultural treatment in terms of the proportion of lianas missed, the density of resprouting liana stumps, and the number of liana-infested trees after two years of an experimental liana treatment. The cost of cutting lianas in this forest by locally hired laborers was 23.6 (SE = 2.48) person-hours/ha. Considering local cost of labor and the U.S.-Bolivian currency exchange rate at the time of the study, this figure translates to ca $15/ha. Liana density decreased from 2471 (SE = 104.3) to 130 (SE = 24.2) liana stems ≥2 cm/ha immediately after cutting, because 5.5 percent of lianas were left uncut (missed). Slender lianas were missed more often than lianas with large-diameter stems. Liana species that grow 2-3 m before they start to twine were also frequently missed. Twenty-two percent of liana stumps ≥2 cm sprouted after cutting. Liana stumps with larger diameters sprouted more than stumps with smaller diameters. Most liana stumps produced only two sprouts. Two years after cutting, 78 percent of trees had no living lianas in their crowns, in contrast to only 13 percent liana-free trees in the control plots. Sixtyfour percent of trees still had hanging dead lianas two years after cutting, but only 23 percent of trees were reinvaded by lianas using dead liana stems as trellises. Liana cutting can efficiently reduce the number of lianas in liana-infested forests, and the effects of cutting lianas last for at least two years; however, the treatment is expensive. Thus, we recommend that it is better to view liana cutting as a preventive activity to avoid liana infestation, rather than as a corrective measure after poor management. Liana cutting can be easily conducted along with other reduced-impact logging practices.","Bolivia; Costs; Forest management; Liana cutting; Tropical forests","Pérez-Salicrup, D.R.; Depto. de Ecol. de los Recursos Nat., , C.P. 58089 Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico; email: diego@oikos.unam.mx",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034954490

The biomass and its distribution were studied using standard regression analysis and the clear-cut method for shrubs and herbs. The total biomass was 360.9 t/ha and its allocation in different layers was: tree layer 352.5 t/ha, shrub layer 4.7 t/ha, liana 3.1 t/ha and herb layer 0.5 t/ha. Most of the biomass was concentrated in the trees: stem 241.2 t/ha, root 69.6 t/ha, branch 37.2 t/ha and leaves 4.3 t/ha; The DBH class allocation of the tree biomass was concentrated in the middle DBH class. The biomass of six DBH classes from 20 to 80 cm was 255.4 t/ha. There are twenty-six species with biomass over 0.5% of the total biomass of the tree layer, and three species with biomass over 5%, i.e., Pometia tomentosa, Barringtonia macrostachya (5.4%) and Terminalia myriocarpa (5.2%).

It may also reduce other adverse logging effects. A study of RIL's effects in Sabah, Malaysia, found 44% reduction of area logged within a tract, 22% reduction in timber yield per logged hectare, and 18% increase in cost per m3 logged compared with conventional logging (CL). Estimated timber yield at the next harvest was 31% higher following RIL. Compared with unlogged forest, RIL damaged rattan, wildlife, soil and water quality values less than did CL. However, RIL's environmental benefits per area of forest logged are considerably compromised by the greater logging area required for a given timber yield. Doing RIL in place of CL had a net cost per unit area at all rates of discount. Per m3 of timber logged, RIL was beneficial without discounting, but had a net cost at a 2% discount rate and higher. The overall cost of RIL's superior carbon retention varied with both discount rate and level of analysis, from negative price to more than US$ 50 per megagram at a 10% discount rate.

At a site in the southwestern Central African Republic, we surveyed rodent and tree communities and vegetation structure in unlogged forest and along skid trails and secondary and primary access roads at 12 and 19 years after logging. The most important source of variation among transects was the type of logging road: primary and secondary access roads showed the greatest change and skid trails the least. An intercorrelated suite of changes occurred along the margins of the roads, including changes in rodent community composition, increases in rodent abundance and diversity, changes in the height distribution of rodent abundance, increases in understory foliage density, and decreases in sapling density and tree species richness. Ecological changes along the secondary roads were nearly as strong as those along primary roads, despite the fact that secondary roads had been abandoned immediately after logging, whereas primary roads had been traveled up to the time of the research. Continuing edge-induced effects along graded road margins at between 12 and 19 years after logging were indicated by differences in tree species composition, sapling and tree densities, and understory density. Our results support conclusions of increased disturbance to rainforest communities with increasingly destructive road construction techniques and suggest that canopy damage rather than stem damage is the most appropriate measure of logging damage. Although minimizing the length of access roads is important in reducing ecological effects, it should not be achieved at the expense of increased canopy damage. Rodent communities appear to be an easily measured indicator of these ecological changes and may be responsive to landscape-level changes in forest cover and degradation.",,"Malcolm, J.R.; Faculty of Forestry, 33 Willcocks Street, Toronto, Ont., M5S 3B3, Canada; email: jay.malcolm@utoronto.ca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034503869

We demonstrate how ecology helps us understand forests and forest change and argue an urgent need for a wider appreciation and utilisation of current knowledge. We illustrate how forest managers must take a holistic, long-term landscape-level view, and how change in itself is inevitable. We start by considering familiar concerns relating to silviculture and canopy disturbance. From the basis, we move into the neglected biology of tree pollination and seed dispersal and the risks associated with animal loss. We identify the increasing threats from fire, exotic species, and habitat fragmentation. Finally, we consider the difficult balance between timber production and conservation related values: We then suggest how our ecological overview, with its mixture of common sense and more subtle insights, might be translated into beneficial actions and conclude that considerable progress is attainable, but requires collaboration between ecologists and forest managers. Initiatives that seek to reform forest practices in the tropics require a sound ecological basis to better address the many challenges facing modern forestry in these regions - such a basis is, in large part, already available for wider use. We provide some illustrations as to how management may be improved. Fundamental to these is the recognition that ecological knowledge is crucial to forestry but currently too often ignored, and that considerable and rapid progress is possible if ecologists, foresters, and others can find ways to work together and address this directly.","Biodiversity; Conservation; Education; Landscape ecology; Rainforest; Reduced impact logging; Tropical silviculture","Sheil, D.; Ctr. for Inter.

Situated in the centre of South America, these tropical forests are also some of the most diverse, ranging from wet Amazonian rainforests to dry Chaco woodlands. After decades of light selective logging with little attention to management. Bolivia is now actively promoting sustainable forestry. A new forestry law requires government-approved management plans for all logged forests and Bolivia already has more than a half million hectares of internationally certified production forest. However, several obstacles remain in reconciling current logging practices with forest conservation. While selection logging does not appear to cause immediate damage to biodiversity or forest functioning, research points to gradual degradation of forest economic value in the form of reductions in timber stand quality and regeneration failures of commercial timber species. Their decreased value for timber production may make these forests more prone to conversion to other land uses, such as cattle ranching, agriculture, and human population settlements. Forest managers must address these problems through the application of silvicultural treatments that provide for regeneration of commercial species and maintenance of stand quality. Whether or not these improvements are realized at the stand level. Bolivian forests still face threats from powerful social and economic forces. Because logging roads also provide access for wildlife poachers, timber thieves and squatters and because logged forests are more susceptible to wildfire, forest protection measures will be critical to forest conservation efforts in Bolivia.

They argue that human residents in tropical forests inevitably deplete populations of large animals through hunting, which triggers a chain reaction of ecological events that greatly diminish the conservation value of these forests. Hence, they believe that removal of people from tropical forests is an essential step in the creation of successful parks and in the conservation of nature in the tropics. This approach can lead to undesirable consequences, however. Forest residents - and rural people generally - are potent political actors in tropical forest regions and an essential component of the environmental political constituencies that are necessary for the long-term conservation of tropical forests. In Amazonia and elsewhere, rural people are defending far bigger areas of tropical forest from unfettered deforestation and logging than are parks, thereby conserving the ecological services provided by these forests and the majority of their component plant and animal species. Moreover, the data are too sparse to judge the effects of forest peoples on populations of large forest animals. The establishment of pristine, tropical forest parks is an important conservation goal, but the exclusive pursuit of this goal undermines the broader objectives of conservation when it identifies forest residents and other rural people as the enemies of nature.",,"Schwartzman, S.; Environmental Defense Fund, 1875 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20009, United States; email: sschwartzman@environmentaldefense.org",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033781145

Closed-canopy sites and gaps were selected stratified randomly. In addition, all large natural and felling gaps encountered were sampled. All stems ≤5 cm dbh were sampled in sets of 10 m2 plots in closed-canopy sites and gaps. The origins of the 10 tallest stems in each gap were also determined. Rubber-tired skidder disturbance in felling gaps resulted in a fourfold increase in the relative abundances of a set of shade-intolerant species. The logging process also promoted root sprouting, primarily among shade-intolerant species, but also in several shade-tolerant species. Advance growth accounted for a higher proportion of tall stems in natural than felling gaps and most of these stems were of shade-tolerant species. The proportion of tall stems that originated from seeds or small seedlings at the time of gap formation was higher in felling than natural gaps and increased with canopy openness only in felling gaps. These stems were primarily from shade-intolerant species. A lack of response to canopy openness in natural gaps was likely a result of relatively low levels of understory and substrate disturbance coupled with the absence of large natural gaps with high canopy openness. The maintenance of shade-intolerant and tolerant timber species in this forest would appear to require, at minimum, the creation of large gaps with understory and substrate disturbance within a matrix of forest logged by single-tree selection methods in which understory damage was minimized.

Based on our collective experience with loggers in tropical forests, we discuss seven possible reasons for this seemingly irrational behavior. The principal reason poor logging practices persist is apparently that the widely heralded cost savings associated with reduced-impact logging relative to unplanned logging by untrained crews may not be realized under some conditions. In particular, where compliance with logging guidelines restricts access to steep slopes or prohibits ground-based timber yarding on wet ground, reduced impact logging may be synonymous with reduced-income logging. Given that under such conditions loggers may not adopt reduced-impact logging methods out of self-interest, fiscal mechanisms for promoting sustainable forest management may be needed.",,"Putz, F.E.; Department of Botany, , Gainesville, FL 32611, United States; email: fep@botany.ufl.edu",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033863909

There was a three-fold variation in species richness and abundance over the 8-month sampling period.

Rarefied species richness was positively correlated with canopy openness within the range of disturbance levels encountered at our forest sites. Within families, there was no significant difference in the number of species between primary and logged forest. There was a significant difference in the relative abundance of species, but this was due largely to the abundance of one or two species. Community ordination separated the sites along a gradient of disturbance and revealed strong differences between riverine and ridge-forest butterfly assemblages in primary forest that were obscured in logged forest. There was no evidence that logging has resulted in a change in the composition of the butterfly assemblages from species with a local distribution to more widespread species.

Areas sampled included logging gaps, logging roads, skid trails, and log landings. Areas not disturbed by logging were also sampled as controls. The abundance and composition of competing vegetation in tree regeneration plots was also measured. The highest density and greatest initial height growth rates of tree regeneration were observed on areas with the greatest amount of soil disturbance, including log landings and logging roads. This trend was largely due to the higher densities of two common, light-seeded, shade-intolerant species, Anadenanthera colubrina and Astronium urundeuva. Despite having higher light availability than other sites, tree regeneration of all species was poor in logging gaps. Logging gaps were quickly colonized by competing vegetation, particularly lianas, where they had a percent cover 2.5 times that in undisturbed sites. Regeneration of some commercial species in these forests appears to respond more favorably to disturbances that exceed those provided by single tree selection logging. Despite the better initial establishment and growth of a few species on areas with soil disturbance caused by logging, the lack of regeneration of other commercial tree species and the increasing colonization of all sites by competing plants indicate the need for post-harvest competition control treatments to ensure vigorous commercial species regeneration that will contribute to the sustainable management of this forest.

Skid trails in the reduced-impact logging areas were less severely disturbed than those in conventional logging areas; the proportion of skid trails with subsoil disturbance was less than half that in conventional logging areas. Four years after logging, woody plant recovery on skid trails was greater in areas logged by reduced-impact than by conventional methods. Skid trails where topsoil had been bladed off had less woody vegetation than skid trails with intact topsoil.

As the role of forestry-based options for reducing or mitigating greenhouse gas emissions is debated by policymakers, there is a need to inform the debate by synthesizing existing information on carbon dynamics in tropical forest systems and by applying this information to a range of possible interventions in forestry. 2. To investigate the consequences of reductions in logging damage for ecosystem carbon storage, we constructed a model to simulate changes in biomass and carbon pools following logging of primary dipterocarp forests in south-east Asia. We adapted a physiologically driven tree-based model of natural forest gap dynamics (FORMIX) to simulate forest recovery following logging. 3. Following selective logging, simulated ecosystem carbon storage declined from prelogging levels (213 Mg C ha-1) to a low of 97 Mg C ha-1, 7 years after logging. Carbon storage in biomass approached prelogging levels about 120 years after logging. 4. The relationship between fatal stand damage and ecosystem carbon storage was not linear, with biomass recovery following logging severely limited by 50-60% stand damage. 5. Results from simulations suggest that when 20-50% of the stand is killed during logging, replacing persistent forest species with pioneer tree species can reduce the site's potential for carbon storage by 15-26% over 40-60 years. 6. Reducing fatal damage from 40% to 20% of the residual stand, as was the case with a pilot project in Malaysia, was associated with an increase of 36 Mg C ha-1 in mean carbon storage over 60 years. 7. Efforts to monitor and verify the benefits, either through carbon sequestration in new growth or carbon retention in existing biomass, of offset projects involving tropical forests and natural forest management should focus on above-ground biomass, particularly the large trees. Selection of the most appropriate allometric equations for a site and species is important because of their influence on biomass estimates.","Disturbance; Model; Recovery; Reduced-impact logging; Tropical forest","Pinard, M.A.; Department of Forestry, , Aberdeen AB24 5UA, United Kingdom; email: m.a.pinard@abdn.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034095239

The first is accelerating deforestation and logging. Despite recent government initiatives to slow forest loss, deforestation rates in Brazilian Amazonia have increased from 1.1 million ha yr-1 in the early 1990s, to nearly 1.5 million ha yr-1 from 1992-1994, and to more than 1.9 million ha yr-1 from 1995-1998. Deforestation is also occurring rapidly in some other parts of the Amazon Basin, such as in Bolivia and Ecuador, while industrialized logging is increasing dramatically in the Guianas and central Amazonia. The second phenomenon is that patterns of forest loss and fragmentation are rapidly changing. In recent decades, large- scale deforestation has mainly occurred in the southern and eastern portions of the Amazon - in the Brazilian states of Para, Maranhao, Rondonia, Acre, and Mato Grosso, and in northern Bolivia. While rates of forest loss remain very high in these areas, the development of major new highways is providing direct conduits into the heart of the Amazon. If future trends follow past patterns, land-hungry settlers and loggers may largely bisect the forests of the Amazon Basin. The third phenomenon is that climatic variability is interacting with human land uses, creating additional impacts on forest ecosystems. The 1997/98 El Nino drought, for example, led to a major increase in forest burning, with wildfires raging out of control in the northern Amazonian state of Roraima and other locations. Logging operations, which create labyrinths of roads and tracks in forests, are increasing fuel loads, desiccation and ignition sources in forest interiors. Forest fragmentation also increases fire susceptibility by creating dry, fire-prone forest edges. Finally, recent evidence suggests that intact Amazonian forests are a globally significant carbon sink, quite possibly caused by higher forest growth rates in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 fertilization. Evidence for a carbon sink comes from long-term forest mensuration plots, from whole-forest studies of carbon flux and from investigations of atmospheric CO2 and oxygen isotopes. Unfortunately, intact Amazonian forests are rapidly diminishing. Hence, not only is the destruction of these forests a major source of greenhouse gases, but it is reducing their intrinsic capacity to help buffer the rapid anthropogenic rise in CO2.","Amazon; Brazil; Carbon sink; Climate change; Climatic variability; Deforestation; Forest conservation; Habitat fragmentation; Logging; Tropical forests","Laurance, W.F.; Biol.

In a continually fluctuating sociopolitical world, it is often impossible to protect areas from such conversion until the political environment is suitable to pursue conservation goals, by which time, the forests have often been converted to other uses. This reality suggests a need for inquiry into which primate species can persist after different types of disturbances and how quickly primate communities can recover from disturbance. Here we examine the persistence of primate populations in disturbed habitats by providing a case study of patterns of primate abundance in areas of Kibale National Park (766 km2), Uganda, that have been modified by different types and intensities of human activities, primarily commercial logging and agricultural clearing. Distributional surveys at 24 sites and detailed line-transect censuses at six sites demonstrate that primate populations in Kibale are often high and suggest that patterns of population change associated with disturbance are complex. Analysis of the land use coverage of Kibale reveals that abandoned farms (10.3%) and degraded forest (8.7%) now cover 146 km2. Unfortunately, we do not know what proportion of the farms were established on areas that were forest versus grassland. However, if the areas that are now abandoned farms were all once forested, this means that 79 km2 of forest has been lost. Based on density estimates from nearby sites, this would represent a loss of 52,612 monkeys and 200 chimpanzees. Populations would also have been affected by the degradation of the 66 km2 (8.7%) of forest. These estimates of the potential reductions in the primate populations that could have resulted from forest clearing and degradation illustrate the importance of protecting land. A review of the literature illustrates that the biomass of primates found within Kibale is very high in comparison to other locations and thus illustrates the importance of Kibale to regional conservation.

Now that logging activities are extending into these steeplands, it is essential to understand how the natural rainforest system behaves if any kind of realistic assessment of the effects of such disturbance is to be made. This paper examines the hydrological behaviour of an undisturbed rainforest system on steep topography in the Temburong District of Brunei, north-west Borneo. The physical and hydrological properties of the regolith material are generally typical of tropical residual soils. The regolith has a clay texture and a low dry bulk density beneath a superficial litter/organic horizon. The infiltration capacity of the surface soil was several hundred mm h-1. That of the exposed mineral subsoil was an order of magnitude less, similar to the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K(sat)) of around 180 mm h-1 at a depth of 150 cm. There was no indication that K(sat) reduced with depth except very near the bedrock interface. Soil tensions were measured using a two-dimensional array of tensiometers on a 30°slope. During dry season conditions, infiltrating rain-water contributes to soil moisture, and drying of the soil is dominated by transpiration losses. During wet season conditions, perched water tables quickly develop during heavy rainfall, giving rise to the rapid production of return flow in ephemeral channels. No infiltration excess or saturation overland flow was observed on hillslopes away from channel margins. Subsurface storm flow combined with return flow produce stream flow hydrographs with high peak discharges and very short lag times. Storm event runoff coefficients are estimated to be as high as 40%. It is concluded that the most distinctive feature of the hydrology of this 'steepland rainforest' is the extremely 'flashy' nature of the catchment runoff regime produced by the combination of thin but very permeable regolith on steep slopes.

In practice, the most fragile environments are wilderness areas with the least previous disturbance. Tourism is growing globally, wilderness is shrinking, and more tourism is occurring in wilderness areas. Tourism can help conserve wilderness if it displaces more damaging land uses such as logging, but this is rare. Commonly, tourism benefits from wilderness conservation without contributing to it. Most tourism in wilderness occurs in areas already reserved for conservation. The current unprecedented scale of recreational use creates significant environmental impacts and converts wilderness reserves to recreational playgrounds. Impacts differ enormously for different activities and ecosystems. Noise, weeds and pathogens pose greater risks in tropical forests than alpine herbfield; trampling much lesser. Easy-to-study impacts such as trampling have been quantified experimentally in a range of ecosystems. Hard-to-measure impacts such as disturbance to cryptic fauna, and microbiological impacts on water quality, are little-studied. There are few studies which quantify tourism activity and ecosystem impact with equal precision, and even fewer which measure the effectiveness of visitor management tools in reducing impacts. Most parks use a toolkit of visitor management techniques, including quotas; zoning; permits; restrictions on particular activities and equipment; education and interpretation; and techniques to harden the environment against impacts. Education is cheapest, but its effectiveness is uncertain. Restrictions work, but are politically difficult. Hardening is easiest, but most expensive, and the end of wilderness. It is therefore increasingly urgent to allocate other public lands to the burgeoning nature tourism industry, so that recreation in wilderness can be restricted to minimal-impact activities, and nature tourism can continue to grow in less fragile environments. © 2000 Tourism Recreation Research.",,"Buckley, R.; International Centre for Ecotourism Research, Australia; email: r.buckley@mailbox.gu.edu.au",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979742281

To fill this knowledge gap, the distribution of nutrients in a humid tropical forest located in the Ecological Reserve of Samuel, Rondônia state, was addressed. A total of 474 trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) > 10 cm were mapped at the Ecological Reserve of Samuel, a 20,000-ha area bordering the Samuel Hydroelectric Reservoir, which is located 50 km south of Porto Velho, Rondônia state, Amazon region, Brazil. These individuals belonged to ca 220 species distributed in 41 families. From this total, leaves of 354 trees were collected for chemical compositional analysis; boles of 96 trees and fine branches of 75 trees also were collected. Soil samples were gathered for fertility analysis at two soil depth intervals: 0-50 and 50-100 cm. In general, soils were acidic and very poor in terms of elemental contents. For plants, the highest concentrations of P, K, and Mg were found in leaves and fine branches, and the highest concentration of Ca was in the litter. The lowest nutrient concentration was observed in boles. The nutrient concentrations of leaves collected at Samuel were similar to that found in other terra firme forests of the Amazon region and other tropical forests growing on poor soils. Comparisons of nutrient concentrations among families, genera, and species revealed that only N concentrations were distinct among botanical taxa; the variability found in concentrations of other nutrients were larger and did not reveal any significant differences. Like aboveground biomass, the total nutrient stocks of trees was concentrated in a few large individuals. This fact reveals important implications about the impacts caused by selective logging. Although few trees are cut per hectare in this activity, the effects on the ecosystem structure, due to the loss of nutrients, may be underestimated.","Amazon; Brazil; Nutrients; Rondônia; Tropical forest","Martinelli, L.A.; Centro de Energia Nuclear na Agric., Av.

To investigate how the temporal pattern of seedfall affects dipterocarp seed and seedling survival, in both a logged and a primary lowland tropical forest, we planted Shorea stenoptera Burck seeds in the last three weeks of a 12-wk synchronous dipterocarp seedfall during a major community mast-fruiting event in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. As a result of commercial timber harvest of dipterocarp individuals eight years before, total dipterocarp seed production in the logged site was only 23% of that in the primary forest. At both sites, an average of 35 kg of seed was sown across a large area (≥1 km2) to examine the spatial pattern of seed destruction. During the period in which 'natural' community mast seed was available to predators, 92% and 99% of experimentally sown seed escaped predators in logged and in primary forest, respectively. After regional seed resources were exhausted, nomadic vertebrates (primarily the bearded pig, Sus barbatus) were observed in both forest areas, and all ungerminated seed was destroyed. Seed predators arrived earlier in the logged area, before most experimentally sown seed had germinated, and the logged site experienced greater seed loss to vertebrates than did the primary forest. Because nomadic seed predators were absent during peak fruit fall of naturally occurring communities at both study sites, there was no evidence of local predator satiation. Rather, experimentally sown seed escaped predation because of rapid germination before predator arrival, as opposed to being ignored by satiated predators. Seed escape was more dependent on the late arrival of pigs than on the amount of local seed production. There was no significant spatial autocorrelation of seed predation. All remaining seed at the scale of the experiment (&gt;1 km2) was destroyed by predators. These findings suggest that satiation of nomadic predators occurs at the landscape scale. Postdispersal seed predators caused significantly greater seed destruction in the experimentally sown seed populations than in naturally dispersed, mast-fruiting communities at both sites. In both logged and primary forests, there was significantly greater loss of experimentally sown seed to predation than was found in the entire natural mast-fruiting Shorea community combined (21 spp.). Moreover, a naturally occurring, but late-fruiting, Shorea species also exhibited greater seed losses to predation than did all other species within each mast-fruiting community, and these proportional losses were similar to those observed in the experimentally sown seeds. Seeds that escaped predation and vertebrate herbivory on post-establishment seedlings displayed high survival, indicating that the availability of suitable microsites did not limit recruitment. In the primary forest, 65% of the germinated experimental seed that survived early causes of mortality was alive 40 mo post-planting, which coincided with the next mast-fruiting event. The spatial distribution of these seedlings was modified primarily by the foraging behavior of vertebrate seed predators in the first two weeks post-planting. The influence of vertebrate predation on seed and seedling survival suggests that foraging behavior by terrestrial vertebrate seed predators may cause directional and/or stabilizing selection for synchronous, interspecific supra-annual dipterocarp seed production across forest regions in Kalimantan.","Commercial logging; Dipterocarpaceae; Herbivory; Mast fruiting; Phenology; Predator satiation; Reproductive synchrony; Seed predation; Seedling recruitment; Shorea stenoptera; Stabilizing selection; Sus barbatus","Curran, L.M.; Department of Biology, , Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1048, United States; email: lcurran@umich.edu",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033969878

Accurate estimates of the location, extent and biomass of regenerating tropical forests are needed in order to quantify their contribution to global carbon budgets. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are independent of near-constant tropical cloud cover and have proved useful for locating and mapping the extent of regenerating tropical forests. To estimate the biomass of regenerating tropical forests we need to determine the nature and strength of the relationship between radar backscatter and biomass for different types of regenerating forest. To further investigate this, two extreme forms of regenerating forest were considered; they were block-logged (clear-cut) forest in the Tapajós area of Pará State, Brazil and selectively-logged forest in Southern Cameroon. Biomass was estimated alometrically for 15 plots in Tapajós and 34 plots in Cameroon and was related to L-band backscatter derived from the JERS-1 SAR. The relationship between backscatter and biomass was strong for the Tapajós study area and weak for the Cameroonian study area.

A random sample survey of 648 households was conducted in 54 villages in the HFZ to understand the effect of the crisis and of a 1994 currency devaluation on the practices of small farmers, and the effect of these practices on forest cover change. Three hypotheses were tested concerning: (1) the balance between export crop and food crop production; (2) the degree of market-orientation of food crop production; and (3) the gender division of labour. Among the key results are that: (1) the area of cocoa production has stagnated while that of coffee, plantain and other food crops has tended to increase; (2) food crop production is now more market-oriented; and (3) men are now far more involved in food crop production than in the past. The results corroborate other studies showing that increased deforestation in the HFZ is largely a product of these three factors and also of: increased rural population, partly resulting from urban-rural migration; decline of food imports and corresponding increase in food crop production; decreased government subsidies for agricultural inputs; and increased logging. The study concludes that: (1) macroeconomic instability can lead to unforeseen and grave consequences not only for the well-being of farmers but also for efforts to protect remaining tropical forests; and that (2) crop diversification might be one way to help avert future income shocks to farmers and minimize forest clearing activity.","Cameroon; Farming systems; Forest clearing","Sunderlin, W.D.; Ctr. for Intl.

Even for comparatively well-studied taxa such as Lepidoptera, disturbance has been reported to increase and decrease diversify with approximately equal frequency. Species diversify within landscapes depends on the spatial scale at which communities are sampled, and the effects of disturbance in tropical forests have been studied at a wide range of spatial scales. Yet the question of how disturbance affects diversity at different spatial scales has not been addressed. We reanalyzed data from previous studies to examine the relationship between spatial scale and effects of disturbance on tropical-forest Lepidoptera. Disturbance had opposite effects on diversify at large and small scales: as scale decreased, the probability of a positive effect of disturbance on diversify increased. We also explicitly examined the relationship between spatial scale and the diversify of butterflies in selectively logged and unlogged forest in Maluku Province, Indonesia. Species richness increased with spatial scale in both logged and unlogged forest, but at a significantly faster rate in unlogged forest, whereas species evenness increased with scale in unlogged forest but did not increase with scale in logged forest. These data indicate that the effects of habitat modification on species diversify are heavily scale-dependent. As a result, recorded effects of disturbance were strongly influenced by the spatial scale at which species assemblages were sampled. Future studies need to account for this by explicitly examining the effects of disturbance at a number of different spatial scales.

Selected tree species were abundant, taxonomically not closely related, and different in the shape of leaves, growth form, and size, with heights between 7 and 35 m. Trees were fogged in an old primary forest stand, in an area of secondary forest where selective logging was performed, and in a swamp forest. Eight conspecific trees per forest type were fogged. A total of 29,736 beetles were collected from all trees that could be assigned to 1433 (morpho)-species; 41.6 percent were singletons and 89.6 percent of species were found with less than ten individuals. Abundant beetle taxa included Latridiidae (N = 4093), Chrysomelidae (3952), Staphylinidae (2931), Apioninae (2621), and Curculionidae (2457). Most species-rich groups were Staphylinidae (N = 196 spp.), Curculionidae (189), and Chrysomelidae (148). Abundance increased in the order: primary < secondary < swamp forest. Due to the relatively high dominance of some species in the secondary forest, species richness increased in the order: secondary < primary < swamp forest. Beta diversity measures and factor analysis showed distinct differences among forest types but higher similarity of beetle communities on different tree species within one forest type. The taxonomic distribution of beetles in the secondary forest was more heterogeneous than in the primary forest. Analyses of the data revealed low host specificity even for phytophagous beetles, underlining the importance of habitat structure and chance effects on the spatial distribution of beetles in the canopy of Budongo Forest.","Canopy fogging; Coleoptera; Host plant; Spatial distribution; Specificity; Tropical forest; Uganda","Wagner, T.; Zoologisches Forschungsinstitut, Adenauerallee 160, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; email: th.wagner.zfmk@uni-bonn.de",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033775838

However, there is evidence that watershed disturbance can increase sediment loads and thereby dilute or even eliminate geochemical anomalies that, under natural conditions, result from the preferential concentration of heavy minerals by streams. To investigate this and other factors influencing background and threshold values in rainforest streams, sediments have been collected from disturbed and undisturbed watersheds on the Kuamut Formation in the Danum Valley, Sabah, Malaysia. In the laboratory a &lt;2 mm portion was wet-screened to obtain the abundance of the 0.424-2 mm, 0.212-0.424 mm, 0.053-0.212 mm and -0.053 mm size fractions, and the magnetic 0.053-0.212 mm fraction. Another portion was wet-sieved to obtain the -0.212 mm fraction for analysis by ICP-ES after a total decomposition using HF-HCl-HNO3. Mineralogy of the sediments and heavy mineral concentrates was determined by X-ray diffraction. Results show that although average concentrations of many elements are significantly higher in sediments from unlogged versus logged watersheds, the differences do not simply relate to the effects of logging. Correlation coefficients for the complete data set show two main trends: (1) concentrations of Ca-Mg-Ti-Co-Cr-Sr-V increase with increasing abundance of magnetite; and (2) K-Ba correlate with abundance of fine (&lt;53 μm) sediment. However, a scatterplot of Ti vs K (as geochemical surrogates for magnetite vs fines) shows much more complex relations than indicated by the overall correlations. Most importantly, the Ti-K correlations can be negative or positive depending on which drainage basin the sediments are from. Furthermore, trends in concentration of many trace elements follow the Ti-K trends within individual drainage basins. Insofar as all the streams are on a single geological unit, the presence of distinct linear trends in the scatterplots implies that the composition of the sediments is being systematically modified in a variety of ways. The association between magnetite and Ca-Mg-Ti-Co-Cr-Sr-V (and negative correlation with K-Ba) is best developed in the two largest streams and most likely results from fluvial processes that concentrate heavy minerals and eliminate fines from the stream bed. Conversely, field observations suggest that a trend for Ti-K, together with many other elements, to be positively correlated at low concentrations of Ti depends on whether the sediment source is dominated by bedrock or by regolith supplied from recent mass-wasting events, the frequency of which is increased by logging. It is concluded that selective logging of lowland tropical rainforest does not cause major changes in stream sediment geochemistry except in the vicinity of recent landslides where input of deeply weathered tropical regolith lowers geochemical background. The combined effects of sediment source (landslide regolith versus bedrock) and sedimentological processes on sediment geochemistry can be visualized in X-Y-Z 'process' plots, where X-Y are suitable index elements and Z is the element of interest.

Research into the successional responses of tropical forest communities following disturbance has potential applications for habitat restoration. Currently little is known of how these responses relate to the recovery of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Succession of assemblages of decomposer arthropods is essential for the recovery of the soil community and nutrient cycling processes. 2. This study investigated the successional response of a termite assemblage to the experimental perturbation of forest habitat in southern Cameroon, examining the implications for tropical forest restoration. A randomized block design consisting of four experimental perturbations of differing severity was established in an old secondary forest in the Mbalmayo Forest Reserve. Isolated control sites were left in undisturbed forest. Recovery of the termite assemblage was assessed by measuring termite species richness and abundance at regular intervals over the subsequent 12 months. 3. The speed of recovery of the termite assemblage varied with the type and extent of perturbation. In treatments involving severe soil and canopy disturbance, termite species richness and abundance recovered more rapidly when dead wood was left on the ground following perturbation. The availability of dead wood also resulted in recolonization by a subset of the termite assemblage that was distinct compositionally from that sampled from all other treatments. This subset at sites with additional dead wood included not only certain wood-feeding species, but also soil feeders. 4. The positive effects upon the termite assemblage of leaving substantial dead wood on the ground has implications for the restoration of tropical forests following human-induced disturbances such as logging. The accelerated recovery of termite diversity and assemblage composition is a significant component of soil community recovery and the restoration of nutrient cycles. These benefits are expected to influence soil fertility and, ultimately, forest regeneration. The duration and persistence of these effects will depend crucially on the type, scale and intensity of the original disturbance. The impact of termites on soil properties, and vice versa, clearly deserves more attention in studies of tropical forest regeneration and recovery.","Forest disturbance; Restoration; Succession; Termite diversity","Davies, R.G.; Termite Research Group, Cromwell Road, London SW7 5BD, United Kingdom; email: ricd@nhm.ac.uk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033394674

Risks to biodiversity in Amazonian forests include deforestation, logging, fires, fragmentation, depletion of fauna, invasion by exotic species, and climate change. Financial values assigned to biodiversity depend strongly on the purposes of valuation. Utilitarian benefits include the values of presently-marketed and presently-unexploited forest products, and the monetary value of environmental benefits. Non-monetary values of Amazonian forests are also essential components of decision-making on conservation. Measures of 'willingness to pay' and 'willingness to accept' can be useful as indicators of potential financial flows, but should not be confused with the true values of the forests to society. Valuation for the purpose of setting penalties for destruction of biodiversity is an important legal question in Brazil and must take into consideration additional factors. Conservation of biodiversity in Brazil includes creation of various types of protected areas. The status of these areas varies greatly, with practice frequently deviating from official requirements. Creating reserves that include human occupants has a variety of pros and cons. Although the effect of humans is not always benign, much larger areas can be brought under protection regimes if human occupants are included. Additional considerations apply to buffer zones around protected areas. The choice and design of reserves depends on the financial costs and biodiversity benefits of different strategies. In Brazil, rapid creation of lightly-protected 'paper parks' has been a means of keeping ahead of the advance of barriers to establishment of new conservation units, but emphasis must eventually shift to better protection of existing reserves. Indigenous peoples have the best record of maintaining forest, but negotiation with these peoples is essential in order to ensure maintenance of the large areas of forest they inhabit. The benefits of environmental services provided by the forest must accrue to those who maintain these forests. Development of mechanisms to capture the value of these services will be a key factor affecting the longterm prospects of Amazonian forests. However, many effective measures to discourage deforestation could be taken immediately through government action, including levying and collecting taxes that discourage land speculation, changing land tenure establishment procedures so as not to reward deforestation, revoking remaining incentives, restricting road building and improvement, strengthening requirements for environmental impact statements (RIMAs) for proposed development projects, and creating employment alternatives.","Amazonia; Biodiversity; Conservation; Deforestation; Rainforest; Tropical forests; Valuation","Fearnside, P.M.; National Institute Research Amazon, CP 478, 69011-970 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; email: pmfearni@inpa.gov.br",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033367332

Approximately 10% of species were confined to primary forest across a range of species' abundances, suggesting this is a minimum estimate for the number of species lost following logging.

Recent appreciation of the impact of parameter uncertainty on the statistical credibility of complex models with little internal state validation supports the use of more parsimonious approaches such as data-based mechanistic (DBM) modelling. The DBM approach combines physically based understanding with model structure identification based on transfer functions and objective statistical inference. Within this study, these approaches have been newly applied to rainfall-SSflux response. The dynamics of the sediment system, together with the rainfall-river flow system, were monitored at five nested contributory areas within a 44 ha headwater region in Malaysian Borneo. The data series analysed covered a whole year at a 5 min resolution, and were collected during a period some five to six years after selective timber harvesting had ceased. Physically based and statistical interpretation of these data was possible given the wealth of contemporary and past hydrogeomorphic data collected within the same region. The results indicated that parsimonious, three-parameter models of rainfall-river flow and rainfall-SSflux for the whole catchment describe 80 and 90% of the variance, respectively, and that parameter changes between scales could be explained in physically meaningful terms. Indeed, the modelling indicated some new conceptual descriptions of the river flow and sediment-generation systems. An extreme rainstorm having a 10-20 year return period was present within the data series and was shown to generate new mass movements along the forestry roads that had a differential impact on the monitored contributory areas. Critically, this spatially discrete behaviour was captured by the modelling and may indicate the potential use of DBM approaches for (i) predicting the differential effect of alternative forestry practices, (ii) estimating uncertainty in the behaviour of ungauged areas and (iii) forecasting river flow and SSflux in terrain with temporal changes in rainfall regime and forestry impacts.","Erosion; Hydrology; Modelling; Suspended sediment; Transfer function; Tropical forestry","Chappell, N.A.; Ctr. for Res. on Envtl.

The 1.5 km2 undisturbed forest control catchment experienced a complete drying out of the stream for the whole 1.5 km of defined channel above the gauging station in 1992, but concentrated surface flow along every declivity from within a few metres of the catchment divide after the exceptional rains of 19 January 1996. Under these natural conditions, erosion is episodic. Sediment is discharged in pulses caused by storm events, collapse of debris dams and occasional landslips. Disturbance by logging accentuates this irregular regime. In the first few months following disturbance, a wave of sediment is moved by each storm, but over subsequent years, rare events scour sediment from bare areas, gullies and channel deposits. The spatial distribution of sediment sources changes with time after logging, as bare areas on slopes are revegetated and small gullies are filled with debris. Extreme storm events, as in January 1996, cause logging roads to collapse, with landslides leading to surges of sediment into channels, reactivating the pulsed sediment delivery by every storm that happened immediately after logging. These effects are not dampened out with increasing catchment scale. Even the 721 km2 Sungai Segama has a sediment yield regime dominated by extreme events, the sediment yield in that single day on 19 January 1996 exceeding the annual sediment load in several previous years. In a large disturbed catchment, such road failures and logging-activity-induced mass movements increase the mud and silt in floodwaters affecting settlements downstream. Management systems require long-term sediment reduction strategies. This implies careful road design and good water movement regulation and erosion control throughout the logging process.","Erosion; Extreme events; Landslides; Logging impacts; Sediment transport; Tropical hydrology","Douglas, I.; School of Geography, , Manchester M13 9PL, United Kingdom",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033615983

Critics of active forest management overestimate problems and underestimate human capacity to solve them. They isolate parts of a complex issue, i.e. the biodiversity component of tropical forest management, to generalize about the negatives of logging. This view of the tropics is consistent with past treatment of tropical issues by those that evaluate the situation from a non-tropical perspective. The literature reveals that conservation of biodiversity can be compatible with measured use of tropical forests.

Results from the growing corpus of quantitative studies show that: a) bushmeat remains the primarY source of animal protein for the majority of Congo Basin families; b) bushmeat hunting can constitute a significant source of revenue for forest families; c) bushmeat consumption by low density populations living in the forest may be sustainable at present; d) demand for bushmeat by growing numbers of urban consumers has created a substantial market for bushmeat that is resulting in a halo of defaunation around population centres, and may be driving unsustainable levels of hunting, even in relatively isolated regions; and e) large bodied animals with low reproductive rates are most susceptible to over-exploitation compared with more r-selected species that apparently can tolerate relatively intensive hunting (Mangel et al. 1996). As urban populations continue to grow and economies revitalise, unless action is taken to alter the demand for, and the supply of bushmeat, the forests of the Congo Basin will be progressively stripped of certain wildlife species, risking their extirpation or extinction, and the loss of values they confer to local economies. Consequently, it is essential that a) logging companies are encouraged or coerced not to facilitate bushmeat hunting and transportation in their concessions, b) we develop a better understanding of the elasticity of bushmeat demand, c) that pilot bushmeat substitution projects are supported and their impact on demand evaluated, and d) social marketing activities are put in place to attempt to direct consumer preferences for animal protein away from bushmeat species that are particularly susceptible to over-exploitation.","Bushmeat; Central Africa; Conservation; Hunting; Tropical forest; Wildlife","Wilkie, D.S.18 Clark Lane, Waltham, MA 02451-1823, United States; email: dwilkie@email.msn.com",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032809192

A principal components analysis extracted two factors related to forest density and tree size that were also significantly higher in unlogged forest. However, there was significant spatial heterogeneity in vegetation structure within logged forest. 3. In undisturbed forest, a logistic regression model identified suitable habitat for R. makuta as areas of less dense forest close to streams. There were no differences between logged and unlogged habitats in spatial distribution and abundance of R. makuta. Availability of suitable habitat and habitat requirements of butterflies also did not differ between habitats. There was, however, significant heterogeneity in butterfly abundance within logged forest, corresponding with availability of suitable habitat. 4. Fieldwork in 1997 coincided with a severe drought on Borneo, and butterfly spatial distribution and abundance were significantly reduced compared with a year of more normal rainfall (1996); populations in 1997 contracted to areas around streams and to areas with high cover of host-plant. 5.

To do this we construct a small optimal control theory model within an integrated framework including both the biological and the economic implications of timber extraction. The approach uses detailed stock, yield and cost data from Ghana. A numerical solution is reached by the use of multi-period non-linear optimisation. Direct subsidies to low-impact logging activities through area-dependent subsidies is found to be far more efficient than subsidising prices of tropical timber. The model takes a novel approach in combining growth and stock in a tropical forest area with the cost and damage connected with timber extraction. It allows us to analyse the interactions between stock, growth, timber extraction, logging damage and operating costs in an integrated manner.","Ghana; Incentives; Low-impact logging; Sustainability; Tropical forest","Bach, C.F.; Institute of Economics, Studiestroede 6, DK-1455 Copenhagen K, Denmark; email: cfb@econ.ku.dk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032857603

Similar surveys were carried out during road construction and 15 years later within 5km of the road and were also compared with the undisturbed bird community of a nearby primary forest. The main disturbance was the change in forest structure brought about by logging and secondarily the road opening, the roadside second growth and the depletion of large vertebrates by hunting pressure. The responses of different bird guilds were highly divergent according to their natural habitat requirements, their diet and their vulnerability to hunting. They resulted in a moderate decrease in overall species richness and equitability. All species pooled, the abundance of 118 species was lowered, that of 45 species did not change appreciably and 89 were favored or even appeared. The guilds most affected were those with large body sizes, from terrestrial foragers to canopy frugivores, mostly by hunting, and the open understorey specialists, notably large insectivores and mixed flock members, because of changes in forest structure after logging. The guilds favored by logging and road opening were many of the hummingbirds, upper canopy frugivores and omnivores, and gap, edge or low secondary growth specialists. Recommendations to minimize the negative consequences of human exploitation in rain forests include reducing the width of deforested roadsides to no more than 10-15 m on either side, implementing much more careful logging practices and StrOngly limiting hunting pressure in newly opened areas.","Bird; Community; Disturbance; Logging; Tropical forest","Thiollay, J.-M.; Laboratoire d'Ecologie, 46, rue d'Ulm, 75230 Paris Cedex 05, France; email: thiollay@biologie.ens.fr",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032995038

Terrestrial ('free-standing') and hemi-epiphytic ('strangler') fig tree densities varied among four forests sampled (gallery, dry, sub-humid, and floodplain forests) from 0-3,3 to 1.6-6.7 trees/ha, respectively. However, only the sub-humid forest had significant densities of well-formed free-standing figs suitable for harvesting, out of which only 26% of the total density of mature free-standing figs were of commercial grade quality. Because of the scarcity of well-formed fig trees, the elimination of fig tree populations from these forests by overharvesting is unlikely. However, the elimination of well-formed individuals of species by over-harvesting is possible. Fig seedling and sapling density was low in all forest types, but was highest in areas with increased light and soil disturbance. Thus, while harvesting may reduce the density of mature fig trees available for wildlife, it may also create improved conditions for regeneration. Also, wildlife use of figs was not measured here, figs appear to play an important role in sustaining wildlife in these forests because of the scarcity of other tree species with fleshy fruits in all forest types at the end of the rainy season (April-May). While this study suggests that harvesting rates are not high enough to seriously jeopardize food availability for wildlife, it will be important to more closely define permissible harvesting levels for fig tree species that do not significantly impact frugivorous wildlife species.","Bolivia; Ficus; Figs; Logging; Sustainability; Tropical forests; Wildlife","Fredericksen, T.S.; Proyecto BOLFOR, Casilla 6204, Santa Cruz, Bolivia; email: nelltodd@bibosi.scz.entelnet.bo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033548871

Brazil has a special place in strategies for combating global warming because its vast areas of tropical forest represent a potentially large source of emissions if deforested. A number of issues need to be settled to properly assign credit for carbon in the types of options presented by the Brazilian forest sector. These include definition of the units of carbon (permanent sequestration versus carbon-ton-years, the latter being most appropriate for forest options), the means of crediting forest reserve establishment, adoption of discounting or other time-preference weighting for carbon, definition of the accounting method (avoided emissions versus stock maintenance), and mechanisms to allow program contributions to be counted, rather than restricting consideration to free-standing projects. Silvicultural plantations offer opportunities for carbon benefits, but these depend heavily on the end use of the products. Plantations for charcoal have the greatest carbon benefits, but have high social impacts in the Brazilian context. Plantations also inherently compete with deforestation reduction options for funds. Forest management has been proposed as a global warming response option, but the assignment of any value to time makes this unattractive in terms of carbon benefits. However, reduced-impact logging can substantially reduce emissions over those from traditional logging practices. Slowing deforestation is the major opportunity offered by Brazil. Slowing deforestation will require understanding its causes and creating functional models capable of generating land-use change scenarios with and without different policy changes and other activities. Brazil already has a number of programs designed to slow deforestation, but the continued rapid loss of forest highlights the vast gulf that exists between the magnitude of the problem and the efforts to address it. The ups and downs of Brazil's deforestation rate have so far had little to do with deliberate programs to control or influence the process. Achieving this control will require a major effort in which contributions from the private sector will be needed.

The Forest Service, in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service, is studying climatic, edaphic, and biotic limitations in the reforestation of grassland and savanna in the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, island of Hawaii. Frost damage has been implicated in poor survival of Acacia koa, a dominant native nitrogen fixing tree, and other endemic plants. Data showed that for some years freezing temperatures were common above 1800 m elevation, and that A. koa seedling survival was poorest on micro-topographic sites where freezing temperatures were lowest and most prolonged. Artificial frost protection devices enhanced A. koa seedling survival, presumably by reducing radiative cooling. A similar reduction in radiative cooling was observed under a stand of 4 m tall A. koa. Such stands also changed soil chemical properties, making them intermediate between those of grassland and forest. Light levels near the ground under A. koa were similar to those found in forests, but not as low as those found under pasture grasses. Biomass and nutrient pools of the litter-herbaceous layer were affected by micro-topographic position in the landscape and by the presence of stands of A. koa.

We used this classification to identify a management system appropriate for the commercial species and to evaluate the compatibility of the system with the regeneration requirements of tree species that produce important food for mammalian wildlife.

Land use change is a product of varied local and regional resource use policies. Management of forest resources is one such major temporal factor, influencing resource stability and the carbon pool. Under a given management policy, both the long period of forest growth, and the slow turnover and decay of the carbon pool, enhance the relevance of stand level management policies as cost-effective mechanisms mitigating climate change.

This study focused on the role of resprouting, both as root suckers and above-ground sprouts in comparison to seed regeneration (plants 30-130 cm tall), under different disturbance regimes, pattern with successional age and importance in mature forest. Differently aged forest fallows, a fire-degraded stand (Paraguay), differently aged logged stands (Venezuela) and mature forest in both sites were selected. In Paraguay, the percentage of resprouts declined from 76% in the young forest fallows (2-5-y old) to 48 and 14%, respectively, in the older forest fallows (10 and 15-y old) and mature forest. In Venezuela, by contrast, the proportion of resprouts from the youngest logged stand (5-y old) to the oldest logged stand (19-y old) and mature forest slightly increased from 10 to 16% and 17%, respectively. Root suckers were more common than above-ground sprouts in any of the sampled stands. In forest fallows, 38% of all species possessed both modes of regeneration, while 20 and 18%, respectively, were either found with above-ground sprouts or root suckers. In the fire-degraded stand, most resprouting species were observed with root suckers (28%), whereas species represented with either above-ground sprouts or both modes of vegetative regeneration were less common (7 and 14%, respectively). In logged stands, species reproducing by both means of vegetative regeneration were more frequent (20%) than the other groups (14 and 8%, respectively). In the mature stands in Paraguay and Venezuela, 42 and 14% of the species, respectively, were found with either or both modes of vegetative regeneration. In both sites, significant differences in the ability to resprout between growth forms were found. Of 301 resprouting individuals in Paraguay, 114 were found to be uncut stems, of these 108 produced root suckers and six above-ground sprouts.","Disturbance; Growth forms; Neotropical forests; Succession; Vegetative regeneration","Kammesheidt, L.; Institut fur Waldbau, Abt.

Often people take the view that if you look after the vegetation and vertebrates, the insects will look after themselves. This may be true for some functional groups, but for saproxylic insects, this seems unlikely. Their study deserves high priority, since they are dependent on the very resource - wood - whose removal from the ecosystem is the usual object of forest management. Given the current international effort to develop 'criteria and indicators' to monitor sustainable forest management for biodiversity values, there is a window of opportunity for sound ecological research on saproxylic insects to influence the formulation of forest policy such that their needs can be taken into account. There is already a large body of knowledge on temperate and boreal region saproxylic insects, and on the effects that logging has on them, but knowledge of the tropical forest situation lags far behind. This paper proposes a research agenda to enable the needs of saproxylic insects to be taken into account in natural forest management in the tropics. Basic questions, such as whether logging has so far had an impact on tropical saproxylic insects, and whether there are workable sampling techniques to investigate this, still remain to be addressed and deserve high priority. The links between the responses of saproxylic insects and more 'charismatic' study species need to be investigated. We also need to know whether there is a correlation between the intensity of logging and the response of saproxylic insects, and, critically, whether we would be justified in measuring some surrogate aspects of forest structure (as potential habitat for saproxylic insects) rather than the saproxylic insects themselves, and modelling this to determine likely impacts of different management regimes. We consider such an ambitious research agenda as justified given the scale of impact that forest use and management is likely to have on tropical forest insects in the future.","Indicators; Logging; Rapid biodiversity assessment; Saproxylic insects; Tropical forests","Grove, S.J.; Cooperative Research Centre, PO Box 6811, Cairns, QLD 4870, Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032756990

No inbreeding was detected in saplings or adult cohorts, but the allelic richness was lower in the sapling cohort of the isolated fragment. Genetic distances, Nei's D and (δμ)2, and R(ST) values among saplings were greater than among adult cohorts, suggesting restriction of gene flow due to deforestation and habitat fragmentation.

The results of the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and other long-term surveys show that the populations of most species of grassland and shrubland specialists have declined during the past 25 years. These declines are primarily due to land-use changes, particularly the growth of forest on abandoned farmland and pasture, and the intensification of agriculture on the remaining farmland. Many grassland and shrubland bird species are dependent on ephemeral habitats that quickly become unsuitable due to vegetation change. Only continual disturbance, such as fire, mowing, grazing, or logging, will maintain habitats for these species. Populations of forest migrants have also declined at particular sites, but the evidence for overall population declines throughout eastern North America is not conclusive. Results of the BBS indicate, in fact, that populations of most species of forest migrants have shown an overall increase during the past 25 years. Long-term trends are difficult to discern, however, because the abundance of forest migrants has fluctuated greatly, generally increasing between 1966 and 1979, and decreasing after 1978. Regardless of past trends in populations of forest migrants, there is cause for concern for their future. Both the breeding habitat (large areas of uninterrupted forest) and winter habitat (tropical forests and other natural or seminatural tropical habitats) needed by many species of forest migrants are threatened with degradation or destruction. The future of both early-succession and forest birds depends on careful management of regional landscapes to maintain a diversity of habitat types, with relatively large areas of continuous grassland, shrubland, and forest.",,"Askins, R.A.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032636265

We argue that setting aside protection areas in managed forests as a way to preserve ecological processes may not be sufficient to ensure sustainable levels of tree regeneration, and that a thorough understanding and application of tree seed ecology can help to refine management prescriptions. We review relevant aspects of tree reproductive biology, seed production and dispersal, spatial and temporal constraints on seed availability, disperser behavior, and the potential consequences of hunting and forest fragmentation on tree regeneration, and discuss their implications for biological sustainability in managed forests. Tree seed production can be influenced by the selective removal of neighbors of the same species (due to insufficient pollen transfer), flowering asynchrony, and attributes of the species' sexual system. The extent to which an area is supplied by seed can be affected by dispersal mechanism (spatio-temporal limitations to seed dispersal, and tree size-dependent levels of seed production at the species level. Studies of vertebrate-disperser behavior and tree seed deposition in logged forests are scarce and warrant further attention in order to refine our understanding of the dependency of sustained timber production on vertebrate fauna. Although much remains to be learned about tree seed ecology in neotropical logged forests, the baseline information presented here may offer a starting point for developing ecological criteria for seed tree retention. Furthermore, it may contribute in improving ecologically-based management prescriptions in order to enhance or at least maintain sufficient levels of natural regeneration without the need to rely on artificial regeneration.","Hunting; Logging; Natural forest management; Neotropics; Phenology; Pollination; Seed dispersal; Seed trees; Tropical forest","Guariguata, M.R.; Ctr. for International Forestry Res., P.O.

Instead of evaluating the success or failure of harvests by their selectivity or temporary maintenance of canopy cover, it would be more appropriate to evaluate the success of harvesting based on measurable standards of sustainability.

The relationships are then solved by a cross-correlation equation using simple formulae in the form of triangle-square equations to calculate water and sediment yields between each sample time. The technique is applied to a 51 month data set from a long-term monitoring programme assessing the impacts of commercial logging operations in Sabah, East Malaysia. Yields for the monitoring period derived by the spreadsheet technique are compared with results from the application of more traditional discharge-sediment rating techniques. In the undisturbed catchment, yields derived from some rating equations compare favourably with the spreadsheet technique. However, in the disturbed catchment, rating techniques proved less applicable because of the continuously changing nature of the catchment in relation to vegetation recovery, exacerbating variation and scatter in the data set. The application of the spreadsheet technique provides detailed information at an individual storm level; however, working with the method on long-term discharge records requires a significant commitment of time as compared to the straightforward application of rating equations.","Spreadsheet analysis; Storm hydrograph; Suspended sediment yields; Tropical forest disturbance","Greer, T.; Department of Geography, 10 Kent Ridge Crescent, Singapore 119260, Singapore; email: geoag@nus.edu.sg",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032416358

In the unlogged plot, advective energy accounted for 0.38 mm h-1 of the 0.51 mm h-1 of evaporation, whereas radiative energy accounted for only 0.13 mm h-1.

The concurrent use of these two butterfly censusing techniques, revealed major but conflicting differences in species accumulation rates under different disturbance conditions. The disturbed evergreen habitat had the significantly highest accumulation rate from walk-and-count data but the significantly lowest from fruit trap data. This reflects the specificity of much of the fruit-feeding guild for closed canopy forest. Disturbed habitats were found to lack a distinct canopy fauna. These results are discussed in light of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Within a region of forest, butterflies were found to be more characteristic of a disturbance level than of a particular forest type, lending weight to the belief that butterfly faunas can be used as bioindicators of forest disturbance. Several restricted geographic range species were not adversely affected by forest disturbance, at these levels of disturbance. The butterfly censuses in this study suggest that the optimal strategy for safeguarding butterfly species richness under natural forest management regimes would be to maintain a mosaic of habitats that included areas of undisturbed primary forest and a network of other forest patches, that varied in management regime and level of disturbance.","Butterflies; Conservation; Disturbance; Selective logging; Tropical forest","Wood, B.; Ecology and Conservation Res.

The paper describes the impact of logging on the radiation environment, dipterocarp seedling growth and mycorrhizal dynamics and assesses the impact of logging on the forest as managed under the Indonesian Selective Cutting and Replanting system (TPTI). The study concludes that soil disturbance associated with the logging operation is the main factor limiting seedling establishment and regeneration. The creation of skid trails is associated with removal of the upper soil layers and the pool of shade-suppressed dipterocarp seedlings. The distance to seed sources limits establishment of new seedlings in large gaps following logging. In relation to improving sustainable management of dipterocarp forests, it is suggested that great care should be taken to apply reduced impact logging techniques to protect the soil and dipterocarp seedlings and mycorrhizal fungi. Logging systems can be modified to maximise the regrowth rate of dipterocarp species while inhibiting that of less valuable pioneer species by limiting the size of individual canopy gaps formed by logging so that their projected ground area does not exceed 650 m2. This implies felling no more than two trees per gap.","Canopy gap; Dipterocarp forestry; Indonesia; Logging impacts; Mycorrhizas; Seedling demography","Van Gardingen, P.R.; Institute of Ecology and Resource Management, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, United Kingdom; email: p.vangardingen@ed.ac.uk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031687828

Laos - which is one of the poorest countries in the world but with a forest cover of still over 40% - is a good example for the ongoing deforestation processes in mainland SouthEast Asia. Beside the shifting cultivation which is practised by two thirds of the Laotian population, forests are cleared for national developement purposes. Timber is exported to Thailand to get foreign earnings. In the context of subregional cooperation about ten hydropower dams are under construction which will affect the forests in the interior parts of the country.

Tree saplings and free-standing lianas were similar in almost all of the parameters compared.

Trees and lianas also suffered similar frequencies of damage and mortality after bulldozer passage. Only the elastic resilience of tree saplings and free-standing lianas differed; tree saplings were slightly more resilient than free-standing lianas. These results suggest that the susceptibility and response of tree saplings and free-standing lianas to mechanical damage is similar. An increase in the density of lianas relative to trees was not observed in surviving vegetation on skid trails. This result suggests that liana tangles frequently encountered in selectively logged tropical forest are not the result of differential survival of trees and lianas.","Disturbance; Flexibility; Lianas; Malaysia; Regeneration; Resprouting; Selective logging; Wood anatomy","Kennard, D.K.; Department of Botany, , Gainesville, FL 32611, United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032559817

The area of vegetation damaged by logging was a quadratic increasing function of harvest intensity. This was because at higher harvest intensities, skidders used existing trails for log extraction, and trees tended to fall at least partially on existing gaps, so per tree damage declined with increasing harvest. The median distance of residual forest to the nearest gap after logging decreased from 24.9 m at 1 tree ha-1, to 8.3 m at 6 trees ha-1. Both harvest mortality and total mortality (harvest plus damage to the residual stand) were quadratic increasing functions of harvest intensity when expressed in terms of basal area. Residual basal area damage was a very low because mortality was concentrated on the smaller size classes, which individually contribute little to total basal area. Of three commercial species surveyed, only the seedlings and saplings of Hura crepitans showed a significant positive relationship between relative growth rate and harvest intensity. Finally, tree species loss was relatively low and constant across a range of plot sizes and harvest intensities, but reductions in species diversity (H') depended on the intensity of harvest and plot size.","Bolivia; Harvest rate; Logging damage; Timber extraction; Tropical forestry","Gullison, R.E.3651 Jingle Pot Rd., Nanaimo, BC V9R 5K3, Canada; email: t.gullison@ic.ac.uk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032559791

This study examined three aspects of gap-phase regeneration in selectively logged lowland swamp forest of northeast Costa Rica. First, logging gaps were censused immediately after extraction to determine the density of advanced regeneration. Stem density and basal area of residual trees ≤10 cm dbh in logging gaps was >85% lower than undisturbed forest, and all trees in gaps had sustained structural damage. The common canopy species Pentaclethra macroloba (Fabaceae) was the most abundant species in gaps whereas the timber tree Carapa nicaraguensis (Meliaceae) was absent from all censused gaps. This suggests that canopy replacement, particularly by Carapa, will depend on trees < 10 cm dbh or by seed input into logging gaps. Second, the diversity of the understorey was compared with 6-y old single-tree and multiple-tree logging gaps. Multiple-tree logging gaps were the most diverse, but dominated by two ruderal species; however many shade-tolerant species were present in those gaps. This indicates that controlled selective logging can result in a localized shift in species composition, but that logging gaps should return to pre-logging composition with time under a carefully implemented, controlled harvesting regime. Finally, this study found a significant effect of a fringing Carapa tree on logging gap seedling density. Thus, seed arrival into gaps is a barrier to logging gap regeneration, particularly for a large-seeded tree species. Gap-phase regeneration by a large-seeded tree species in managed forest would benefit from seed broadcasting into gaps.","Carapa nicaraguensis; Forest management; Gaps; Tropical forestry","Webb, E.L.; Dept. of Marine/Wildlife Resources, P.O.

These rates, particularly for N and P, are among the lowest recorded for tropical forests. There were no consistent between-site differences in total nutrient accessions in small litterfall. In terms of the contribution of litterfall to the accessions of nutrients to the forest floor, this suggests that the logged sites have recovered from the effects of selective harvesting within 25 y. Nutrient accessions at each site were distinctly seasonal, with maximum accessions occurring in the late dry season to late in the wet season. Leaf-fall accounted for the largest proportion of nutrient accessions over the study period, although at certain times accessions in both reproductive material and wood were significant. A cyclone which crossed the coast near the study sites resulted in large nutrient accessions over a short period but had little effect on the total annual accession. A comparison with previous studies of litterfall in Australian tropical rainforests indicates that nutrient return in litterfall is directly related to soil fertility.","Australia; Cyclonic effects; Disturbance; Litterfall; North Queensland; Nutrient accessions; Nutrient content; Rain forest; Selective logging","Herbohn, J.L.; Department of Accounting and Finance, , Townsville, QLD 4811, Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031925755

Post-harvest surveys of a spectrum of tropical forests indicate a range of logging effects from local extirpation to substantial increases in local densities of some species. The state of our knowledge does not permit quantitative predictions, but logging at any level appears to have simplifying and homogenizing effects on tropical forest diversity when examined at community or regional scales.

This article examines the impact of the globalisation of environmentalism - including the globalisation of environmental ideas and attitudes, international agreements and institutions, international and local non-governmental organisations, and environmental sections within states - on commercial tropical timber management in the Asia-Pacific. It argues that the environmental rhetoric surrounding forest management has shifted. This has contributed to some government policy reforms. However, few conrete changes to logging practices have occurred in areas that still retain large commercial forests, and loggers continue to rigger widespread deforestation. Global environmental norms and pressures for environmental reforms from non-governmental organisations, state agencies, and communities have had little impact on three key factors that drive unsustainable tropical logging: multinational and domestic timber corporations; international trade and corporate traders; and state management and willingness to manage forest resources. This has occurred partially because of direct opposition from these forces, partially because of the inherent weaknesses of environmental reformers in the Asia-Pacific, and partially because of the complexity of how these forces undermine sustainable commercial timber management. This suggests that even if current efforts to develop a global forests environmental laws and non-governmental groups gain influence, genuine reforms will still occur slowly, perhaps too slowly to save the remaining old-growth tropical forests of the Asia-Pacific.",,"Dauvergne, P.; Dept. of Gov't. and Public Admin., Merewether Building, 1104, NSW 2006, Australia; email: peterd@bullwinkle.econ.usyd.edu.au",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032465388

Surface soil (10 cm deep, 4.7 cm diameter) was collected at 10 m intervals along three 120-160 m long transects in each stand (44-48 soil cores, 22-24 combined seed bank samples per site). Seed density was highest but variable in second-growth stands (8331-1435 seeds/m2), low and homogeneous in old-growth stands (2258-2659 seeds/m2), and intermeidate and highly variable in selectively-logged stands (1165-6954 seeds/m2), which also had contrasting logging intensities. Species richness was strongly dependent on seed density, but showed less variation. Life form distribution did not differ statistically among or within land-use categories. In each stand, herbs-forbs, shrubs, and vines dominated the seed bank (&gt;75% of the species richness and abundance), whereas trees were a minor component (&lt;20% of the species richness and &lt;5% of the abundance) and were predominantly early successional. Shrubs and vines were most abundant in second-growth stands where regrowth vegetation was repeatedly cut before abandonment, whereas grasses and sedges were most abundant in the only forest stand that was completely surrounded by pastures. In terms of species composition, old-growth stands were more similar to selectively-logged stands than to second-growth stands, but across stands, selectively-logged forests were most distinct from the other two forest types. An inventory of the standing woody vegetation in each site showed little representation of the woody taxa found in the seed bank.

Human activities that influence either primate seed dispersal or fruit production have the potential of having unanticipated effects on the other interactants. Here we evaluate what is known and what we still need to learn to evaluate the long-term consequences of disrupting the interactions between primates and tropical forest trees. We do this by first assessing the potential importance of primates at dispersing the seeds of tropical forest trees. Second, we consider possible consequences of hunting primates on recruitment in tropical tree communities. Third, we address the converse by considering the impacts of decreasing resource availability for primates through either logging or through the extraction of nontimber forest products. Finally, we provide a case study from Kibale National Park, Uganda, that contrasts seedling recruitment in 20 forest fragments in which primate seed dispersers have been dramatically reduced with seedling recruitment in areas that have an intact frugivore community. In comparison to the intact forest, the fragments had lower seedling density and fewer species of seedlings. Furthermore, a greater proportion of the seedlings were from small-seeded species that might not require primates for their dispersal, since they probably can be dispersed by small birds. All of these considerations suggest that disrupting the complex interactions between primates and fruiting trees can potentially have negative and possibly cascading effects on ecosystem processes.","Extractive reserves; Hunting; Kibale National Park; Seed dispersal; Seedling recruitment; Timber harvest; Uganda","Chapman, C.A.; Department of Zoology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, United States; email: cachapman@zoo.ufl.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031967601

Although the government has now formally abandoned that policy in response to the growing public awareness of environmental and economic effects of deforestation, it has not been successful in controlling the destruction of forests, owing primarily to the policy of allotting degraded forests to private entrepreneurs and spontaneous resettlers, the open access status of forests, poor public participation in forest management, and very weak management capabilities of local forestry agencies.

In this context simulation models for growth of tropical forest can be a useful tool to investigate some long-term impacts of logging. In this paper the rain forest growth model FORMIX3 is used for such a study. As main processes the FORMIX3 model includes tree growth, mortality, regeneration and competition. The calculation of tree growth is based on a carbon balance. Trees compete for light and space. Dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest. Tree species are grouped into functional groups. The model does not include the influence of nutrient limitations and animals. Based on literature data and field measurements a parametrization for Dipterocarp low land forest at Deramakot (Malaysia) was developed. Different logging scenarios for an initially undisturbed forest stand at Deramakot were simulated. Two different logging methods (conventional and low impact logging) in combination with different cutting cycles (from 20 to 100 years) were investigated. Three types of impacts on the forest were investigated: yield continuity, species composition, and canopy opening. Our simulation results indicate that too short logging cycles (<40 years) overuse the forest. The corresponding yields are highly fluctuating, the species composition is highly disturbed. For conservation of species composition and minimizing erosion risk logging cycles of 80 or 100 years in combination with low impact methods are recommended. These results base on optimistic assumptions for seedling regeneration, nutrient balance and animal diversity. A modification of these assumptions will presumably result in even more restrictive recommendations.","Environmental impact; Growth model; Logging; Management; Model; Simulation; Tropical rain forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031545759

To ameliorate this problem, vine cutting prior to logging has been recommended as a forest management tool. However, at present, little information exists on the economic and ecological impacts of vine cutting on tropical forest management. We undertook a study of vine management in a 210 ha forest stand. Our first objective was to determine vine species composition, stem densities, and the abilities of different vine species to resprout following cutting. Secondly, we assessed the degree of tree canopy connectedness due to vines and the amount of damage associated with felling trees with intercrown vine connections. Finally, we looked at the costs of vine cutting as a forest management tool. Vine density was found to differ among forest phases, being three times greater in young building phase forest than in mature forest. We encountered 63 species of vines in two (2 x 1400 m) transects and among the most common species, the degree of resprouting following cutting differed significantly. Typically, vines connected each tree to the crowns of from three to nine other trees. Felling trees with many vine connections resulted in canopy gaps that were twice as large as those created in the felling of vine-free trees. Although vine cutting prior to logging can reduce logging damage, it costs approximately $16 ha-1, on average. This is equivalent to 8% of the profits of a typical logging-only operation in the region. Reductions in the cost of vine cutting could come with the development of species-specific cutting prescriptions that would reduce the total number of vine stems cut by focusing cutting efforts on aggressive species likely to cause silvicultural problems.","Amazon; Climber cutting; Lianas; Logging damage; Tropical forest","Gerwing, J.J.; Department of Biology, , University Park, PA 16802, United States; email: jjg156@psu.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030708870

I addressed whether the habitat variation associated with logging and agriculture is correlated with the species richness and community structure in an assemblage of amphibians in the Tropical Wet Forest life zone in Amazonian Ecuador. I evaluated 10 variables describing environmental variation and forest structure at 23 0.5-ha sites and sampled amphibians using nocturnal visual searches of transects. Overall amphibian species richness increased weakly with distance to pasture but taxa differed in correlates of diversity. Species richness in the genus Eleutherodactylus increased markedly with distance to pasture. Eleutherodactylus species richness was highest at intermediate values of stand basal area, which contributed to my detecting only weak differences in species richness between primary and selectively logged sites. Overall, distance to pasture, basal area, and understory density explained much of the variation in Eleutherodactylus species richness. In contrast to Eleutherodactylus, species richness of hylid frogs was relatively greater in sites with low basal area, predominantly in selectively-logged forest. Patterns of amphibian species richness poorly represented eleutherodactyline frogs because the absence of Eleutherodactylus from disturbed sites was sometimes masked by increasing richness of disturbance-tolerant species. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that species occurrence varied with measured environmental variation; some species distinctly prefer less-disturbed forest. The generality of these patterns should be confirmed in additional studies. The results suggest that overall amphibian richness is not a good indicator of conservation value for disturbance-sensitive eleutherodactylines, which are nocturnal, rare, and difficult to identify. Elutherodactylines in Tropical Wet Forest provide a good opportunity for the development of indicator relationships for the conservation of a disturbance-sensitive assemblage. The mechanisms that result in the patterns of diversity described here are unknown and warrant further study. These observations, and the quantitative relationships developed here, suggest the use of empirical environment/diversity relationships for preliminary assessment of tropical amphibian diversity and in predicting the effects of forest management on disturbance-sensitive species.",,"Pearman, P.B.; Lab 1 Building, , Olympia, WA 98505, United States; email: pearmanp@elwha.evergreen.edu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031423541

Unfortunately, investments in 'natural forest management' are financially unattractive and governments are generally unwilling or unable to force loggers to make such investments. Even where these problems can be overcome, advocates of conservation need to carefully consider whether natural forest management will result in less damage than would have occurred otherwise. The answer to this question depends on what kind of human intervention would have taken place in the absence of the forestry project: little or none; uncontrolled logging or deforestation for agriculture. Only in the latter case does natural forest management unquestionably represent an environmental improvement. Finally, an assessment must be made as to whether forestry is a cost-effective way of achieving conservation goals.

This paper reports canopy removal and residual stand damage estimates for a controlled selective logging operation in lowland swamp forest of northeast Costa Rica. The logging procedure only harvested Carapa nicaraguensis (Meliaceae) trees of tit least 70 cm dbh (diameter at 1.4 m or above buttresses). Logging removed 6.3 trees ha-1 (SD = 4.2) from 28 ha, and 45.8 m-1 ha-1 from a 7 ha subsample. Canopy cover was 91% (SD = 4.5) in undisturbed forest, and 73% (SD = 12.4) in logged forest. Post-logging canopy cover was negatively correlated with the number of trees extracted ha-1. Prior to logging, 65% of total gap area was contained in gaps less than 250 m2. After logging, gaps of over 500 m2 represented 78% of total gap area. Stand basal area in 7 ha of inventoried forest was reduced by 18.3%, and 17.6% of residual stems were damaged or killed. Wet soil conditions required the use of 5.3% of residual stems to construct corduroy skid trails. Thus, 30% of all residual stem damage resulted from soil conservation efforts. Stem damage estimates were compared with those reported from uncontrolled tropical logging operations. Although absolute levels of residual damage during controlled logging were quite low, there was no conclusive evidence that total residual damage was relatively lower than intensity adjusted estimates of those other operations. In contrast, canopy removal during logging was lower than that in two other neotropical studies. Both residual damage and canopy removal can be decreased further by incorporating stricter foiling guidelines: measures to reduce necessary levels of skid trail fortification would also decrease residual damage. The results are discussed in the broad context of tropical forest management. A conservative approach to tropical forestry increases the possibility of sustainable extraction of the resource.","Forest management; Gaps; Sustainable extraction; Tropical forestry","Webb, E.L.; Dept. of Marine/Wildlife Resources, P.O.

The Insect Farming and Trading Agency (IFTA) of Papua New Guinea aims to return as much income as possible to village-level insect collectors. An increase in demand or profit margin in the insect trade could potentially benefit sustainable forestry schemes that include insect collecting. The sustainability of insect collecting is discussed. Species rarity, specimen prices, and species wing sizes are compared. Prices are greater for rarer species. Prices are correlated with wing size, particularly at the retail level, but rarity is not positively correlated with wing size. Consequently, it should be possible to selectively increase the prices of non-rare, larger species at the wholesale level. There is a large wholesale-to-retail price markup for some species. So, consumers are probably willing to pay a wide range of prices for some species, and therefore it may be possible for IFTA to raise prices for species when IFTA is the exclusive supplier and when there is an indication that there is low price elasticity. Although price increases may have a favorable impact on sustainable management of tropical forests, steady and long-term increased consumer demand for insects from tropical forests would likely have a more substantial impact. Income from extractive reserves is usually non-competitive with income from timber, hence a broad package of income sources is usually necessary.","Butterflies; Conservation; Insect trade; Papua New Guinea; Sustainability","Slone, T.H.; Div. of Biochemistry/Molec.

The causes of TMF loss vary across the globe and regionally-specific processes of loss exist. The role of some causes of forest loss (e.g. cattle ranching or logging) have been widely studied, and are relatively clearly understood. However, the specific contribution of other causes, particularly the role of smallholder forest farmers, is less well known and has been a subject of controversy and confusion. This paper explores the contextual causes (at the household level) of TMF loss around the Cross River National Park in south-east Nigeria. Local agricultural practices and household decision-making are linked to the wider political economy to explain the observed patterns of forest loss in the study area. By focusing on the household and the dynamics of forest farming at a household level, this paper reinforces the need for an alternative perspective on the role of small farmers in TMF loss in West Africa to that revealed by existing extensive studies of the region.","Forest loss; National Park; Nigeria; Small farmers","Ite, U.E.; Department of Geography, , Lancaster LA1 4YB, United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031544008

The rationale for the offset is that when logging damage is reduced, more carbon is retained in living trees, and, because soil damage is minimized, forest productivity remains high. To estimate the carbon benefit associated with implementation of harvesting guidelines, a monitoring program was developed based on 1) field studies for measuring carbon stocks and flows; 2) a computer model of forest carbon dynamics for simulating various combinations of harvesting intensity and damage; and, 3) a projection model for calculating carbon balance over the project lifespan. Seventy-five percent of the carbon stored in this forest is in biomass, and of this, 59% is in large trees (>=60 cm diameter); consequently, reliable estimates of variables related to large trees are critical to the estimate of carbon benefits. Allometric methods for estimating belowground biomass are recommended over pit-sampling methods because of low cost-effectiveness of obtaining precise estimates of woody root biomass. Sensitivity analyses of variables used in the simulation model suggest that maintenance of ecosystem productivity has a large influence on long-term carbon storage in the forest. Projections of differences in carbon stores between the reduced-impact and conventional logging sites rely on assumptions about tree mortality, growth, and recruitment; published data for comparable sites in Malaysia are probably appropriate for estimating forest recovery from conventional but not reduced-impact logging. Continuing field work is expected to provide the data needed to evaluate assumptions of the models. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Biomass; Carbon offsets; Logging damage; Malaysia; Monitoring program; Simulation model; Tropical forest","Pinard, M.; Department of Forestry, , Aberdeen AB24 5UA, United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031463121

Previous checklists are reviewed, together with sightings accumulated over the 1992-1995 period during which approximately 70 new species have been added to the reserve inventory, bringing the total to 478. Occurrence across the 12 delineated habitats, relative abundance and sighting documentation are given for each species. The avifauna of the B.B.S. is mixed biogeographically; in addition to a substantial component of lowland birds widespread throughout South America, it is composed of Amazonian, cerrado and chaco elements also. Representation from the Bolivian Yungas is minimal. Significantly, no less than four threatened and 15 near-threatened species have occurred, including the little known Bolivian endemic Unicoloured Thrush Turdus haplochrous, and the enigmatic White-winged Nightjar Caprimulgus candicans, known until recently only from Emas National Park (Brazil). Short accounts are provided detailing records of all of these species. Birds of the reserve core, consisting largely of humid tropical forest formations inundated during the austral summer, appear not to be subjected currently to any serious environmental degradation, although some subsistence clearance by Chimane Indians in the northern reaches of the reserve gives some cause for concern. Of much greater import, however, are changes occurring outside the confines of the B.B.S. These include increasing urbanization immediately to the west (and associated road upgrading) and forest fragmentation to the south brought about by logging. The latter is especially worrying because linkage of the B.B.S. forest block to surrounding forest is already physically tenuous, and therefore it is imperative that future logging activities be geared to minimize isolation occurring and the damaging restriction of gene flow. Monitoring in rainforest immediately south of the reserve should become routine to warn of putative avifaunal impoverishments. Extensive surveying of the 2,500-ha El Porvenir éstancia (savanna and related forest islands) due to be assimilated shortly into the B.B.S., which constitutes less than 2% of the area under consideration, has shown that it is used by no less than three threatened and up to nine near-threatened species. In the absence of data relating to other savanna areas (c. 15%) at present, the exact status of each species at the B.B.S. remains imprecise and begs for further research to be undertaken. Unfortunately, present management of the El Porvenir savanna is not conducive to the long-term maximization of populations of these species, several of which have local strongholds in this part of Beni. We recommend that the current policy of cattle ranching adopted by this éstancia should cease or be reduced dramatically, to minimize grazing and trampling damage, and that measures should be taken to reduce incursions of fires started wilfully in neighbouring properties. The Academia Nacional de Ciencias de Bolivia, which administers the reserve, should be encouraged to safeguard and enhance the savanna complement further by ensuring that the impending ratification of El Porvenir proceeds as quickly as possible, and by purchasing additional tracts of land to the south of the present southern reserve boundary, where feasible. Such actions should not only secure the future of the biota of the savanna habitat within the B.B.S. but also should ameliorate the degree of isolation which has occurred already by preserving the ""curiches"" (former river beds) and forest islands which act as access corridors for forest-dwelling and other birds.",,"Brace, R.C.; Department of Life Science, University Park, Nottingham NG7 2RD, United Kingdom; email: plzrcb@plm.life.nottingham.ac.uk",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031461618

These forests are treasured for their high biodiversity, a result of the country's unique geographic positioning, but also as an economically important natural resource. Although the early decades of accelerated timber exploitation in Indonesia demonstrated little concern for the sustainability of forest resources, recently a shift to genuine conservationist forest policies can be observed. These new policies, however, mainly relate to the forestry sector and much less to the ongoing conflicts between the state and forest-dependent people. It is still a commonly held belief that swidden agriculturists are responsible for about half of Indonesia's annual deforestation. In order to solve this problem the country has defined a number of measures that attempt to convert swidden agriculturists into sedentary cultivators. In this paper these measures are discussed, and they are juxtaposed to new insights on the nature of the dynamics of swidden agriculture and the role that forest management plays in this agricultural method. The official schemes only propose some sort of plantation development, which significantly reduces biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. With an example of swidden agriculture from West Kalimantan, including it's important forest management component, this paper demonstrates that developing such existing agriculture-forest management holds the potential to bring economic development to the region, while biodiversity is conserved.","Agricultural development policy; Dayak forest management; Indonesia; Swidden agriculture","De Jong, W.; Ctr. for International Forestry Res., P.O.

We used the mixed-mating model with the genotypes of 47 open-pollinated progenies at ten polymorphic loci, obtained through isozyme analysis. Seeds were collected on both logged and unlogged (control) plots, which were interspersed. A high multilocus outcrossing rate (0.78) was found for the global population, and there was indirect evidence for nonrandom mating for outcrosses. It is argued that this may be due to some kind of positive assortative mating, probably biparental inbreeding. Correlation of selfing between sibs was not significantly different from zero, and the portion of full-sibs among outcrossed sib-pairs was significant but low (0.16). We found significant differences between outcrossing rates when computing separate estimates for the 14 trees located on logged plots (t(m) = 0.63) and the 33 trees located on undisturbed plots (t(m) = 0.85). It is argued that the decrease in density is probably not the only cause of the decrease in outcrossing rate on logged plots. Lastly, several points concerning the reliability of the estimation are outlined. In particular, the downward bias due to ignoring null alleles during genetic interpretations of zymograms is quantified in a few cases by simulating artificial populations.","Carapa procera; Logging; Mating system; Meliaceae; Null alleles; Outcrossing rate; Tropical rainforest","Joly, H.I.; U.R.

Logging had been conducted using hand crews with chain saws and cable skidders. Logging directly affected 11.9 ha (12.9%) of the 92.3 ha logging area. Canopy cover decreased the most at logging gaps, and soils were most compacted on skid roads. Soil compaction was much greater on roads where more than one tree had been skidded. For the whole logged area, canopy cover declined 2% and compacted soils covered 3.8% of the area. Seedling height growth was unaffected by soil compaction, but seedling survival was less on compacted sites. About 50% of the trees and about 15% of the saplings were damaged in gaps and along skid roads. However, only 4.8% of the trees and 1.9% of the saplings were damaged for the logged area as a whole. The most common kinds of damage included scraped bark, snapped tops, and run-over stems. Although this logging operation had relatively low impacts compared with other logging operations in the Neotropics, it may not be silviculturally sustainable because its disturbance may be insufficient to promote adequate mahogany regeneration.","Canopy openness; Disturbance; Neotropical forest; Seedling growth; Soil compaction; Tree damage","Whitman, A.A.; MOCS, PO Box 1770, Manomet, MA 02345, United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030619407

For forests to recover from logging, one would predict recruitment and growth processes to be accelerated in logged areas relative to unlogged areas, facilitating increased recruitment of trees into the adult size classes. We examined this prediction first by determining the growth of 4733 trees over a 51 to 56 month period and found that growth rates in the most heavily logged area were consistently slower than in the two unlogged areas. In contrast, the lightly logged forest had similar growth rates to unlogged areas in the small size classes, but trees in the 30 to 50 cm DBH size cohort exhibited elevated growth rates relative to the unlogged areas. Mortality was highest in the heavily logged areas, with many deaths occurring when healthy trees were knocked over by neighboring treefalls. We found no difference in the density or species richness of seedlings in the logged and unlogged forests. The number of seedlings that emerged from the disturbed soil (seed bank+seed rain) and initially seed-free soil (seed rain) was greater in the logged forest than in the unlogged forest. However, sapling density was lower in the heavily logged areas, suggesting that there is a high level of seedling mortality in logged areas. We suggest that the level of canopy opening created during logging, the lack of aggressive colonizing tree species, elephant activity that is concentrated in logged areas, and an aggressive herb community, all combine to delay vegetation recovery in Kibale Forest.","Logging; Phenology; Recruitment; Seed dispersal; Seed rain; Tropical forest management; Uganda","Chapman, C.A.; Department of Zoology, , Gainesville, FL 36211, United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000226810

Planned logging was conducted with a rubber-wheeled skidder or a bulldozer equipped with a winch, while unplanned logging was conducted with a bulldozer not equipped with a winch. We found, for each commercial tree felled, unplanned logging methods damaged 16 more trees ≤ 10 cm dbh and affected a ground area that was more than 100 m2 greater than in planned operations. In the tree felling phase, the number of trees experiencing severe crown damage (i.e. topped) was significantly greater (Student's t-test; p &lt; 0.002) in the unplanned operation (7.4 vs. 4.5 trees/tree felled). Similarly, the number of trees smashed to the ground was significantly greater (Student's t-test; p &lt; 0.0006) in the unplanned operation (7.2 vs. 4.9 trees/tree felled). More trees experienced moderate or severe damage along unplanned skid trails than along planned skidder skid trails. These differences are particularly pronounced in the bole damage categories (7.9 trees ≤ 10 cm dbh smashed and 5.3 trees ≤ 10 cm dbh with moderate bole damage per 100 m of unplanned bulldozer skid trails vs. 5.3 trees smashed and 2.2 trees with moderate bole damage per 100 m of planned skidder skid trails). Per hectare logged, we found that tree felling damaged more trees ≤ 10 cm dbh than the other logging phases, with unplanned felling damaging nearly twice as many trees per hectare as planned felling (124 vs. 64). Furthermore, the unplanned area had a lower percentage of logging gaps containing one tree in them and a higher percentage of gaps containing two, three and four felled trees. The mean area of all gaps considered together was significantly larger in the unplanned operation (Student's t-test, p &lt; 0.0001; 355 m2, s.d. = 288 m2, n = 80) than in the planned logging operation (166 m2, s.d. = 118 m2, n = 108). Damage to individual trees was reduced in the planned logging operation by cutting vines 2 years prior to logging and by implementing directional felling. We estimate that the profit margins of companies that switched to planned logging methods would actually increase. The costs associated with planned logging are offset by the benefits of this approach, namely reduced machine operating time and labor per m3 of timber extracted and less waste. Furthermore, by implementing these techniques, more than 80 trees ≤ 10 cm dbh per hectare were spared damage during logging operations. By examining the way in which individual trees were damaged and in which the ground area was disturbed in five distinct logging phases, we are able to recommend planned logging measures that can reduce overall damage to the remaining stand by 25-33% and, thus, improve the likelihood of managing these tropical forests on a 30-40 year cutting cycle.","Brazilian Amazon; Forest management; Ground skidding; Logging damage; Low impact logging; Mechanized logging; Paragominas; Tropical forestry","Johns, J.S.; Ecology and Evolution Program, , New Brunswick, NJ 08903-0231, United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030301769

These data are inadequate to reveal the status of mahogany populations, both because they are incomplete in areal extent and because they do not reveal population parameters such as the existence or density of young trees smaller than commercial size. However, there is sufficient information on the regeneration ecology of mahogany to indicate that under natural conditions this species regenerates in essentially even-aged stands after catastrophic disturbances destroy many or most trees, and, in the case of fires and flooding, saplings and seedlings as well. Adult mahoganies tend to survive these events, and regenerate by shedding seed onto the resulting gaps or clearings. This ecological strategy makes mahogany vulnerable to logging, first because juvenile mahoganies are not found in the understorey, and secondly because logging operations shortcircuit mahogany regeneration processes by selectively removing almost all mahogany seed sources while leaving standing compelling vegetation of other species. Listing of mahogany in CITES Appendix II could provide both a mechanism to fill in gaps in information and an incentive to change current practices in favour of silvicultural management to provide for regeneration of this valuable timber species in forest subjected to logging.","Am azon; Belize; conservation; dynamics; fire; flooding; forestry; hurricane; Mexico; regeneration; stand; tropical forest","Snook, L.K.; Nicholas School of the Environment, , Durham, NC 27708, United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030469721

The need to assess the economic value of foregone biodiversity and other non-market environmental values lost through exploitation of tropical forests for timber is focused on. The failure to assess these foregone values may mean that timber exploitation is not socially ""optimal' and thus ""excessive'. The second theme of the paper is concerned with the wider policy considerations surrounding the estimation of non-market conservation values. The issue of exploiting forests for timber today as opposed to conserving them for the future raises complicated issues for policy-makers to resolve. A major problem is the presence of both market distortions and policy interventions that are biased against non-market environmental values in forestry. The result is too much conversion and not enough conservation. The paper argues that these concerns suggest a ""middle way' that emphasizes reconciling forestry with conservation through sustainable management of timber production in permanent forests and maximizing biodiversity regeneration in plantation forests. -from Author",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0029507760

Most forest loss results from agricultural clearing, but is generally preceded by forest degradation from destructive logging (Southeast Asia) or overuse of forest resources (South Asia). Tropical forests are highly variable, requiring a system of classification to guide management objectives; one such system is ecological life zone mapping. Forestry operations should reflect the need for both conservation and production. Most Asia-Pacific forests are managed on variations of a selection system. Logging damage is the most important forestry-sector threat to commercial forestry, reducing both future timber production and the availability of non-timber products. The short duration of logging concession agreements, nontransferability of concession contracts, and undervaluation of forest resources all contribute to forest “mining” practices. Alternative forest management methods exist: logging damage can be substantially reduced at little or no additional cost; small-scale mobile sawmills can increase local incomes while reducing the need for skidding; and Assisted Natural Regeneration can facilitate the reforestation of denuded lands. The best hope for sustainable use of forest resources lies with those who must live with the consequences of forest mismanagement. Local involvement in foresy planning, implementation and enforcement is essential.

The causal factors of natural disturbance are both endogenous and exogenous; there are major difficulties in the formal characterization of disturbance and of recovery after disturbance. As to the latter, the acceptance of classical generalizations of the nature of succession has led to particular difficulties in the assessment and interpretation of recovery. Tree fall, which creates gaps, is fundamental to the development of many forests, and has been most intensively studied in tropical forests of Central America and the Amazon and in temperate forests of North America. Tree fall is part of autogenic change; mechanisms of gap-filling and subsequent growth and species composition vary widely with forest type and geography. Disturbance by wind is particularly difficult to characterize. Wind varies along a continuum; the blow-down of an individual tree may be mostly due to autogenic processes of ageing and decay, whereas catastrophic hurricanes and cyclones may be defined as wholly exogenous. Nevertheless, the resilience in terms of species diversity of tropical forests following catastrophic disturbance by hurricane is remarkable. A number of studies support the view that the tropical forest in hurricane-prone areas is not a stable steady-state ecosystem but rather that heterogeneity is maintained by catastrophe. The ability to regenerate by suckers and the coincidence of regenerative space and gregarious flowering are important components of the response of rainforest following disturbance. For much of the world, 'fire is the dominant fact of forest history'. As examples, fire and its effects are reviewed for the northern boreal forests, oak-pine forests and north-western sub-alpine forests of North America. The effect of fire on species composition varies with intensity and frequency. That, together with the popular view of fire as unnatural and therefore unacceptable, places great demands on management of forests for all of their benefits, including national parks and reserves. These difficulties also affect management of other ecosystems, such as Mediterranean-type shrublands and heathlands where species diversity, productivity and cycles of regeneration and degradation are governed by fire as a natural disturbance. Shifting agriculture is a traditional form of agriculture used by at least 240 million people in the humid tropics. Shifting agriculture, together with wind, lightning and fire, is an exogenous disturbance which has little effect on soil fertility and on structure and composition of the rainforest which re-establishes after abandonment. As the intensity of disturbance of rainforest increases, resilience of the forest decreases and the current problems of extensive clearing for improved pasture and of uncontrolled logging are resulting in degraded ecosystems. Regeneration follows the often extensive death of trees caused by outbreaks of insects in many coniferous forests of northern America. This disturbance by herbivory halts increasing stagnation (as measured by decreasing rates of ecosystem production and nutrient cycling) and reinitiates succession. Other disturbances to forests occur through damage from ice-storms, snow avalanches, erosional and earthquake landslides, and volcanic activity; the development of Nothofagus forests in Chile and New Zealand is determined by such catastrophic mass movements. An extensive literature supports the hypothesis that natural disturbance is fundamental to the development of structure and function of forest ecosystems. It follows that our management of natural forest should be based on an ecological understanding of the processes of natural disturbance. Whether or not we want to do this, and the extent to which we want to derive all of the benefits from the forest, including timber, depends on social attitudes. Whereas humanism may treat conservation as the wise husbanding of forests in the interests of social traditions and harmony, animism may give nature unalienable rights. The conclusion from this review is that the ecological framework of natural disturbance and the knowledge of its component processes and effects provides the basis on which we can manage our forests as a renewable resource which can be utilized so that the forests 'retain their diversity and richness for mankind's continuing benefit'. Nowhere is this management more desperately needed than for the protection of the world's tropical forests, its peoples and their cultures.",,"Attiwill, P.M.; School of Botany, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Vic. 3052, Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028572834

Three catchments were covered with selectively logged lowland hill dipterocarp forest (W4‐W6) and three (W1‐W3) with secondary vegetation after forest fires. The control catchments, W3 and W6 reported in this paper, had no treatments applied. Reference monitoring at all streams was for 25 months and the total period of study reported here is 64 months. The soils in the catchments were mainly Orthic Acrisol in W3 and Gleyic Podsol in W6 and a mix of both soil types in the other catchments. Element baseflow concentrations were generally low and not significantly different from stormflow concentrations for all streams during the reference period. Concentrations were also generally consistently low for the two control streams during the whole period of measurement. Chemical inputs as wet deposition were low as a result of a high input from local convection. The rain forest on the Podsol had a tight nutrient circulation indicated by small net losses of macronutrients. The Podsol was found to have poorer conditions for soil mineralization and more surficial runoff, resulting in higher loads of S, C and N in the organic phases, with higher organic C/N ratio, in the discharge. Nitrogen was found to accumulate in both catchments. An almost double accumulation of N in W3 was attributed to a larger biomass accumulation continuing after the forest fire 3–8 years earlier. On the other hand, the Acrisol in W3 had much larger net losses of S, Si, K, Ca, Mg and Na. Most of differences could be attributed to differences in weathering between the soils and local mineralogical differences.

The devised multi-criteria assessment procedure, though only a crade first step, indicates which timber imports, from which countries, to the UK should be reduced or prohibited.

Deforestation caused by concession logging is often the result of harvest decisions which focus on short‐run profits rather than on long‐run sustainable harvest yields. A sequential‐decision model of this type of behavior is here developed which focuses on a logger's annual decisions of whether or not to remain in compliance with the terms of a concession contract. The contract stipulates harvesting procedures for a sustained forest yield, and noncompliance is taken to result in deforestation. An optimal decision policy for the concession logger is characterized in terms of optimal‐stopping theory, and is employed to construct payoff incentives which encourage compliance. In particular, a forest management problem is formulated which focuses on the effectiveness of partial inspection policies in deterring noncompliant behavior. General necessary and sufficient conditions for the effectiveness of such policies are established, and are given a more operational form for the Markov case. A numerical example based on actual concession‐contract data is also developed which suggests certain policy implications. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

Selected examples are considered from viral and parasitic infections (arboviruses, malaria, the leishmaniases, filariases, Chagas Disease and schistosomiasis) where disease patterns have been directly or indirectly influenced by loss of natural tropical forests. A wide range of activities have resulted in deforestation. These include colonisation and settlement, transmigrant programmes, logging, agricultural activities to provide for cash crops, mining, hydropower development and fuelwood collection. Each activity influences the prevalence, incidence and distribution of vector-borne disease. Three main regions are considered - South America, West & Central Africa and South-East Asia. In each, documented changes in vector ecology and behaviour and disease pattern have occurred. Such changes result from human activity at the forest interface and within the forest. They include both deforestation and reafforestation programmes. Deforestation, or activities associated with it, have produced new habitats for Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes and have caused malaria epidemics in South America. The different species complexes in South-East Asia (A. dirus, A. minimus, A. balabacensis) have been affected in different ways by forest clearance with different impacts on malaria incidence. The ability of zoophilic vectors to adapt to human blood as an alternative source of food and to become associated with human dwellings (peridomestic behaviour) have influenced the distribution of the leishmaniases in South America. Certain species of sandflies (Lutzomyia intermedia, Lu. longipalpis, Lu. whitmam), which were originally zoophilic and sylvatic, have adapted to feeding on humans in peridomestic and even periurban situations. The changes in behaviour of reservoir hosts and the ability of pathogens to adapt to new reservoir hosts in the newly-created habitats also influence the patterns of disease. In anthroponotic infections, such as Plasmodium, Onchocerca and Wuchereria, changes in disease patterns and vector ecology may be more difficult to detect. Detailed knowledge of vector species and species complexes is needed in relation to changing climate associated with deforestation. The distributions of the Anopheles gambiae and Simulium damnosum species complexes in West Africa are examples. There have been detailed longitudinal studies of Anopheles gambiae populations in different ecological zones of West Africa. Studies on Simulium damnosum cytoforms (using chromosome identification methods) in the Onchocerciasis Control Programme were necessary to detect changes in distribution of species in relation to changed habitats. These examples underline the need for studies on the taxonomy of medically-important insects in parallel with long-term observations on changing habitats. In some circumstances, destruction of the forest has reduced or even removed disease transmission (e.g. S. neavei-transmitted Onchocerca in Kenya). Whilst the process of deforestation can be expected to continue, hopefully at a decreased rate, it is expected that unpredictable and sometimes rapid changes in disease patterns will pose problems for the public health services. © 1993, Cambridge University Press.

To complement existing studies, we measured forest damage caused by the selective harvesting of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), a very low density species in the Bosque Chimanes, Bolivia. Secondary damage along main roads and skid trails accounted for most of the damage measured in the study site. Total damage was low (4.39% of the study area), but results from our simulation model suggested that damage could be decreased by up to 25% by requiring main roads and skid trails to be linear. We used our simulation model to investigate the relationship between harvest intensity and forest damage. At low harvest intensities, most forest damage occurs from the construction of main roads. As harvest intensity increases, secondary damage from skid trails and tree felling comes to dominate forest damage. Overall, less damage will result to the forest for a given harvest volume if the harvest area is reduced and harvest intensity increased. Additional benefits to increasing harvest intensity are that re-entry into the logged site can be delayed, allowing the forest more time to recover, and regeneration of light-demanding species such as mahogany can be enhanced. The main impediment to increasing the harvest intensity in selective harvesting operations in Latin America is the lack of international markets for lesser known species, although there is some local and national demand. © 1993.",,"Gullison, R.E.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544-1003, United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002913753

Drawing on Brazilian case studies from Acre (NTFP extraction) and northeastern Para (ranching and logging), we compare the ecological impacts of these three land uses and conclude that biotic impoverishment associated with them is qualitatively similar but quantitatively distinct. Each land use reduces populations of native plant and animal species and reduces mature forest cover. Forest conversion to pasture, practiced by both ranchers and, to a lesser extent, NTFP extractors, clearly provokes the greatest biotic impoverishment of the activities discussed, for it can virtually eliminate the native biota, reduces carbon storage in biomass, alters hydrology and, potentially, provokes regional climate change. For NTFP extraction to succeed as a conservation/development strategy, extractor populations will require reliable sources of income that reduce the attractiveness of pasture formation. Once organized, extractor groups may increase income by marketing new NTFPs and enriching abandoned agricultural plots with economically valuable trees. -from Authors",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027044339

As populations in the poorest parts of the world increase, the percentage of land/person continues to decrease. There are approximately 32 billion acres of land, excluding Antarctica, on the planet. That equals only 5.98 acres/person; however, not all this land is suitable for habitation or food production. 1.2 acres is too steep, 1.3 acres is to arid, and 1 acre is too cold. Also, the population of the world is not spread out evenly across the land; thus, in many areas the population density is so high that the demands placed upon the land are greater than its capacity to produce. The Green Revolution that lasted from 1950 through the mid 80s did increase the total amount of yield/acre. Unfortunately the price for such productivity was a degradation of the land. Chemical inputs have contaminated ground water and sterilized the soil, irrigation has caused salinization and water logging (which is a form of decertification), and new tillage practices have eroded the top soil. Grazing cattle have caused enormous amounts of soil erosion and deforestation has removed 911 million acres of tropical forest alone to make room for a growing population. Wood is the single most important fuel source for the people of the developing world; yet, as it becomes scarce from deforestation, animal manures and crop residues have been substituted which further the diminishes the availability of fertile land. It must be understood that family planning save lives, reduces suffering, and slows the damage to the environment. Family planning is the single best way to make an impact in the attempt to end poverty and hunger.",,"Smith, A.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026479513

Mounting evidence suggests that current logging policies overestimate forest regrowth by a wide margin, and are therefore not sustainable. The need for more reliable assessment of natural forest growth dynamics has led to the development of a vertically and spatially structured dynamic simulation model of natural forest development. The model accounts explicitly for biomass and tree numbers in five distinct canopy layers (seedlings, saplings, poles, main canopy, emergents). Energy accounting of assimilation and dissimilation rates leads to biomass, diameter, and height growth in each layer. Leaf mass in each layer determines photoproduction, and light and photosynthesis conditions in lower layers. Transitions to higher layers, mortalities in each layer, and seed events are accounted for. The basic model simulates the development dynamics of a forest gap. Parallel computation of spatially distributed single gap models with stochastic mortalities and seed dispersal provides a simulation of the spatial dynamics of the tropical forest mosaic. Simulation results are provided with parameters corresponding to unlogged and logged Malaysian lowland dipterocarp forest. © 1991.",,"Bossel, H.; Environmental Systems Research Group, University of Kassel, Mönchebergstr. 19, W-3500 Kassel, Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026330668

Presently the conversion of tropical rainforests is considered to be the most important type of change in this respect. For use in connection with the carbon cycle module of RIVM's Integrated Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect (IMAGE) a deforestation module has been developed. The purpose of this module is to relate deforestation rates to socioeconomic developments in order to develop long-term scenarios. Next to the major driving force: expansion of agricultural land, also expansion of pasture, commercial logging, fuelwood gathering, industrial and mining projects have been taken into account. Because of the close interrelation between growth of population and economies and the demand for agricultural products, energy and building materials, we find that the rapid destruction of the forests can only be halted by sharp increases in the productivity of agriculture and forestry. Plantation wood, as a substitute for fossil fuels, has to be used efficiently. Land expansion should take place according to land suitability for agricultural land, possibly even at the expense of pasture lands. Since data on deforestation and the underlying processes are very uncertain and at this stage in the model the tropical forests are aggregated into the three major regions the results can only be considered in a relative way. It is found that deforestation plays a significant role in the greenhouse effect, but much less than the combustion of fossil fuels. © 1991.",,"Rotmans, J.; Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and Environmental Protection (RIVM), P.O.

Forest revenues are generally very low compared to what they could be, due to low forest fees and low collection rates. The lack of concession fees encourages acquisition rather than management of concessions, and leads to the allocation of large areas of the tropical forests as logging concessions. Forestry departments in most West and Central African countries are weak, under-funded, and under-equipped. Until the forestry departments can be strengthened, a simpler system of forest fees that emphasizes bidding and concession fees is recommended. These recommendations are developed from a review of the major issues in West and Central Africa forestry set out in chapter 2. Identification of the issues was based on the authors' experience. The priority recommendations are developed in chapter 3.1, the paper also identifies alternative recommended forest fees in chapter 3.2. -from Authors",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026293149

The new ecosystems of this region are agriculturally unproductive, biologically impoverished, and far more flammable than the mature forests they replace. In the absence of fire, the forest regrows on abandoned sites, accumulating biomass and species at a rate that is inversely related to the intensity of use prior to abandonment. Forest regrows slowest on those rare abandoned pastures that were once scraped with bulldozers. The grass- and shrub-dominated old fields that form on some of these sites resist forest regrowth because of numerous barriers to tree establishment and growth. Knowledge of these barriers provides a basis for developing inexpensive techniques to restore agricultural productivity in old fields by implanting tree-based agricultural systems or to restore forest regenerative capacity in old fields by establishing trees that attract seed-carrying animals and ameliorate harsh environmental conditions. These restoration techniques will be needed over large areas of Amazonia if current attempts to reform degraded pastures fail. -from Authors",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026268740

Severe droughts have occurred previously but without causing such extensive fires. This extensive burning is a result of forests becoming more fire-prone after disturbance by logging. Rates of tree mortality after drought and fire ranged from 38-94% in logged forests and 19-71% in unlogged forests, while for saplings rates of mortality exceeded 80% in both forest types. Secondary succession after logging was truncated by fire with the result that the post-fire condition of a forest logged 6 yr before fire was similar to that of a forest logged 2 yr before fire. The impact of fire differs from other natural or man-made gap forming processes in that most pre-existing seedlings and saplings are killed by fire. This left the regrowth in burnt forest depauperate in species diversity and in regeneration of upper-canopy species. Logged and burnt forests suffered severe canopy loss and the ground cover was dominated by grasses (eg Imperata cylindrica) or woody creepers (eg Eupatorium odoratum). In burnt primary forest, however, canopy loss was less severe and there was a low density of grasses. The prospects for recovery of forest structure appear to be good in burnt primary forest although species composition may be permanently altered. In forests logged prior to the fire, however, prospects for recovery of forest structure are not good, especially if further burning occurs. Recovery of these forests depends heavily on the ability of the secondary tree species to shade out the vigorous grasses, the continued presence of which may herald the conversion of the forest to unproductive grassland as has occurred widely elsewhere in the tropics after over-intensive shifting cultivation. -Author",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024873868

One result of these changes in land use is the release of CO2 from the cleared vegetation and soils. Although there is uncertainty as to the size of this release, it appears to be a major source of atmospheric CO2, second only to the release from the combustion of fossil fuels. This study estimates the release of CO2 from tropical soils using a computer model that simulates land use change in the tropics and data on (1) the carbon content of forest soils before clearing; (2) the changes in the carbon content under the various types of land use; and (3) the area of forest converted to each use. It appears that the clearing and use of tropical soils affects their carbon content to a depth of about 40 cm. Soils of tropical closed forests contain approximately 6.7 kg C · m-2; soils of tropical open forests contain approximately 5.2 kg C · m-2 to this depth. The cultivation of tropical soils reduces their carbon content by 40% 5 yr after clearing; the use of these soils for pasture reduces it by about 20%. Logging in tropical forests appears to have little effect on soil carbon. The carbon content of soils used by shifting cultivators returns to the level found under primary forest about 35 yr after abandonment.

The fragility of these forests, i.e. their reaction to outside forces, is determined by their nature and by ecological principles, both of which are largely objective. The forest, as a complex living system, acts as an objective entity. If utilization exceeds what the forest can sustain, degradation will set in and eventually may effect essential ecological processes and diminish genetic diversity. The degree of permissable utilization of TMFs is difficult to judge because of the richness of species, the woody, long-lived character of many plants, the complex interactions between animals and plants, and the many gaps in available knowledge. The time scales of effects and change are particularly important. In determining the economic use of TMFs while maintaining biological, physical and social values, the following twelve points should be taken into account: 1. There are essential distinctions between a. TMFs and other types of forest, b. lowland and upland forest, c. primary and secondary forest, and d. intact and altered forest, Planning for each type should take into account its kind, status and scarcity. For example, well drained against less well drained sites, greater versus less soil fertility, large homogeneous areas or large heterogeneous areas compared with small ones. 2. The values of TMFs are great and varied, particularly those of intact species-rich TMFs at low altitude on well-drained soils (e.g. supply of timber, protection of soil, regulation of water regime, food and shelter). 3. Utilization only for wood production seriously diminishes many other values of TMFs. 4. Sustained utilization requires maintenance of ecological processes which include preservation of genetic diversity, though not necessarily on the same area of land. 5. The prospects for sustained utilization of TMFs are very few, because of: a. species richness b. predominant woody (long-lived) character of the plants, c. interdependence of plants, animals and forest dwellers, d. low density of most plant and animal populations, and patchiness of species occurrence, e. general soil poverty and susceptibility to nutrient depletion and transportation, f. long time needed for regeneration and the tendency to regenerate to secondary types. 6. With proper management some use of intact TMFs can occur without ecological damage, e.g. for tourism, seed collection and non-destructive scientific research. There is a risk of slow degradation with hunting-gathering, and the collection of minor forest products. TMFs cannot be exploited without great ecological damage for purposes such as woodchipping and other forms of ""integrated utilization"" (use of whole trees, sometimes including leaves, bark and roots) and logging by hand tools or with machinery. 7. Harmful exploitation should be discouraged. Some of the remaining intact TMFs should be protected in combination with harmless exploitation as previously defined. Approximately 10 to 25 per cent of the remaining worldwide primary TMFs should be protected in properly managed protected areas. 8. Land types derived from TMF ecosystems, namely secondary forest, modified forest, transformed forest, and degraded land, often can be managed productively. Sustained utilziation should be concentrated on these sites, rater than on intact TMFs. 9. A distinction between planned exploitation and spontaneous exploitation (mainly inappropriate shifting cultivation and encroachment) is useful, since the problems and possible solutions differ considerably. 10. Even where mechanical logging and other severe forms of utilization must be and are carried on, there are ways and means of lessening their impact and slowing the rate of degradation. Since these may reduce short-term profits, the cooperation of foresters, engineers and economists needs to be promoted. 11. The promotion of a capability classification and suitability assessment of tropical forest lands based, for example, on landscape units should be a major goal for IUCN, MAB, UNEP, FAO and other agencies as the first step in overcoming ecological problems in TMFs. 12. Well conceived out and documented land use plans are needed on a catchment or regional basis, to show which parts of the forest land are separately allocated to preservation, ""conservation"" (in the sense of the World Conservation Strategy), regeneration (i. e. careful exploitation), clearing and so on. Plans based on demonstration models and case studies are the only sure means of integrating these uses with economic development of TMFs so as to maintain biolgical, physical and social values. Integration of preservation with any other use on a single unit of intact primary TMF is considered impossible by many ecologists. © 1985 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250114347

The climatic implications of these changes are briefly discussed. West Africa spans a suite of vegetation zones ranging latitudinally northward from tropical rainforest to desert scrub, and comprises environmental problems from extremely rapid deforestation of the tropical forests in Ivory Coast or Ghana to desertification in the Sahel. Historical vegetation changes have been digitized on a 1° × 1° grid map based on a literature survey of government censuses, forestry and agricultural reports, supplemented by atlases, and other historical, economic and geographic sources. The principal processes of land cover modification during the last century include clearing of the natural vegetation for agriculture, grazing, logging, and degradation of marginal semi-arid to arid ecosystems by excessive grazing or cultivation. Forestry surveys for West Africa suggest clearance of around 56% of the forest zone; estimated losses for Ivory Coast, Ghana, and Liberia range between 64% and 70%. Estimates of total land conversion range between 88 million ha, from the digitized land use map (Figure 4) to 122.8 million ha, from extrapolation of forestry data (Section 3.1). The change in albedo corresponding to the land use modification is relatively small, using conservative estimates for desertification amounting to an increase of around 0.4% regionally over 100 yr and 0.5% since agriculture began. Thus 4/5 of the total albedo may have occurred within the last century. Additional assumptions regarding desertification and a lower albedo value for tropical forest compensate for each other and do not significantly alter the result of the initial calculation. The maximum zones of increased albedo are concentrated in the forest zone (4°-8° N) and savanna-southern sahel (10°-12°) which correspond to zones of maximum agricultural and population growth. Between 13° N and 17° N, the albedo change is small or negative due to both less intensive land utilization and replacement of scattered vegetation on exposed sandy soil by lower albedo irrigated crops. These estimates may represent a lower limit, particularly if desertification is more extensive than initially assumed. Under an extreme assumption that the entire Sahel zone between 14°-20° N has been desertified, the regional mean albedo could increase by as much as 4%. This represents an upper limit to likely historical anthropogenic disturbances of the land surface. Although historical climate records show three major droughts during the 20th century (1910-1920, 1940's, 1969-1975, possibly continuing into the 1980's; Nicholson, 1980a; Hare, 1983), and stream flow fluctuations which correlate well with precipitation (Faure and Gac, 1981;Palutikof et al., 1981), these records do not appear to indicate a regional secular decrease in precipitation as suggested by several climate models. Evidence for apparent desiccation or 'desert creep' (= 'desertification') may be attributed, in large part, to adverse changes in soil and stream hydrology caused by anthropogenic disruption of the vegetation cover. © 1985 D.

The forests are vulnerable to fire and as they contract in size animal populations exert increased stress. Providing biological rhythms are accounted for there seem to be few constraints to crop replacement. Exploitation of the forests often damages regeneration when logging is uncontrolled. This suggests more logging control is necessary to increase the availability of silvicultural options. Examples of seedling persistence, felling rules and silvicultural decisions are given for the dipterocarp forests of Sabah. © 1976.",,"Fox, J.E.D.; Biology Department, W.A.

Data were also collected on some birds and squirrels. Selective logging that causes only moderate habitat disturbance does not seem to result in a significant decrease in the densities of several primate species. Whereas some species adjust readily to moderately disturbed habitats, other species may have difficulty in maintaining a breeding population in logged areas. A review of the literature plus our own data suggest that rain forest birds and squirrels seem to be the most disrupted by selective logging of their habitats. While some of the other mammals are directly harmed by selective logging, others are endangered only by the human encroachment that often follows. Suggestions regarding enlightened tropical forestry practices, additional studies of the influence of selective logging, and the establishment of forest preservation areas are also discussed. © 1975 by S.
